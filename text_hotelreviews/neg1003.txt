the rooms were too dark and warm after shaving i got on a plane and realized i missed half my face the bathroom mirror was placed right on top of the toilet bowl which was absolutely disgusting another design flaw was that you had to move the toilet seat up and down in order to flush the toilet the bedroom windows were painted shut which made it awfully stuffy hot and unbearable in the room it was difficult for bad smells to escape since there was no ventilation in the room the walkway outside the hotel room stank of chemicals and the hallway looked soulless like student dormitories one should not be paying so much money for such a low standard hotel which did not even include breakfast the staff were from anywhere else but britain which did not help make our british experience any better
