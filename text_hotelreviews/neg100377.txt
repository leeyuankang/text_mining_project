staff obviously badly coordinated people kept trying to come into our room happened times in two half days room showed lots of signs of age despite the hotel being relatively new its design wasn t very impressive either nor were furnishings and size i m honestly not sure what makes it a five star hotel for me this was a classic four star level which is fine but makes the hotel rather over priced despite the significant booking discount
