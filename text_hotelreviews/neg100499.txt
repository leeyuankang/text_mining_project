the bed was ordinary good sheets but standard bed nothing like sofitel beds i didn t like coming from the other side of the world and having no view when i could tell the hotel was not fully booked i didn t like not being able to book the curzon mondrian through concierge i didn t like housekeeping knocking on my door to get in at i didn t like cups stained from previous users i didn t like not being able to reduce the aircon down lower than degrees as we had come from winter and needed it a bit cooler
