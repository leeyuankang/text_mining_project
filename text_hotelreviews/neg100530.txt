on late arrival from the tube after a great few days in rome i thought this would finish off our trip with a bit of style we came in the front entrance via the restaurant bar and it was like rocking up to a night club security removing an inebriated man from an event that had been on during the day was a bit distracting the room was swanky but the view not great that comes with an added x price tag as instructed by the hotel when i requested via booking com a view if available we gave that a miss the food and drink prices in the restaurant were extortionate and really limited the extent to which we could enjoy what was on offer which kind of defeats the object we heard a lot of us accents and anticipate a lot of the guests were from the us and i believe the hotel is part of a us chain so that might make sense next time we will be happy to look for funky uk owned hotels if you really like the look of the bar you can enjoy that as a non guest along with all the other great places to eat an drink on the southbank without the hefty accommodation price tag
