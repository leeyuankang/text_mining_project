only two negatives the first obviously seems to be a trait all over europe being from australia we dont need to sleep in high temperatures each time we left the hotel each day we would come back to the room with the temperature reset by house keep to degrees we would drop it to our comfort level and then it would get reset the next day a tad annoying the strange one was the room obviously came with a hair dryer what was strange was it was of the incorrect plug to what was set in the room which was not european standard funny one
