the restaurant and bar areas are lovely but the restaurant menu was somewhat limited and more to sharing platters than to plated meals although plated meals were offered on the room service menu a menu which was oddly enough not available in the restaurant a somewhat more conventional restaurant or cafe menu would be appreciated and while the room was very well equipped there was no outlet in the bathroom for the hair dryer so the hairdryer had to be used in the bedroom which was a bit awkward
