the stay was a complete dissapointment for me and my colleauges at check in nobody was given a room before the were not ready at all rooms at a time became ready no information on hotel amenities from the reception staff they were just interested in credit card overpriced restaurant with scarce menu no a la carte for breakfast on weekend just standard buffet not a star no sparkling wine or champagne had to ask for my coffee for times and wait it for minutes late check out promised by booking com was not granted besides the reception told to come later and later to check that is not normal room keys discontinued to work a couple of times i could not fond any difference between a standard and a superior room description and pics are all the same the hotel is not worth its money and a star rating
