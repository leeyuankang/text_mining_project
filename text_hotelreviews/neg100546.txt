very basic selection of tea coffee instant didn t fit with the hotel branding we were only in a standard room but i have had better in other much cheaper hotels the view was also not great but we expected that in the grade of room we had ordered we got a good deal on the price but without that it is a very expensive hotel the breakfast was very expensive and i expected more for the price no omelettes eggs benedict or smoked fish providence of sausages and bacon not shouted about so i expect this isn t a priority for the hotel although it is for us
