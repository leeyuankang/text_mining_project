we were dissapointed by the spa only steam bath and no sauna at all it was also separated between men and women so not very good experience if you are in couple my main dissatisfaction concerns the front desk i forgot my credit card and even if the room was payed in advance they refused to accept us in the room if we don t leave per night as deposit i know by heart the number of my credit card the security code and had my phone for the security connection the room was payed with the same card on my name and i had id with me but they insist that i should show the plastic finally i was accepted with only deposit but if i didn t have friends in london to borrow some money it could be a very poor weekend of course it was my fault to forget my card but if i know everything by heart it could be treated as an internet purchase and anyway treated in more friendly way
