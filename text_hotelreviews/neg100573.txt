hotel not too flexible on early check in a strict policy of checking in after pm i called the day before to request an early check in and was told by the staff i would be accommodated at my arrival the staff had no recollection of my request and i was forced to change in the spa shower before my meeting not the service i would have expected from such a posh hotel brand
