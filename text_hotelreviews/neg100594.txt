most everything was good in the hotel accept for the front of house staff the girl who checked us in was absolutely fine but another girl tall blonde rotund had the attitude of the it s not my job variety when i asked for help she wasn t at all courteous she was judgemental listened in to our conversation with the other girl on reception and flashed a look of complete arrogance whenever we looked her way not good for a hotel which prides itself on its attitudes to the arts and artists flamboyance and self expression mostly the rest of the hotel staff from the bellboys bar staff and services were all absolutely fine and should be congratulated for their abilities at putting up with such an incongruous person as her but we also had to speak to the concierge and it took times explaining what we wanted before he even managed to look away from his computer screen then he was miles away and barely conveyed his answer
