i didn t like that receptionist or probably costumer manager messed up a congratulations card and gave it to me instead of my girlfriend but at least we got vouchers for a cocktail which was nice we also didn t like the fact that for the star hotel there were no slippers and bathrobes and no one really bothered to help us with our two luggages even thou it is a star hotel
