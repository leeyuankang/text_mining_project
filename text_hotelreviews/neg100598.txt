they advertise the spa and it seems very appealing we didn t try any of the treatments but you get access to the relaxation area and steam rooms i was actually expecting a proper spa with sauna and jacuzzi or at least the steam rooms to be in the shared space where you could relax with your partner but it wasn t like that
