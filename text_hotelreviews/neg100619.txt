requested twin beds which we were told is not possible after half hour of discussions we paid for an upgrade to a room with an additional bed when returned from our event at midnight we found we had not been given the upgraded room so then spent a further mins at reception attempting to sort it only to be told the upgrade was more expensive than we had been told in the afternoon all in all thoroughly disappointed with the service and attitude of staff
