the only minor comments i have are as follows there s no pool in the spa my friend and i wanted breakfast on the last day which we didn t prepay for as we had brunch and other things planned so didn t need it both days when we got to the restaurant they said the only option was the pay for a continental breakfast so that was annoying as i m sure last time i stayed there there were a la carte options anyway we left and went elsewhere
