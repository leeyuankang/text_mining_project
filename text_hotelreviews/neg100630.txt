after spending for room we couldn t get to sit down in the bar and was ask to get up when we sat down you have to book seats but was misinformed when we emailed to ask about the seating we also had a opportunity to book upstairs bar but was again misinformed and we didn t book ahead apart from that lovely location but not worth the money for room
