sadly the guests who frequent are loud and obnoxious types we did not sleep our first of nights due to a hip hop party that led to many guests partying in the hallway we were on the top floor i went out of my room twice between and to tell them to be quiet no one answered at the front desk the night we didn t sleep as there was some constant machine noise that went on all night again calls to the front desk went unanswered it was a pity because the rooms and the restaurant staff were amazing
