offered a free drink at the bar in the restaurant all very awkward in there staff questioned us on arrival accepted we just wanted a drink in the afternoon so no diners there or expected as far as we could see sat at the bar and ordered drinks free meant only house wine or heineken not a lager drinker wine was fine but disappointed at limitation of offer saw a table near window bar stools high for us year olds and got off bar stool to go there immediately questioned by staff about what our plans were did escort us to table another member of staff asked if we were eating then half way through glass of wine another asked if we would like some desserts then cleared the table of cutlery etc all of this just made us slightly uncomfortable the plan was to think about what we were going to do as we had just arrived in london and at the hotel whilst we had a couple of drinks but the atmosphere didn t make us feel welcome so walked to another bar for cocktails and ate elsewhere shame as in every other area of hotel the staff were extremely helpful bar restaurant staff were very polite in all their enquiries but made us feel like we shouldn t be there so free drinks we re not as pleasurable as hoped
