it s a five star hotel and well priced for that but you don t feel very special for the pampering you need to up the ante in london and the cost of course i thought the wine list prices were out of control in the restaurant where s the need in that we spent literally hundreds of pounds between the cocktail bar and the restaurant and i m not sure it was worth it to get their star rating they must have ticked all the right boxes but the room my room was quite compact there was no bath and it felt very spare and i don t accept this passes for minimalist design i doubt i would go back but would look for something else in the price range and see my score comes out at and that was boosted by the good score for the staff who i thought were excellent here but which only impact my choice to return a little this means according to my own rules it s out of the running as i tend to go for and above does it deserve superb not on my card
