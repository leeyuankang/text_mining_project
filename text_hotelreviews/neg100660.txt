family visiting from abroad we decided to stay in this over priced hotel for one reason only the rooftop bar so that we could watch the new year fireworks when i booked the hotel there was no mention that we would need to buy tickets to be allowed in a bar in the very hotel we paid to stay this is a complete rip off i booked to stay in the hotel and never received an email informing of this otherwise i would have cancelled our stay and chose to stay somewhere much cheaper and bought separate tickets to the fireworks we were deprived of this once in a lifetime experience because we only found out the day we checked in and all tickets were sold out we were told it was advertised on their website after i had made my booking i had no reason to go on their website so i did not see the information about the rooftop bar had we known this we would have stayed elsewhere advertising the rooftop bar as a guest facility without informing every person who booked to stay on the december that we would have to buy tickets for the event was false advertising we were not the only guests who felt robbed
