i only didn t like the fact that the place is pretty far away from all major sports and then the when district and circle line is close you have to bestially take a taxi or walk it wasn t huge problem for me as i love to walk in london but with cold weather it might be annoying still i understand that this is not the hotel downside the hotel itself is ideal
