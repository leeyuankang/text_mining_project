not allowed to park the car yourself and no parking really close hotel guests have no priority at all on the restaurants and bars and on the top bar we were asked to move from sofas even when they were empty as they take them all as reserved but restaurant and bar of the hotel are still very nice no real spa or swimming pool as some internet pictures would suggest
