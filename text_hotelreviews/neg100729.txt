the lobby sometimes gets crowded with people who want to visit the rooftop bar and they are stumbling around and can be quite rood to residents of the hotel i think the bar should have a separate lift or it should be managed a bit better high speed internet was really expensive given how much i was already paying for staying here i think it should be complimentary at least with some rooms the remote controls were not working properly and although i asked for a new one it still kept playing up sometimes
