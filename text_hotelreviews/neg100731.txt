reception service was beyond poor for what you expect at a hotel both at check in and check out the large reception desk was attended by only two receptionists both serving the same client i had to wait for nearly min which is not when you expect at a hotel especially on a business trip when you have colleagues and a car waiting outside when one of the floor staff pointed me to one of the receptionists who would attend to me the receptionist told me she was busy attending another customer also attended by his her colleague and when at check out i commented on the subpar reception service i was offered a free drink from the bar next time i frequently travel on business and have never come across such service separately the hallways are endless and lit so dimly that it s impossible to see the room numbers given they are written on the side of the wall and not on the doors won t be staying there again despite the fancy furniture
