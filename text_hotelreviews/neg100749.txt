service at breakfast was atrocious waiters were always short staffed so rushing around and bumping into customers without saying sorry very chaotic and poor compared to everything else in the hotel even the coffee was poorly made so presumably the barista station was undermanned the cocktail bar and reception staff were awesome by comparison
