rooms are a little small we stayed in a superior room and barely had enough space for our suitcases they do still manage to squeeze in all the essentials though biggest disappoinment was the distance from public transport having never been to london before i didn t think this would be an issue it is a good minute walk from southwark underground station or minutes over the river to blackfriar s station this can become very tedious after a few days it is worth noting i had broken my foot a few weeks prior to the holiday so having to wear a moonboot all the time wasn t helping there are also no small grocery stores or atm s within a minute walk these are not the hotel s issues but worth considering if these are services you value when holidaying the hotel itself is an amazing place with a great atmosphere
