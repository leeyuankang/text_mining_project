shame they don t have a pool and that the gym is in the basement would have been great to be on a running machine overlooking the thames staff were nice and service levels were adequate if i were paying the rate i paid however the price per night is more than double weeks after my visit and for that price i would expect a higher level of professionalism than i experienced and for them to go the extra mile
