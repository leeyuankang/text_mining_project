sea containers restaurant i had booked a special table by the window for our lovely weekend away our table was near the open terrace but next to the staff s work station we could have been a little closer to the river view and away from this station the menu was unusual sharing meat main courses the double pork chop wasn t a chop it was squared off slices off what looked like a pork loaf and the crackling was missing not a good experience
