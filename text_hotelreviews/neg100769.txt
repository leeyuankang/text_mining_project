the hotel took a deposit from my card for my night stay even though i paid the whole booking in advance and even though i asked if it was necessary because i would pay cash for anything extra the front desk gentleman told me it was necessary the deposit was unexpected and really not appreciated when we were on a budget for the trip after converting money from a foreign currency and the money wasn t returned for a week
