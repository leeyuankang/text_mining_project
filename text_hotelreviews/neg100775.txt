the private garden was pleasant but noisy due to nearby construction works in any case i believe the noise should be temporary and it is a nice place to smoke a cigarette and to finish some work what i didn t really like are some architectural inconveniences i asked where the stairs from my floor to the reception are located and the answer was something like it is difficult to use the stairs from this floor you will get lost because they pass through the offices they never saw me where the stairs are while most people don t use stairs i believe that it is a matter of principle for a quality hotel to provide it s guests with easily accessed stairs
