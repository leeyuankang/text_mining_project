there were restaurant bills over gbp was added to room charge which wasn t mine the hotel staff removed the charge after told them it was not mine i noticed there wasn t any signature on the bill i don t know how they let someone ate at the restaurant and just gave a room number without given first last name or sign the bill a day later i received another charge on credit card related to room i emailed the hotel but no replied since this charge wasn t that much about dollars so i decided to let it go it is a nice hotel but i wouldn t not rated a stars hotel it was stars amenities so don t expected slippers or robs also be aware of all the charges to the bill
