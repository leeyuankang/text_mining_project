rooftop bar was fun and comfortable music got too loud as night went on to talk without yelling in each other s ears not good when you are two couples trying to catch up tasting platters were nice but a little more than just two choices would be appreciated champagne shed blocked the view and light in the little lounge area which would have provided a really good people watching area
