when i booked i was informed i d be given priority early check in and priority late check out i didn t need the late check out but wanted an early check in when i called the hotel directly to organise this they were very unhelpful and unwilling to give me early check in i even got staff at booking com to call them directly and even then they were unable to help with this request which was very disappointing and started my experience with mondrian negatively
