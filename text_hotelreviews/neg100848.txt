overall my night stay was very good and i liked the hotel a lot things could have been improved and if they were fixed i wouldn t hesitate to stay at the hotel again i stayed in room a studio and while the room was nice it s biggest drawback was that it was not possible to open any of the windows for fresh air staying in a hotel for nights without the ability to do that is very off putting i appreciate the need to minimise risks etc but most hotels these days allow you to open windows even if only to tilt them open i can t stand a c on at night so having to turn it off and not having fresh air was a big downside for me and would put me off using the hotel again for a star hotel superfast wifi should be standard hotels never seem to understand that one of the worse things they can do to guests is charge them for wifi in these days when we all need internet connections charging for a useable fast wifi service is equivalent to charging to go to the toilet it would be great if the hotel group made a stand and said our guests deserve the best and to provide this as standard instead of seeing it as a separate profit centre it really is a no brainer it does not cost the hotel anything to do it and leaves guests feeling they had a good hotel experience and wanting to come back for clarity there is complimentary wifi in the rooms however it is not very fast at all and if you need to do anything quickly or stream media etc it struggles to cope let s face it there are hundreds of hotels like this in london people vote with their feet make them want to stay by including details to the small things and you will have loyal customers for a long time two small further points there needed to be a foot rest to use with the armchair this should be a given in a studio room the tv on the wall was offset considerably to the left of the bed it needed to be square on to the bed
