beware the upgrade offer that came up on my mobile phone a couple of days before my stay clearly indicated that the upgrade would be to a room with a river view this was not the case the non negotiable upgraded room had a very poor view but two double beds and a bath neither of which i wanted or needed when i mentioned this they said that they already knew that there was a fault on the system and that they were not in fact offering a river view at all they did not offer a refund for this anomaly even though i didn t get what i had paid for a room with a river view that view would now have cost me a further vat on top of the upgrade price already paid also do not believe the prices on the breakfast menu they slap on an automatic service charge but it is labelled as vat well that s how the staff member explained it and they then make provision on the bill for an additional tip on top of that charges are not transparent beware of hidden extras
