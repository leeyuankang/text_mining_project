for me this hotel would have been a experience of the spa had a pool also my partner and i treated ourselves to a massage in the spa while the massages were tremendous it was a shame the women s steam room wasn t working when we visited i can say as a young professional the prices are a bit steep if you re looking for a deal we easily spent over on drinks in one night in the rumpus and room service breakfast for two was almost but we were looking to indulge and for an experience and that s exactly what we got the pampering was well worth the extra cost
