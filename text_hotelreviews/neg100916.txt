when we went for breakfast it was minutes before breakfast was to end the hostess was very rude to us after we ordered just at the end of breakfast what appeared to be a very important customer was seated beside us we were completely ignored for the whole of our time in the restaurant as this table was fawned over we weren t offered coffee top ups water or any form of service you would expect from a five star establishment my food was burned and did not taste very good to be ignored is one thing but when a table is seated next to you and plates upon plates of food is being brought to them whether they wanted it or not adorned with juices coffees teas and fresh fruit while we are being completely ignored is incredibly unpleasant and left us with a very poor view of the restaurant and hotel then we were charged a lot of money for a very poor breakfast
