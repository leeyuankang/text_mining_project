in common with other reviewers we had booked through booking com and received an invitation to upgrade to a river view a few days beforehand for this came from the mondrian when we arrived we were told that was for a city view and that a river view upgrade was over at first we were told this couldn t be resolved but after an assistant manager got involved a room that fitted the description was found incidentally the was exclusive of vat not made clear also agree with other reviewers that the pre authorisation isn t clear either and not something that is common practice in my experience so although it is a beautiful modern hotel there are issues that undermine the proposition they obviously don t trust their customers to pay their extras
