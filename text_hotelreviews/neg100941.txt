too expensive night didn t deserve the money although a hotel the rooms too small clean and quite new but the rooms have a small view to thames mostly to sky skrapers and to under construction buildings the room had a window note a balcony the room had no bath robe and for sleepers we had to request for the comments on booking were very good and the photos showed the hotel on the river so you suppose all the rooms with river view have the good view of thames but no i wouldn t recommend it in addition when we came back we discovered after days bites from bed bugs in our body we have the suspicion that it is from the hotel but we are not sure in the price the breakfast wasn t included for which we paid pounds person it was good and from the restaurant we had a good view of thames and the bridge
