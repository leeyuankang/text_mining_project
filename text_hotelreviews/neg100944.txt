there is no jacuzzi sauna or indoor pool in the spa while we took that kind of hotel to benefit from those facilities cheap coffee in the room no nespresso for that price cheap shower gel nice packaging but bad quality a bit like the hotel therefore the very high price is completely not justified we arrived late in the day and were told that they just had rooms for disabled available its is not very romantic to be in such a room and we had planned a romantic weekend not practical either as the shower and toilets are too low we could move to another normal room the next day that we did but frankly who likes waisting time to do so when you just have one weekend the viennoiseries from the breakfast were dry and cheap the location of the hotel when its raining or cold or when you carry a suitcase walking to waterloo station or southwark is just too far im very surprised that people give a good rating to the location of this hotel the surroundings are empty there is no closeby subway station on the map it looks close to oxford street but practically it will take you mn to get there we paid around pounds per night to basically sleep in a bed in london if i had known i would have taken a standard hotel in the center another common practice i didn t like they charged without asking pounds extra on top of the price of the room on the day of arrival to cover for the potential future expenses we may have during our stay for those abusive prepayments my bank is charging fees that is a percentage of the amount if they had asked me before i would have given a cash deposit instead typically the kind of hotel who does not respect its customers assuming they are rich and don t care about money that fits well with the snobbish attitude from the reception and the fake high level of service when we arrived a valet took our suitcases
