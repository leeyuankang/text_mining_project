sea containers restaurant music extremely loud pumping out like a club atmosphere certainly not a place to recommend intimate dining for valentine s day or communal dining for good conversation very poor overall dining experience although food was good our orders were wrong on two occasions probably because the staff couldn t hear us or concentrate properly due to the din we sat by the window which was lovely looking at the thames until smokers stood in front of the window and the view was then backsides smoke i would recommend the hotel itself but not to eat there not value for money
