the tv kept cutting out into it being on didn t bother us too much as it was just on for background noise whilst getting ready or when we was having a cup of tea in the morning mini bar was a bit pricey as to be expected night cost us plus refundable deposit which i didn t know about until arriving checking in hence the slight mark down we had the private patio however it didnt feel very private i felt like people above us could see us which made me feel a bit uncomfortable
