in the bar downstairs i received a fantastic old fashioned cocktail it tasted exactly as it should and was brought over to our table i expected the hotel s other bar would be the same i was wrong i ordered another old fashioned from the bartender upstairs his lack of communication was one of the clear indicators that he didn t want to be there his lack of any positivity was another possibly the most miserable bartender i have been served by his low levels of enthusiasm really showed in the drink too not only did it taste completely different but it was truly one of the worst drinks i have had tasting of watery whisky with a hint of something vile my favourite drink had been turned into the worst considering a round of drinks cost i couldn t even finish mine making it terrible value for money before heading back to our room i thought i would make use of the facilities that was a mistake upon opening the door i was greeted with a slippery patch of vomit which was a perfect was to ruin my brand new bought that day suede boots after trying to keep the remaining boot vomit free i realised there were puddles all around the room accompanied by puddles of water from the sink it looked like someone had been having a water fight and plenty of paper towels thrown around the room i returned to the bar and informed my cheery bartender who didn t say a word and walked away i sincerely hope he informed someone but he didn t return for a little bit we returned to our room having had a perfect night celebrating our anniversary really brought down a notch or
