where do i start i had high expection of this hotel after reading previous reviews weeks prior to staying at the mondrian i had stayed at m by montcalm shoreditch based on reviews and pricing i went with mondrian for my anniversary in which my partner was displeased i had to admit for the pricing we did not get a fraction of the facilities or service considering we was upgraded to a superior room at mondrian which normally a night in the region our stay at m cost for the night the deluxe room at m was much bigger than mondrian superior the tv was much bigger also the in room facilities i could not fault mondrian around a inch tv in an akward position for watching a computer desk and side chair with mini bar m inch tv all controlled from the side of your bed mood lighting under floor heating queen bed electric curtains m even provides you with elemis products in the bathroom beautiful bars nicely priced food and a luxury spa on the ground floor provided free detox drinks robes jacuzzi swimming pool and shared gender steam rooms and sauna fantastic on the mondrian advertisement i saw a swimming pool picture but upon arrival no swimming pool i was then told it might be at there miami base but i did not search mondrian miami i put in london but was showed apparently a mixture of pictures some of london some of other locations so mondrian did not have a pool or jacuzzi they did have a steam room but in the changing room so separate gender my fiance was dissapointed no additional touches they had a relaxation room that looked luxurious but all you do is lie there and relax a spa needs to offer me much more than a relaxation room also there was no luxurious products given in the bathroom no elemis no sanctuary nothing like that basic product was it bad no was i expecting more yes m by montcalm are currently doing stays for if i were you especially in terms of a younger couple i am my partner
