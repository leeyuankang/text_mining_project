we only used the hotel as a base and did not use any of the facilities so i cant comment on these there was no parking available so we had to park elsewhere at an additional cost of we stayed at the hotel from for nights and there was not a single xmas decoration in sight which was disappointing we paid for nights through booking com which was great value
