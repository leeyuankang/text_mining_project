it s was a shame that the roof top bar was darkened hip half full with empty reserved tables with loud bass music making it impossible to have a non shouted conversation we left without spending it was more akin to a basement windowless disco than an elegant terrace to meet take in the view and relax with a drink and a conversation the even greater shame was that it was not open during the daytime to take a coffee or drink and do that same thing just seemed a bit of a waste of that special location
