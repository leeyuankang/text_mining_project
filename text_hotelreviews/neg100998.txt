very poor communication on meal and then rooftop bar package terrible value for money promised seating in the bar area as we paid for bottle of champagne and table and seats on the night there was no table and no seats they advised that they had miss sold the package no compensation offered also pre authorise your credit card but then take the money but was told nothing would be taken they now have of my money that they say will be paid back would not recommend due to the poor ability to sell correctly and also a very curt attitude from the female restaurant manager on new years eve all in all a massive disappointment having spent over for two night stay not to be recommended
