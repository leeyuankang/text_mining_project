although parking at the hotel was not advertised and therefore we parked elsewhere when we arrived at the hotel it was offered and by then it was too late staff were dressed very casually and at first thought they were guests we wanted to drink in the bar in the evening as a family and the bar was one of the main reasons to stay at the hotel but to our suprise they asked us to leave because our son was and not although i understand the reason for this we were not informed at time of booking about this and felt embarrassed when we were asked to leave we were guests at the hotel and my son was accompanied by us
