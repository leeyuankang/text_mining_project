poor choice of cocktails in the rumpus bar on the menu there was a list of so called classic cocktails however i hadn t heard of any of them so they can t be that classic we tried a few but we wouldn t try them again presentation was a bit dull cocktails should be a bit of fun over the top and colourful perhaps that s why they keep the lighting so low a pina colada would have been nice at breakfast there were only cold plates to put our hot breakfast on
