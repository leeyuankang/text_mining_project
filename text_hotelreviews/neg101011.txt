breakfast staff were quite sloppy and forgot our order tea should have been served in pots went cold quickly bath robes should be available it was not clear to us that there was no pool in the spa we tried to book a treatment days in advance and were told it was too busy hotel guests should take priority perhaps breakfast is very overpriced most hotels include continental in the price of the stay
