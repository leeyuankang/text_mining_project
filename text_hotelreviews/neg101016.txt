just the sleeping night the emergency exit light in the room is really bright so i kept waking up then the alarm went off which we didn t set at maybe we should ve checked it the final night we were woke up by hammering in the hotel it was on a monday so i understand people have started work at this time but being our last lie in day before starting work again on tuesday it was a bit of a disappointing way to be woken
