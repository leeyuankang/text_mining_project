as we were celebrating our son s birthday for which we had booked three double rooms i was told he would find a complimentary bottle of prosecco in his room on arrival unfortunately this did not materialise even though i had spoken to the concierge in advance who told me he might even be able to substitute with proper champagne yes the reception staff made a reduction on the breakfast bill the next morning which was an acceptable gesture but i would still have preferred my son to enjoy the birthday gift from mondrian things like this let the side down in my opinion
