everything in this hotel costs money i paid euros for nights and still had to leave a pound deposit this did not include breakfast it is super expensive and you are no even guaranteed a place at the bar as a guest for drinks you need to reserve somewhere to sit beforehand so in essence as a guest you do not get any special treatment for your money
