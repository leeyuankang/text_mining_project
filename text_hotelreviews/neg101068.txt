very large busy hotel used to smaller boutique hotels in london made the experience a little corporate for us for the money there were a few things in our room that could have been updated easily ie no coffee machine which is pretty standard now in good hotels in london phone was broken which made room service inconvenient cheap toilet paper there are other hotels that we have stayed in nearby that have paid a little more attention to detail which i feel counts when paying per room
