room was quite basic no bath only robe very expensive minibar we were in london for proms in the park dressed down accordingly which didn t seem to go down well got the impression that this hotel is really only for very young trendy people could not get a drink in the rumpus rooms at night as the place was packed with non residents so nipped round to the oxo tower secured seats cocktails immediately
