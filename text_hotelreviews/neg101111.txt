a small gripe about the morning duty restaurant staff at breakfast time again this was the same at christmas time when we stayed here every request seems a chore a hassle asking for a pot of tea or more milk or even the bill you see the sighs as they walk away you even see them avoiding your gaze as they know you are needing perhaps ketchup or more butter etc this is a big let down customer service is vital in the hotel industry the front desk staff not all but some could do with just a little more cheer greet with smiles it would go along way especially when you ve travelled a day to get to the hotel for most people london is leisure the holiday begins at the hotel check in a smile goes a long long way after a long long journey
