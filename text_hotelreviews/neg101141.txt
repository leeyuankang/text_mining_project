apart from our room not being ready as guests we weren t told there was a dress code for the rooftop bar i booked it as thought it a perfect place to propose to her my partner had flip flops we were barred from entry yet other people were going in flip flops and shorts we were eventually told we would be allowed in for one drink by the stuck up bar manager we said no because we would feel uncomfortable as wouldbe watched like a hawk considering we were booked in for hours we complained to the concierge who was as helpful as a bout of haemorrhoids we left the hotel for dinner and i sent a complaint email to the hotel and they responded that evening offering us either a free drink in their downstairs bar i said no as they had already ruined the opportunity for me to propose to my partner they offered us free breakfast which we took up with them
