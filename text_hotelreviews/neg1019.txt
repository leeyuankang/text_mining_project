its just really really cheap furnished no seating possibility except one office chair in the room nothing comfortable it is minimalistic furnished which would be ok in a way but you just don t feel home there glad i just booked it for one night to try a new place since i am frequently traveling to london and was searching for a place closer to our office in fleetstreet
