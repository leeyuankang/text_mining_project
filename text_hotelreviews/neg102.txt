there was a girl working in the restaurant and we asked her a few things about the dessert but she didn t know alot the staff that evening didn t walk by our table once and when they did they didn t take our plates the staff the next day though was more experienced and very outgoing so our dinner of the night before was immediately forgotten and we had a great night at your restaurant
