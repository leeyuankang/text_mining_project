the breakfast system is very over complicated and needs to be looked at it would save your staff a lot of time not having to try to explain how it works our party of six chose things from the menu as advised but no one told us that if you didn t have the continental breakfast you would be charged for coffee or tea even though the other breakfast was more expensive anyway it caused a bad atmosphere over breakfast which could have been avoided make the menu easier and you will be saved the hassle of complaints from customers the food at breakfast was good and it s a shame to spoil the good ratings just for this
