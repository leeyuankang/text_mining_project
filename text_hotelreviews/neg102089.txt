the fact that there was a massive party going on till which we was the room above of after complaining once i was told that it finished at fair enough which then i found out that i was lied to it was horrendous the noise was we was moved at half in the morning after an hour of complaining for then the room was being used by someone else and they had given it up for ours as they was part of the party in the end we got a refund but i think if i had of paid full price a night i wouldn t of got it back
