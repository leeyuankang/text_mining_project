if like me you prefer a lovely boutique hotel with a bit of personality and character rather than some bland and a little bit boring hotel this is it friendly quirky and really central so very easy to get around really small stuff in the overall scheme of things which could be improved and which would take it from great to exceptional would be when phoning down to reception no response just a recorded answerphone message picked up and when i did leave a message no one got back to me did book a wakeup call for never happened wasn t a drastic disaster but could have been if we had onward transport booked information binder in room needs to be reviewed to make it helpful simple and above all more informative eg single page showing helpful numbers for hotel internal use eg reception bar restaurant wifi code would help instructions for coffee maker our friends couldn t work out how to use theirs so didn t bother everyone needs coffee could include a map showing hotel location and surrounding attractions and streets would help you max your stay finally enough coffee pods for the max number of people using the room we got one coffee pod and there were two of us our friends got three coffee pods but didn t use coffee maker as no instructions all very easily solved having said all of the above we would definitely stay again so i m being picky coz i want to make everyone s stay even better
