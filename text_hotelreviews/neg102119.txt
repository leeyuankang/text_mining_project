staff didn t seem overly professional and were a little slow to respond eg when we ordered tea or asked for help working the frankly quite cryptic electronic blinds the roof terrace wasn t very well organised so somehow doesn t come together as a comfortable location for a drink we didn t get towels replaced on the second day and had to share one between two we didn t have time to wait for reception staff to respond judging by previous experience
