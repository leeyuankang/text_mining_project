obviously people were smoking in a non smokers room before mattrasses and pillows were smelly and i felt very uncomfortable was not able to take a shower standing upright hose was broken and no fixation on my height possible you can feel that investments into this hotel have been made into nice door knobs but not into beds and showers overall a very very dissapointing stay for me hope other rooms are better and cleaner it is a never again for me
