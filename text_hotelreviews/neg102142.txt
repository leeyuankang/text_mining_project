for a star and to pay for the night i would not expect to have a big red wine stain on the carpet next to the bed to have to ask for any other extras such as a vanity set shower cap shoe shine etc i also would not expect to have to pay for mineral water i did mention this at check out and she did waive the charge for the water we drank apart from the decor there was nothing that made me feel like i was a valued customer staying in a star establishment
