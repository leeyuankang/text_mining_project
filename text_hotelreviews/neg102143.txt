room service was delivered without cutlery no salt pepper or condiments we had sausage and mash it tasted like airplane food heavily blended mash grizzle sausages and gravy tasted like granuals reallr not worth the money the room seemed a bit battered lights not working pieces missing from glass it also smelt like someone was partying in there the night before we really wanted it to be amazing but we were quite disappointed and was very expensive so feel let down best violetta
