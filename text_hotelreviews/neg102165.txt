having said that the gentleman who served us breakfast was delightful a couple of girls who arrived after us were served before us and had actually finished their breakfast before ours arrived as we were taking a train home this was quite annoying as it made our journey stressful losing half an hour to receive our breakfast when the breakfast arrived we had specifically asked for runny eggs they were solid we heard our server ask the chef if they were runny and he was told yes so it was not his fault we would have asked for them to be changed but by this time we had no time to do so
