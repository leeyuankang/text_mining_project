unfortunately the room was laid out by an architect designer that most likely never stayed in a hotel the placement of the desk was awkward as it left no room between the bed and the desk chair when the chair was pulled out or being used electrical outlets are poorly placed bathroom lighting was very poorly placed and the location magnifying mirror was a placed well for a giraffe but not a normal sized person
