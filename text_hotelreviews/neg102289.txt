the suite is interesting but honestly not really worth the extra money it is split on two levels which requires a card for the electricity they only provided once asked the staff was very friendly and helpful to supply a second but would be easier to do it with the suite considering the setup also it has an upstairs and downstairs the small tv by the bed downstairs is much more limited in channel selection lucky if you have channels so not a big deal but you need to be upstairs to watch television all in all it s probably easier to stay in the standard room
