the advertised price for the room included breakfast when i got there one receiptionist said there was no additional price and it was included the next day when we went to get breakfast the new receiptionist said it would be an additional lbs per person so we declined your advertisement was incorrect and we want compensation for this we wanted a room that included breakfast and this was not the case with this hotel major confusion ensued
