we had stayed a few years ago at the previous nh south kensington which was about a half mile away that one had better restaurants close by on gloucester rd and old brompton rd the restaurants nearby to this one on earls court are on a much lower level so we had to walk a fair distance most nights to kensington high st to get to a better class of restaurant they have a make your own espresso machine at breakfast which might seem like a nice idea but sometimes you had to wait i d really rather have the staff bring me coffee which is the way it was at the other hotels we stayed at this trip using the elevator involved inserting your key card which sometimes didn t work same for operating the lights within the room hadn t seen that before in england
