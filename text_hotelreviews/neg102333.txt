no milk for the tea coffee there was parking available which is a god send in this part of london but access was difficult needing the sole key for the hotel to be used to open and close the gate a logistical challenge the staff were friendly but not overly breakfast was of poor quality though plenty of it and oh also the hotel was not good value for money
