our room was in serious need of redecoration the walls were dreadful bits of plaster chipped and desperate to be painted the bed was too firm for my taste so after a night i felt like i had been hit by a train the air con did not work properly which made the temperature uncontrollable reported to reception but no feedback or resolution the main window did not stay open without a bag propping it up the temperature of the room spoiled our stay
