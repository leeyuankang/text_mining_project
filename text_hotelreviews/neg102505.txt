our room was large and more like a one bedroom which was great but we were surprised that it was not renovated little run down looking and the shower leaked into the bedroom we called and they were supposed to fix it but never did it was clean but needed a face lift the hotel lobby was beautiful so we were surprised by the room also there is no air conditioning anywhere in the hotel that was shocking and a big problem
