the pictures on the website are lovely but our room had a horrible view of a plain small interior area there was no art in the room the air conditioning throughout the hotel was broken they did put in a portable air conditioning unit that helped keep things cool but it was very noisy we asked for a new room with a view but were told those were mostly private apartments we paid euro for a room about as interesting as a shoebox the location is great but we won t stay there again for the cost the room was very disappointing we ate there for dinner seated inside because the lovely courtyard in the pictures was closed the steamroom and pool both closed at so we were unable to use them but they looked lovely
