do not go there if you are not parisian the room for euros for a night does not cost it if the hotel discriminates you in any way service was horrible even the restaurant at the hotel refused to receive an order for a dinner plus even cleaning personal was rushing us to leave the room to clean it i am shocked with this service i do not recommend this hotel it was the most expensive and the worst hotel i have ever been
