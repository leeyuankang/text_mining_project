as a four star hotel with a pretty pricey stay we never even thought to question whether or not there would be air conditioning upon arrival on a hot summer night after waiting for a taxi at gare for an hour the last thing we expected was to walk into a degree room we were unable to sleep and could not book elsewhere at sort notice staff was helpful and we ended up being comped the room but it wasn t that fun of an experience the hotel overall is beautiful the hallways and walls definitely need some paint attention and upgrades to bathroom but building has a lot of parisian historic charm
