i didn t like that neither booking nor the hotel let me know in advence that the air conditioning of the whole building wasn t working so when i got there with degrees i found out in my room that there was a portable fan opening the window was out of the question as all the kitchen and smoking smells from below would get in the room i didn t sleep well not even one of the three nights i was there it wasn t possible to ask for a refund and move to a different hotel the spa does didn t have a good service and the receptionist was totally unkind
