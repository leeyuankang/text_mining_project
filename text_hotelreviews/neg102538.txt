if you are looking for a typical parisian atmosphere a small hotel in a narrow alley you will be disappointed better you should stay at the st louis island that is really romantic this one is a great hotel on the busy rue rivoli but if you are looking for a star comfort hotel with a great location in paris that is a very good option
