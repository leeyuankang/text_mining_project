i had seen the propertys availability on booking and since i have had positive experiences in spa hotels i was looking forward to it unlike most hotels there was no real welcome eventually a young woman asked me what i wanted i said to make a reservation for two nights without consulting any kind of file she announced nous sommes complete i looked back at the page i had opened where the hotels availability was still plain to see at that moment i should have left already the hotel had displayed poor customer service eternal optimist i booked it on line and cheerily announced that i had done so rather than apologizing or offering me a coffee while they put the situation to rights they turned away from me and fumbled with their computers after a while a shabby room was ready no charm rather bare soulless room i thought never mind i ll go and relax in the spa only to hear that the hammam was out of order again with scarcely an apology so all that was available was a chlorine filled swimming pool i must admit they did carry my case to my room but when i left obviously struggling towards them to make check out and claim back the they suspiciously demanded from me as guarantee there was no offer to help me with my luggage not when there was no longer the possibility of more money they drop the customer i told a man that i was disappointed and he announced mechanically that he was sincerely sorry and blamed it all on the young woman who had dealt with it rather than offering any kind of compensation or making a personal gesture to show that the customer is valuable to them maybe they could have offered me breakfast which they were selling for i had glanced at the breakfast and like everything else it looked shoddy and rather vulgar the only nice thing was the little courtyard and maybe its proximity to the louvre
