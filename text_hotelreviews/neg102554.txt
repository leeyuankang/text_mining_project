the hotel is in a great location steps away from the tuileries m tro stop hotel is very clean and easy to find when the rooms came available to check in the staff took forever to bring the stored bags out for us to take to the room they wanted to take the bags themselves though after waiting forever it wasn t worth paying them a tip since they took so long to give us our bags we were also short on time to get to a reservation but they didn t care the management also tried to tell me which elevator to take when ultimately i could have taken either elevator to get to the room two of the rooms were across the hall from each other but the man insisted that we take different elevators pointless checkin was very antiquated with printed papers and folded forms and i feel like extra fees were paid at check out
