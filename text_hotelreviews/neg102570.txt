although the location of the hotel is great the asking price is on the high side the breakfast was poor for the price when i checked in i was charged for the whole duration of my stay which is ok but i was also asked for an extra deposit which i find it excessive i have not met this before it s either the hotel room rate or the deposit not both during any of my other check ins at various hotels throughout the world and i do travel a lot mainly for business i didn t also like during check out when i was asked whether i have used anything from the room bar that morning after my negative answer the hotel clerk told me to wait for a minute in order to check that with the room service personnel i ve only seen that before at a second rate chinese hotel and it certainly left a sour taste for goodbye
