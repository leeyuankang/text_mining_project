the welcome staff in particular one woman was very rude to us as she looked down her nose at us as if we weren t worthy of staying there which made us feel uncomfortable as there was a mix up with payment we sorted it in the end however she made us feel as if we didn t belong there however the consierge staff were amazing so friendly and so so helpful along with the breakfast staff and spa staff
