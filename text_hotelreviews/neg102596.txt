the standard sized room was so tiny it is not comfortable to share with another person almost impossible to move insode the room without touching each other the closet space was size of an paper it cannot be called a closet so we had to ask the staff to change our room but they were really not helpful and very unfriendly and implied us to be demanding finally we had to pay euros per night to upgrade our room the new room they gave us was another case where there is no toilet in the bathroom toulet was located on the other side of the room it was the most uncomfortable hotel experience for me as if all these are not enough hotel concierge lost a document delivered to our name to the hotel it is definitely not value for money we were a group of and had rooms in total i was the one to choose the hotel after all this bitter experience i had hard time with my friends
