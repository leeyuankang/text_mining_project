we liked how the hotel is presented on booking com we made a reservation based on that however the reality is that the hotel offers totally different rooms than advertised and in fact the hotel rooms are terribly different and worse than the ones booking com present the hotel managers chose the nicest rooms and put them on booking com after making the booking and arriving to the hotel we faced an total shock the hotel room was awful it didn t even remotely looked like the photos the hotel room looked incredibly old it was a total extreme you can take a look at the advertised photos and compare them with the photos of the room there s captured the bathroom we have been given when we complained about this to the hotel staff the were rude to us insulted my girlfriend and couple times lied to us straight to the face along with the hotel manager later when solving the matter the hotel charged us for the stay didn t refund anything the booking com team said that they apologize they didn t do anything and keep supporting the hotel on their website we have been scammed by this advertisement stay away from from this hotel
