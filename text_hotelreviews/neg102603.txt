this hotel lacked soul it was cold literally and lacking any warmth or atmosphere no welcoming reception or bar we were sent to the bar for a free drink when the computers failed and nobody could check in however noone was working in the bar which looked like it had never been used no one seemed to be looking after the guests anywhere apart from the few receptionists the breakfast was poor value for money lack of choice no non surgery cereals cold coffee and cold dining room too which seemed to be heated by tiny stand alone heaters such a disappointing stay we won t return
