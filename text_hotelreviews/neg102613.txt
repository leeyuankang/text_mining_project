the layout of the hotel is a bit strange and the reception isn t very inviting the room we were in had an adjoining door which meant we heard the couple next door a lot including them having sex the lady at the spa was really rude someone took my robe and slippers and instead of just getting me a new pair she made me wait for ages soaking wet and there were no towels then reluctantly gave me a pair of flip flops and told me to bring them back otherwise we would be charged for them
