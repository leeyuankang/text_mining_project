i would rate this a star hotel not a star the service particularly the bar service late at night was really poor and the housekeeping service was inconsistent the biggest issue we had was we could not use the changing room when visiting the spa and were asked rather rudely to change by the swimming pool in full view of other swimmers this was totally unacceptable
