on arrival we were originally put in a tiny room about sqm that stank of smoke had broken fittings in the cupboards scuff marks over the walls and significant stains on the carpet and chair with a small double bed as the room was supposed to be with a king bed it was far from what was expected i declined the room and requested to be put somewhere else was told the property was fully booked and i would have to pay more to get a superior room i then stated i would not stay in the given room under any circumstances i demanded a refund then suddenly there was a room available the room was a disabled room with a wet room i e not a proper shower bars all over the place and again nothing like what was advertised they then found another room that was similar to what was advertised the bathroom with this room did not have a proper shower only a hand held when our chauffeur arrived the reception staff did not alert us
