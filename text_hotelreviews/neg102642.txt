i thought my room was the oddest shape with a column right next to the bed i had to be very aware of this when going to the bathroom at night the mini bar cabinet has seen better days further it had a mobile safe on top of it that i could carry i miss the objective of keeping my belonging safe here what an eyesore so i had to move it out of site and put the bed cover over it a poor room for the money the hamman was not hot enough and pointless even sitting inside when looking up at the newer part of the building the paint is flaking all over the wall not a pleasant site to see whilst lapping us the sunshine with guests
