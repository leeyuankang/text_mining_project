i booked a room with square meters for days when i got to the hotel at night they told me i was upgraded to suite for free however i didn t go paris for work no one would visit us i don t need the living room in the suite the bedroom is extremly samll and very uncomfortable but it was too late at that time what i need was to sleep asap next day when i came back to hotel from a tired trip in the city i asked them to change my room they told me it s too late and suggested me to change for the last day and the last day they did change for me but it was just room with squaremeters and surprisely they overcharged me when i checkout i would like fight against them but the flight wouldn t wait this is the worst experience of my trip in paris becareful about this hotel
