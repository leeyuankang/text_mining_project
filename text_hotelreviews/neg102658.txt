the evening restaurant staff was the worst i have ever experienced in europe the evening of sept the first night of our arrival we ate at the hotel restaurant the food was decent we had fish dishes but the waitresses were lazy forgetful and did not bring us bread despite repeated reminders until we were served the main course they forgot to bring the butter and despite repeated reminders they finally brought the butter by that time we had already finished our meal and lost all appetite the saddest part was that the restaurant was not even busy it was empty or tables remaining waitresses working it was clear that they do not care about their jobs this slaos explain why on a thursday night the hotel restaurant was close to empty at about p m no wonder france is in a decline i will never stay at this hotel again lastly the carpeting in our hotel room looks dirty for an alleged star hotel it only has paper cups in the room not even glass
