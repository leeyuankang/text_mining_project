the room provided at first was a great disappontment the roof was so low that you could touch it if you put your hand up high there was no hanging room for any cloths and no room to put two bags plus no tea facilities so you had no choice but to demand an up grade and pay the extra the desk staff were not the same as what we had on our prior visits plus on one occassion our room was never made until that evening additionally the breakfast cost was expensive if you only wanted a basic snack they charged a tax even though we had pre paid our bill with booking com that was a joke overall we could not believe in the change in this hotel in less that years since we had been there unfortunately to the worse and not the better as stated before this was at least our fourth visit in this establishment but its very central to all you need to do in paris i would closely look at it again and ensure the same issues do not arise in our next visit to our favorite city
