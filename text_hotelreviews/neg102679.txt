the room with twin beds did not resemble the online photo accurately the photo online showed the room having a couple feet at least between the beds and surrounding the beds to separate them the room i was given had twin beds that were abutting the walls and could only be separated by a inches a key factor in choosing this hotel was the amount of space shown in the photo between and surrounding the twin beds i ended up paying extra for a room that looked almost as spacious as the one shown online they negotiated with me on the price but this was a disappointment after a long trip we were spending a week there so i paid the extra it would have been nice if the pic that was associated with the room chosen approximated the actual room size and space between the beds at least i could have reserved another room online ahead of time and i would have known what to expect we also had to wait and it took time to look at the other rooms at one point they mentioned that they might not have another room after traveling all night this was not an ideal welcome the staff was really nice and did their best to accommodate me and all other experiences as the hotel were great
