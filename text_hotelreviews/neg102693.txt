the hotel has no airconditioning and our room on the top floor was like being in an oven the room did not get any breeze as it faced an internal courtyard we were told there were cooler rooms and requested a move however we were instead given a second fan we did see some portable airconditioning units being delivered to other rooms however again our request was declined our room was also located next to the lift well with inadequate soundproofing so we could hear the lift moving day and night the staff in the restaurant and bar were somewhat disinterested in serving us and sent as back and forward between them both arguing over who was still serving drinks in the evening the fitness centre was nothing more than a few bits of cardio equipment in an unventilated basement room it was just too hot to use in the heat i had high expectations about this hotel and was disappointed i ve stayed in far cheaper hotels with better facilities and airconditioning if you are visiting in summer i would advise you to choose somewhere else
