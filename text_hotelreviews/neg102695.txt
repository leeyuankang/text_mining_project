despite i have booked a suite in order to have a more comfortable room the room was with really low ceiling i am not tall but i could easily touch the ceiling with full hand i guess the ceiling was meters maximum there were rooms with higher ceiling but i i guess as always the hotels give the worst rooms to people booking from booking com the furnitures were very old the room was like made years ago and never renovated my friends who also booked their room through booking com had a room with higher ceilings but this time the air conditioning was not working they had some kind of portable air condoning with some pipe going out of the window booking com should really do something about that this is the reason i less and less booked through booking com i choose the hotel at booking com but then i am making the reservation directly at the hotel web site usually the price is more or less the same but even little more expensive i have a proper room
