the fact that the air conditioning had been turned off for the whole summer they say its a technical fault it isnt my uncle is a air conditing engineer and there is no fault that cannot be fixed in days slightly longer if a certain part is needed but rarely and that the hotel had not let people know that and give them the option to cancel they also always show on their website pictures of rooms you will never stay in the actual rooms they give you are horrible when you ask for a change the staff will lie and say the hotel is full this is not true my recommendation check on line if they say this but really my recommendation is dont stay in this hotel unless you like tyrolean style rooms in the attic with no air conditioning
