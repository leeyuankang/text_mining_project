rooms are dusty and dirty as you can see on the picture the carpet of the junior duplex suite has black patches this is not considered star rating at all for rooms like that if you are going to stay in this hotel booked the duplex suite these room would be much more rated as star and worth your money than the other rooms my kids and i fell sick due to the room being extremely dusty they should up kept their rooms if they want to call themselves star hotel very disappointed
