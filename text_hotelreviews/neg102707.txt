the safe was on the floor of the closet so uncomfortable to try to open we were three and the cleaning staff only supplies two bath towels the breakfast was good but lacked variety and quality and of course my biggest pet peeve is when hotels offer free wifi but it doesn t work or it s non existent i even had their hotel it tech come to our room and he wasn t even able to connect us one day i had to use their business center hotels at this price range should at least offer paid in room wifi or more routers on a floor instead of one by the elevator for rooms
