originally booked the slightly better double was smaller than we wanted would be fine normally but were spoilt in switzerland just before but we asked for an upgrade to a junior suite simply because my fiance likes the windows open with fresh air coming in yes it was only degrees celius and the only window opened onto the emergency stairwell junior suite was great as it opened onto the courtyard plus they didnt charge us the full upgrade cost which i find is the best thing for a large hotel to do was still euro for nights extra though
