i didn t like that i ordered champagne on arrival for my partners an it wasn t there when i called to discuss this they were quite rude also on the last day of our stay we got lost an ended up at the euro star train station got a licenced cab back to the hotel an it was we had ordered a cab from the hotel before this an they tried to charge us double so we tried to cancel an get our own cab an they tried to tell us this wasn t allowed as they had already booked also was quite uncomfortable with single beds pushed together with single covers so wasn t romantic
