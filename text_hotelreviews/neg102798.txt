there are no daybeds in the spa only stone hard bench against the wall no comfort there the restaurant breakfast room is very outdated and needs an upgrade rather sooner than later for a location like this and probably a booking all year round they should invest in better comfort and style the chairs in the breakfast room are just terrible the elevators also need an upgrade
