we felt like all the photo s didn t depict the hotel very well we saw photo s that were really of another one of their locations in paris and not the rivoli location the time of year and the room we stayed in contributed to a very warm stay for us for the price that we paid we hoped for a more modern air conditioning system they had a floor model that needed ice added to it each day in order to acquire some level of cooler tolerance it was still very warm and made for a few restless nights sleep i don t know if it was just our room or similar experiences from other guests but it was not pleasant
