the staff in the spa was the rudest person i have ever dealt with in my life she should not be working in customer service the staff at the hotel bar were also rude they pretty much ignored me overall the hotel was fine however the awful experience i had with a few of the staff members was horrible as a solo traveller i didn t feel comfortable at all it was not a nice way to start a holiday i will never stay at this hotel again
