the staff was bad and agressive the suite is under the the standard noit clean need maintenance and repair for bathrooms although i had confirmation on room and price they obliged me to upgrade and they took euro per night extra and for those reason i cancelled my reservation for the remaining week and moved to another hotel so bad experience with this hotel and i dont recommended at all by same price and less you can enjoy the hotels in changs elizee
