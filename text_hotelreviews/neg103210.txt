website description close to vavin metro station would have been more helpful than citing its closeness to paris montparnesse we walked with of luggage from paris montparnesse whereas otherwise we would have bought metro tickets to vavin or paid for a taxi it was euro for the return trip from the hotel to paris montaparnesse the next morning mostly what we didn t like was that we booked to stay here for two nights friday sunday but only ended up staying for one sunday because the hotel was expecting us saturday and sunday not what our booking com reservation said and was booked out on arrival so we ended up staying in a different mercure bercy rather later than expected and having to get up earlier for an early morning trip to rennes we had to share a double bed instead of having a twin room because the mercure bercy had only one room left
