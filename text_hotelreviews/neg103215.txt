the shower screen was a bit small and there was a slight leak so the bathroom floor got quite wet when we used the shower the room service menu has a very limited selection we would have liked to order something like a sandwich when we arrived but it was not available the breakfast area was a little small when everyone was trying to serve themselves at the buffet on our last day we noticed that one man had to take his breakfast out to the bar area as there was no space in the breakfast room
