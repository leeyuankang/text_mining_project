the only negative point was the shower basin which was blocked by the water maybe on my chance other than that all other things were quite fine couple of mins to arc de triumph by walking and around hotel is quiet cosy sufficiently comfortable and clean for single or couples i preferred having croissants and a coffee like many french do at on the road instead of getting breakfast of at the hotel
