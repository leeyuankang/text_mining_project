the cleaning staff accidentally threw away my tooth brush i asked the front desk for a new one and was told there wasn t one and also no information about where i could get one in the area she later placed one by my door in the morning with an apology note saying sorry she could not find it before overall quite well handed but was not so great to not be able to brush my teeth that night
