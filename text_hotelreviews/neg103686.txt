rats rats squeaking all night from somewhere around the room wash basins were clogged had to change room because the hotel owner decided to paint next door room at pm we couldn t stand the paint smell double bed was so big that only one person can sleep easily every time had to login to their hotel registration site to gain wifi access and that too deliberately of very slow speed so that customers can upgrade to faster speed even my speed was faster than hotel wifi if anyone travelling by car please avoid this place location as the parking charges near hotel are per day rating from me zero star
