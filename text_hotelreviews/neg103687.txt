my stay was a disaster i suggest the name of the hotel is be changed into simply crooks thieves i have to tell that my room was filthy and my experience became even worse after my stay a few hours after having checked out i realised that i forgot my electircal toothbrush in the bathroom of my room i called the hotel they said that they had not found anything in my room as i knew for sure that i did leave it in the bathroom i called back a few hours later then they said that they would check with the cleaning person again one day later i called them and they said that indeed the cleaning person had found the electrical toothbrush but had thrown it away i asked why they first said they found nothing and lateron got another anwer i did not get an explanation furthermore they said that this was something between me and the cleaning person who i don t know i even don t know whether the person is a man or a woman and that the hotel has nothing to do with it i proposed that the hotel would give my electrical toothbrush back or a compensation of euro after a month i still got no answer if i try to call them they even don t pick up the phone anymore congratulations simply crooks thieves
