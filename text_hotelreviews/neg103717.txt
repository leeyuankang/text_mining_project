very small room with tiny windows that you can barely see out of kind of like being in a basement i found some bugs in our room too the daily housekeeping was mediocre they left us without toilet paper once and put two spoons we had used and left on the counter away in the drawer without washing them the room was way too small for what it was could barely use the kitchenette and the two of us were tripping over each other
