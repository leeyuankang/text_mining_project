the location was a little out of the way and would have been hard to find if we hadn t had gps on our phones luckily it wasn t a problem for us but i would suggest looking up directions beforehand if you don t have maps on your phone that being said the hotel is only a minute walk from west kensington underground and easy to find your way after you ve been there once
