the staff was not very friendly on many instances we asked over email if we could accommodate a year old in a room total people and they said no problem while we were checking in they said it will cost euros extra per night after we argued this was not explained over email they waived the charge but it s not a good start they did put a hold on my credit card but hoping they won t actually charge it they promised not to charge it before my approval the a c wasn t working and all of the details on the control were in french the guy who came to fix it didn t do it with a smile you have to fix it anyways pls do it with a smile while checking out we wanted to store our luggage for hours the guy did not help us with the luggage which is fine he made a grumpy face when i said i left something in the storage and when we wanted to collect our luggage they wouldn t let us collect it ourselves it took them way longer to find our luggage because we had to put it in the storage i think there are much better hotels in the neighborhood our friends stayed in hotels they cost less and were decent booking com gave us free and discounted tours in paris which didn t make me feel bad for spending so much money on hotel rooms that were not worth it
