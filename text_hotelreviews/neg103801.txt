the location itself cannot be helped but having a smoking area would certainly make the stay more comfortable the only problem we had whilst being there was having to go out front in the morning for a cigerette to be harrassed by a still drunk stag nighter or homeless man it isn t much of a problem but is definately not pleasant when you havn t even put your lenses in yet its location might disuade family holidayers but for young couples like us travelling friends business people or indeed people enjoyying pigalle itself it is certainly worth it for the price we were given
