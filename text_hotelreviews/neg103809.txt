after booking with booking com they sent an email with forms to fill for checking in the second room i booked rooms i replied that the amount is paid and we will fill all required forms after we get there especially the payment was done on my credit card and i was the first to arrive they still insisted on sending the form again and again that others will not be able to check in without this form i thought booking with booking com was easy and hassle free but the hotel doesn t make it easy while checking out half of us left early the other half were charged again for coffee which was already paid for when my friends tried to explain that we had paid for the coffee the staff s reply was you were not there so you don t know very unfriendly and they should learn some basics of handling customers
