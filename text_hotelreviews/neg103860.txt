i probably got the smallest room in the entire hotel advertised were the real room felt like like a maidens room in a classic house on one side there was a sloping wall from the roof it felt quite tiny temperature in there was very hot because it was on the last floor on my departure day a staff member approached in my room in the morning just to check drinks in the mini bar strange i didn t feel very welcome in this hotel
