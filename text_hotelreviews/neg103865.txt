bathroom sink rather old and narrow with no catch in the sink shower was more modern and sufficient several flights up to room without a lift although a porter was available to help with baggage wifi access was good and complementary as part of the booking but required a new log in every for each device breakfast not included in room rate which is a bit pricier than other hotels along gower street another potential drawback was the terms conditions of booking which did not permit a refund for cancellation or change post booking luckily we did not have any changes and arrived in time from a longhaul but it could have been a concern
