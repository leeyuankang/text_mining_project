this is probably the worst hotel i have ever stayed at it is classified as stars when even would be generous the entire hotel is outdated dirty and rickety the walls doors and windows look like they have not been painted or even cleaned in months the carpets are worn and stained and the floors creak the a c is noisy even after it is turned off the staff are inefficient not very knowledgeable and unfriendly the front desk is a single clerk surrounded by many hotel guests waiting for attention no service attitude sour faced arguing nickeling and diming you on every little thing here is an example of their warped logic i had reserved a suite which was a larger than normal room i had requested in advance to have a quiet room not facing the main gower st that the hotel is on to which i had received an email reply saying that all the suites where facing the main road but were completely noise proof with double glazed windows upon check in i realized that indeed the suites were facing the road but the double glazed windows did a poor job in keeping the traffic noise out this was proven after the first night in which i got no sleep because of the traffic roaring by all night when i complained the next morning and asked to move to a room not facing the street i was told that i could downgrade to a significantly smaller room but the hotel did not usually reduce the price accordingly when i argued the point i was done a favor of reducing the price by usd from usd to usd whereas according to the prices on booking com the difference should have been close to usd when i protested i was told that by hotel policy i should really have been charged the walk in rate for the downgraded room which was close to usd after spending more than mins on this futile discussion i gave up
