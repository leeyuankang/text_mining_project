one of the receptionists wasn t very helpful with the checking out process part of my stay they stated couple of times that i had to pay the full cost amount for my stay despite the fact i ve already paid in full on the first day with a different receptionist and i ve tried to explain this couple of times fortunately i had the receipt for this this was quite distressing as i thought they would already know from whatever they have on the computer system and or on paper file clearly this part needs some improvement as the checking out process shouldn t have to be that stressful
