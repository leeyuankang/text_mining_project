very disappointed with the room with all that equipment devices with lights attached to the wall on top of the bed that we had to sleep with not a very comfortable night the bedroom was on the top floor attic and some parts of the walls were lower not easy to walk around and of course had to walk up many steps impossible to compare with the others we stayed before
