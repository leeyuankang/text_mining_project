we were here two years ago and were told then that improvements were being made to the hotel based on our room these either weren t done or need to be done again the hotel is tired it needs a lot of work to bring it up to star standard in our bathroom the extractor wasn t working the temperature regulator on the shower was broken so water came out at a single temperature hot the minibar fridge wasn t cold we ended up throwing some food we d put in there the wifi was good in our room however there is a woefully inadequate capacity limit which means you need to get another password from reception to carry on we have stayed here four times over the last four or five years and sadly won t be here for a fifth
