room phone didn t work had to use mobile to call reception didn t have food choice and when alternative arrived it was almost cold wi fi useless paid for high speed connection which was hardly any better despite minute call to customer centre at a cost still to be discovered no shower gel nowhere in shower to hang shampoo flannel etc very difficult to close window to reduce traffic noise still charged for breakfast even though service did not start early enough for me a detail not apparent on booking com website cost of meal knocked off bill but little compensation for such a poor experience
