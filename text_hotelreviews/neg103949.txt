we stayed here before in the garden suite and that experience is why we returned it turns out the rest of the rooms or at least the room we were given was nothing like the garden suite so tiny we could turn around a tiny window we couldn t see out of and the noisy air conditioner was so loud we felt like we were in a fish tank we were so disappointed lucky we were able to change rooms for the second night but you could be the unlucky one who gets the fish tank also the hotel is a bit out of the way so hope you enjoy walking we were also not impressed with the desk the first time we were here about years ago the staff was very attentive this time hardly though the luggage porter was hard working and very nice in the end we were extremely disappointed and wished we hadn t stayed here way over priced
