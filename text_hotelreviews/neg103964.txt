i came back in the very early hours and the hotel door was locked the bell didn t work so i had to ring the hotel on my mobile phone so that someone could come to let me in it wasn t a problem at all and only a minor complaint but if my mobile phone battery had been dead i m not sure how i would have made contact with reception for someone to come and let me in
