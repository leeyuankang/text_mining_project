the staff on arrival were not friendly they didn t even smile and did not explain anything to me about the hotel such as where the bar was or that they take a deposit in case i used anything from the mini bar wifi was awful and my allowance ran out after only looking up a few things for the next day not enough milk provided with the tea coffee tray
