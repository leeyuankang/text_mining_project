check in was terrible we were early it took half hour to check in rooms were not ready understandable but when we came back it took just as long the room was cold no heat so a heater with one coaster missing was provided bathtub is not user friendly for seniors we were on the floor and had to go down a flight of stairs and the railing on the left was not useable breakfast was not included with the room other hotels we stayed breakfast the carpet was thin and the floor creaked with every step
