i specifically chose this hotel for the presence of a jacuzzi in its wellness centre as my partner loves it and it would have been a surprise for her to celebrate our anniversary unfortunately i only found out that the jacuzzi was out of order when we entered the wellness centre their website is totally misleading as it still shows a video with people enjoying the jacuzzi currently there is a partition wall between the jacuzzi area and the rest of the swimming pool we have been told by the staff working in the spa that the jacuzzi has been shut more than one year ago certainly they could have removed changed the video on their website or could have just advised of the disruption disappointing not something you d expect from such a renowned hotel chain
