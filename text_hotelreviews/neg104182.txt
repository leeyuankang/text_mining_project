we arrived the hotel at the pm and our room wasn t ready till after pm we finally checked in after hours of waiting and very slow and poor service the club room is meant to be occupied by a family of and we are here to stay for nights the closet space in the room is ridiculous not even fitting for a single room our clothes and belongings are scattered everywhere around the room for the lack of storage or closet availability the only closet available in the room is literally meters wide with no drawers or shelves our clothes are all in our luggage for the next nights in addition to the fact that the closet is taken by the safe and the mini bar service at the hotel is very slow and almost non existent room was not prepared with enough towels in the bathroom and of course we had to wait hours for extra towels to be sent to the room there is no space whatsoever for our suitcases and as i mentioned we are a family staying together for nights with a bunch of suitcases the pressure of the water in the shower is very week employees at the front desk are not cooperative in any way to try and help solve our problem the quality of the room and service is far from what we expected to see at a star hotel in the center of london we looked into checking out but unfortunately it is the holiday season and all hotels around are fully booked we are extremely dissatisfied with a very gloomy lifeless windowless very small club room in addition to very poor and far from star quality service whether by employees at the reception housekeeping or the concierge even after we finally got the room last night we had to wait for our luggage for an hour and we only got them when i went searching for them and was told they didn t know my room number to send the luggage up i hope you take my criticism to the hotel management as soon as possible
