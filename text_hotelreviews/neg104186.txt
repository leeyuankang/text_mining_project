room is small for adults breakfast buffet has poor selection and takes the staff ages to re fill wifi signal is really bad in room dining is tasteless deposit amount is ridiculous very expensive for the quality offered squeaky floors very annoying furniture outdated beware of hidden charges in your bill would not rate this hotel as a five star however i would consider staying in this hotel again just for the location and the amazing staff
