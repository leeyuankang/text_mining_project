pool rather chilly cocktail ordered was very average and when we advised we were taking it to the room the barman asked to pour it in to a different glass as they were short of cocktail glasses the glasses used to serve my spirits were well past their best now i like drinking in nice places and price is not an issue if the surroundings and service warrant it unfortunately this hotel simply did not warrant it prices were as expected though due to location however maybe someone could buy some new glasses for the bar we didn t eat at the hotel as i am a night owl and had no intention of getting up that early
