we had an emergency as our daughter developed a high grade fever and the hotel staff were completely useless inhumane rude and completely un understanding to delay the booking for two days although booking com approved it from their own rooms will never consider booking in this hotel that lacks any common sense they were just happy taking our for nothing terrible experience and highly unrecommended the duty manager called david would not even bother answering our calls he even had the audacity to suggest that we find someone to stay with our kid so we don t lose our booking as if we were going to leave a year old on their own but a year old with high grade fever would not want anyone but their mum then they asked for a doctors note if they had any common sense they would understand you do not take a kid to a gp until day of fever and imagine getting the doctors note just for a hotel booking just a complete and utter horrible experience
