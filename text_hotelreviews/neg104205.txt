we called for room service at and no answer we spoke to reception who told us to the try again which we did but by now it was past and the night menu was only the available good stitch up we felt the room was tiny and tatty and had seen better days many moon ago the bathroom was so small grubby and the shower curtain was ripped the air con blew straight on to the bed the air volume control did not worth so i had too get up times during the night to turn on and off we asked if this was a deluxe room as booked which apparently it was hate to think what the other rooms were like anyway if this is how booking com rate their hotels one needs to be more careful in the future
