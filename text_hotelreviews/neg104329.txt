when we arrived we got the information that all clubrooms were alredy occupied so we got the information that we had to wait minutes when they tried to find a room for us they offered us to visit the executive lounch as if that was a favour but we had already payed for it after one hour they found a family room for us not as fancy as a clubroom but we had to pay the same price as a club room after two days it started to come water from the ceiling outside the bathroom in the afternoon they had fix it but it was still wet on the floor we got no compensation for this our impression of the staff are negativ they could have been more service minded
