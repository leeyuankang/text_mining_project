the reception staff on check in were exceptionally rude as well as at check out the concierge seemed to be on a permanent break the room was lovely though and the facilities were fantastic it was a nice touch to have a bottle of prosseco waiting in our room for us as an anniversary gift for the money that was spent in night there i would definitely have expected more quite disappointed to be honest
