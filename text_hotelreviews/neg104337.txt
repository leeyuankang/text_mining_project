the room floor was so squeaky when one of us wake up at night to go to bathroom we all wake up because of the squeaking noise for the money they charge they should fix the wood floors not just cover them with the carpet also the breakfast was very expensive compared to what it includes per person is ridiculous do not buy the room with the breakfast you have better and cheaper choices outside the hotel
