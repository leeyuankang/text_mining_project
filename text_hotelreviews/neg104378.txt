i booked the hotel based on the mecure terminus nord website which looked really good beautiful old foyer huge breakfast room and lovely privilege room it was expensive but what i thought would be value for money given its rather swish look after we checked in we were sent to a supposed privilege room that only had a double bed and huge stains on the carpet after i complained loudly and bitterly seeking a full refund if they could not find us more suitable accommodation we were shown to a privilege room the same as the one i booked by phone and pre paid as shown on their website however the hotel is undergoing major renovations which i did not see any reference to on the hotel s own website nor was it mentioned during my phone calls to the hotel prior to my travel so no big breakfast room instead a small buffet breakfast on offer at the temporary first floor reception despite us being told that demolition reconstruction works did not begin until noon every morning at around or earlier loud banging and crashing woke us up then came the power outage we were on the fifth floor and had to negotiate the ancient stairs as the elevator was not working as a result of the power outage everyone was relocated to another mecure hotel we were taxied to mecure montemartre which was actually awful and then expected to make our way back to mecure terminus nord under our own steam after we did return to mecure terminus nord we had a further two power outages due to the renovations one with no notification no water and no elevator again after heavy rain flooded the lift well also despite wi fi supposedly being available throughout the hotel it was only very very occasionally available in our room there were issues with the pre paid accommodation me being billed on my credit card account for accommodation already paid for reception staff was hopeless
