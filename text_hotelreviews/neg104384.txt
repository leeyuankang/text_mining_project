i stayed earlier this year jan and was delighted with the room i stayed in hence i made a return visit however on this ocassion i was very disappointed with condition of the room clearly the hotel is in the process of renovation the building works did not disrupt my stay however the rate i paid for the poor condition of the room was not value for money
