on this visit there were one or two inconveniences resulting from the major construction and repair works which had been under way since march thus the usual entrance of the hotel was out of bounds and everyone had to locate the alternative way in at ground floor level a few doors further down rue de dunkerque there was a small desk inside but reception was on the first floor via a lift this lift was the only one in operation in the hotel for guests and staff alike and was understandably busy because of the works being done quite a lot of the hotel rooms were out of action these were not major problems at all and i still enjoyed my stay and will certainly use the hotel again in the future i may have missed it but there seemed to be no advance notification of this state of affairs when i made the original booking or in the subsequent emails i received as my arrival date drew near the first i knew of it was when i actually arrived at the hotel when i was tired with my train journey and looking forward to settling in keeping all this in proportion however i still thoroughly enjoyed my stay
