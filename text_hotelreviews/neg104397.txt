it was dingy dark had tatty furnishings and it looked like someone had poured bleach all over the carpet there was no hot water when i tried to fill the sink to get washed so had to boil the kettle i will certainly not be staying in this hotel again and i can t believe that it was around the same price as the mercure gare de lyon which was lovely
