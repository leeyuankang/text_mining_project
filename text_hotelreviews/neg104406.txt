the hotel was undergoing renovation so the main entrance was unavailable and there was only one lift operational which seemed a bit slow can t be helped i suppose if there is work taking place seemed more expensive than my last visit exacerbated by poor exchange rate for gbp i remember a comfortable bar lounge from an earlier visit this must have been in the closed off part of the hotel the bar this time was by the temporary reception desk and a lot less cosy a shame really however this was a nice time of year for sitting outside in one of the many bars lining the street outside so no great problem overall still worth staying here and i will return in the future
