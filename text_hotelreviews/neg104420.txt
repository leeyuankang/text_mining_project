was not aware that the hotel is undergoing major renovations for some time yet i arrived with the stylish main entry shown in the photos being closed off by high metal fencing and a note directing guest to the temporary entry this was around the corner through a narrow passage way and reception was on the floor only one lift to be used by guests and staff so could take quite a long time to move from floor to floor at busy times i feel that guests like me who booked well in advance last year should have been notified of these inconveniences and given the chance to choose elsewhere
