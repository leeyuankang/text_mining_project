my complain is about my whole experience in this hotel for start it is not a star hotel not even a star i m not kidding when i say that i ve stayed in star hotels better than this it is big a disappointment i feel i had been fooled no amenities at the bathroom old and small towels no fridge terrible shower outdated decoration no breakfast mercure should be ashamed about this hotel i talked to a person who was checking out at the same time i was and his opinion is the same when a member of the staff asked about my stay i told him it is not a star hotel and he said to me oh this is normal in paris really is it okay to lie about the number of hotel stars in paris sorry but my expectations about a star are higher than you can offer i was celebrating my wedding anniversary and my only desire was to be in an actual star room
