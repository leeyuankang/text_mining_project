a poor state of room dirty stained carpets broken furniture a decaying bathroom and door we got a small tv that hardly worked lots of bad signal which resulted in poor tv reception a grotty room on floor poor view we were very disappointed with the hotel does booking account regional managers actually visit these hotel and rooms a very different experience compared to the website pictures i did not take pictures as this would be very embarrassing to put on the web i did there stay a few times in single rooms so was ok for day night stay but very disappointed in our room for days and added to all costs a rather poor expensive choice of hotel
