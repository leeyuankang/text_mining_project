almost everything rooms smelled of smoke so offered to downgrade me when i didn t want to do that was told i had to keep the original room the next day they then agreed to move me whilst i was out for the day and they didn t do apparently they forgot despite all the notes the staff left for that to happen on checkout i then had to wait mins for a manager to complain to which didn t happen because he was too busy to talk to me and ultimately had to run out to catch the train will never stay at a mercure again useless in pretty much all respects
