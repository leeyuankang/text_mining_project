the carpets were stained and the room had paint peeling the room advertised at booking was bigger and had a desk and chair which was not the case in reality the view was the dirty back end of two other buildings the bathroom light was faulty and the replacement didn t work properly either there were no tv channels in english the complimentary water wasn t replaced on day of three and the bath mat was missed on the initial days the hotel didn t have any added facilities like a pool or sauna
