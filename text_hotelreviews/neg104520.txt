though gare due nord is very close it becomes a negative too as there is lot of crowd around homeless people african drunk people fighting against each other and post pm the fight begins which you can hear from the room too also there was constant smoke from other rooms getting inside ours overall it wasn t a very nice place for a couple to stay
