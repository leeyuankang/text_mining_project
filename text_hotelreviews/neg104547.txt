damp room that smelt bad air conditioning unit leaked i did report it but nothing was done shower was very poor and hot water was infrequent when i paid the bill after receive terrible service i even had to ask if their was any compensation for the terrible service and then the hotel reception gave the breakfast free which was an insult for having had to sleep in a smelly damp room in hindsight mi should have changed hotels after the first night
