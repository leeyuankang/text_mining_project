this is most certainly not a star hotel there are some things like the winding dated corridors and the poor sound proofing that are a consequence of an older building and can t be helped however other things can and should be updated immediately although the room was clean ie vacuumed and wiped over the carpet was badly stained in our room there was big chunks out if the skirting boards and the surfaces in the bathroom had seen better days we were told we had a quiet room at the back of the hotel well there was no road noise i guess but the room was anything but quiet poor soundproofing meant doors opening and closing and other general noises could be clearly heard but worst of all was the intermittant but frequent loud tapping kind of noise coming from i assume the heating and or water pipes some of these pipes were exposed in the corner of the room as a light sleeper who forgot her earplugs i did not get very much sleep even my usually heavy sleeping bf commented on the noise the next day by paris standards the room was not very expensive but there are basic standards of quality i expect from a name like mecure which are sorely lacking at this hotel we have stayed in a well known budget hotel chain around the corner which was far superior
