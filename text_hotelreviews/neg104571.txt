i was informed by a fellow guest to be careful staying here as her room had been broken into when i asked if anything had been stolen she told me no because her husband had been in the room at the time as a female solo traveler i was shocked and it left me uneasy for the remainder of my stay there i had originally planned to go out for the remainder of my day but instead stayed in my room i also found some of the people on the street right outside the hotel to be unsavoury characters this is a slightly tough part of town and i would not stay in this area again i have decided to stay here as i wanted to be close to the station for my flight the next morning i wish i had stayed closer to the airport my inial reason was to go out for the evening but i just felt it was not a good idea i have travelled extensivel stayed in other areas of paris and was returning from morocco so i don t think of myself as a newbie traveller but i would never stay around here unless i had no other choice
