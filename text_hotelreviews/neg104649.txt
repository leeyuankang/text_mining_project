i ve stayed here now for the time and have to say that this was my worst experience tv didn t work i ve called the frontdesk to let someone take a look at it i m still waiting when our room was cleaned there were no clean cups and towels we had a fire drill which is not bad at all only the way they communicated should be way better they hanged a little note of it in the elevator most of the people didn t know what was going on
