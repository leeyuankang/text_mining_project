we were initially given a smoking room and i have no idea how that happened however the staff made it right and put us in a really nice non smoking room on a higher floor after the downside of the location it feels like a dangerous high crime area sirens all times of the day and night we saw a theft and brawl in the middle of our dinner from inside the restaurant beside the hotel with a victim being carried out by stretcher the restaurant owners were great and very calm but it was a little unnerving for us to be clear we felt very safe in the hotel
