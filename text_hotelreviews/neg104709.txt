for a four star hotel the standard of the decor in the bedrooms and bathrooms was very worn and disappointing in my bathroom the sink was cracked and there were black patches mould or missing paint around the windows others of my party had carpets that needed cleaning and a poor standard in their bathrooms my party of had paid two months ahead for four rooms singles a double and a twin the twin and the double were the same price and more expensive than the single rooms yet the couple who had the double room had the smallest room with the same size small double bed as in the single rooms plus they had the sloping roof causing the room to feel even smaller and more uncomfortable there was an unsatisfactory response to their complaints
