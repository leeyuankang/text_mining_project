after check in went to my room to find it open with the latch on and the door had marks by the lock looking as if someone tried to pry it open went back to reception to mention it and they went up to the room with me and then informed me that the cleaner had forgotten to lock the door and that the damage to the door did not affect the door from locking all very reassuring having said that the room appeared to have been prepared correctly and unaffected by the door having left open the bathtub had black stains on it from previous repairs not dirt
