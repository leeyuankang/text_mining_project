given the end room in the corridor the room was very small not bright enough closely facing other hotels and have stinky smell absolutely uncomfortable at all returned to the concierge to request changing room but the staff keep question the reason after i expressed my feeling about the room seems not helpful at the end i was given another room facing the station which was so much better bigger brighter have street view at least the hotel is old rooms need renovation dirty and damp carpet old fashion telly not very helpful concierge staff etc didnt expect this standard for mercure branded hotels apparently over priced
