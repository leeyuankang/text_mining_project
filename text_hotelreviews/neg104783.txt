staff staff attitude what i experienced in paris i have never seen in my life experienced staff superiors heads of department managers have no idea what hospitality attitude means from my entry to the hotel which was around after a long day traveling the head receptionist working on the shift on the january hardly said a hello while he was attending another guest after a long wait he decided to call another receptionist for my check in it was done the room i was checked in was at the last floor with no proper window or balcony whatsoever ceiling window on booking the room online i had also the option of seeing the actual room i was not what i had booked nether the room nor the view also as an addition to the booking i opted for breakfast no one knew anything about it i did not bother to take it into consideration after the welcoming attitude on check in i phoned immediately the reception asking for a different room with a window and the answer from the same pleasant person was come down at reception with a tone no one should be allowed to use in such a position returning to reception he again delegated another younger receptionist said who was the only person nice and polite from all staff that works in mercure terminus nord even on his efforts of choosing another room and behaving as pleasant as possible his superior kept directing him in most unwelcoming way the second room had windows was on a lower floor and the view again did not exist as it was facing an inside yard and the opposite wing so the view was towards some staircase and other room windows the room was intensely worn out with repairing needed in the bathroom tiles walls sink lamps not functioning carpet looking too damaged and the door was not in good shape every single time i walked in the hotel and passed by the reception all members there were watching like a thief had walked in
