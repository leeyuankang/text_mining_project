we went to paris early january so it was pretty cold our room tended to be cold at nighttime you do get complimentary robes in your room so i would recommend using them to their full advantage if visiting paris in colder months and staying at this hotel take warm pjammas and bed socks to warm up quicker in the morning the room was nice and warm the hotel is great however the location does let it down we had a protest right outside gard du nord at on a saturday a lot of pick pockets tend to hang around exactly this area and work in teams so be sure to hide any expensive jewellery engagement rings etc with gloves or keep your hands in your pockets keep your bag under your jacket avoid eye contact with anyone and walk with purpose ignore anybody who speaks to you there were also a couple of fights always walk together close with your partner to avoid people walking inbetween you it is very central for moving around paris in this area which is great however there are other mercure hotels in better areas for example near sacre coure pigalle champs elyses etc where you can walk about a little more freely without the fear of so many pick pockets if your doing paris on a budget this will do without a doubt just keep your eyes and ears alert when walking around and you will be fine
