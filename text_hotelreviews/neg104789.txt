while i am a client of hotel mercure paris terminus nord i used the bar inside the hotel purchasing a coffee and a juice a member of staff called jonas told me to leave the bar if i finished my drinks i told him that i was a client of the hotel and there were empty chairs and tables in the bar and it was no point to behave like that we told me he did not care about it i found this approach very very rude
