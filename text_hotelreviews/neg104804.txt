two negative things the room was incredibly noisy because it was right next to the lift shaft i was very thankful that i had brought ear plugs with me poor customer service in the first floor bar i needed the light a little brighter to finish some work however the bar man was insistent at sticking to policy that at they changed the ambience and dimmed the light i only needed it brighter for minutes but no he put policy over customer service
