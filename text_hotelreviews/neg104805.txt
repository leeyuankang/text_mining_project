i stayed separate nights each time was charged euros on my visa debit card i was told that this was only a deposit in case of incidental expenses i have not been reimbursed the euros owed to me and frankly find this very irritating i will now have to report it to my bank for them to pursue i did speak to reception and all they kept on saying was that it was a hold however my account clearly shows transactions of euros taken from my account i really despise surprise costs at billing really poor form
