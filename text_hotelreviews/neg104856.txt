while the staff at the counter was friendly the bell hop was reasonably rude when asked any question the pictures online made the hotel seem a bit more updated but the room wasn t even close to new it was banged up at best and is in dire need of a renovation the hairdryer was a box on the wall with a nozzle the amenities were minimal and it was really worn like a time warp but not a good one
