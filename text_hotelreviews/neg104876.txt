the front desk staff were not friendly when we checked in it took almost an hour just to check in and everytime i wanted something from front desk they just kept bouncing my phone calls around the last starw was when i requested a taxi and within seconds from that call i get a call back saying the taxis were on strike and it would be better if i hailed a taxi myself outside the hotel really the front desk staff were utterly useless
