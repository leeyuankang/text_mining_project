it was just a day staying my wife chose this hotel s group due to be accostumed to staying at it in her business trips throughout brazil it is a half way to cdg airport so we decided to book there but the staff is not trustfull before booking a room i called up for the reservation sector and asked about late check out due to my wife s flight time different from mine was late tonight and she would leave the hotel at the attendant a woman answered it would be euros because the late check out would be in a weekend day saturday she completed by saying any further information i should book it first to have all the answers so i did it and after booking i called again and the conversation changed a lot she told it was euros per hour after pm and after asking to her manager she told that the room should be set free at least at pm or another daily hotel of euros would be charged at the check in serth told it would be given a tolerance until pm and after that time euros per hour would be charged but no matter what time it would be the check out it would cost euros an hour at night asking another attendant for information i was told that instead of paying any further fee for additional hours a complete daily fee would be euros possibiliting a check out until sunday i wonder how can a staff be so unprepared to give such different informations the hotel is rated as a star i really don t know how can it be possible the sink of the bathroom is too scratched the carpet is dirty and there is no fridge in the room the neighbourhood is not exactly a good place due to be right beside gare du nord it is not an appropriate place for women s staying especially those who are alone
