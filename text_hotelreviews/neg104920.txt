the room was a lot smaller than we expected as on the pictures it looks larger and contained a sofa ours didn t there was no main light within the room such a a ceiling light there s was just a stand lamp which didn t produce that much light in within the evenings the location on the hotel is quite a bit away from main landmarks etc so have to get some from of transport
