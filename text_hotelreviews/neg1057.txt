all minor issues the location of the room was good however i did expect to have both a shower and a bath in the room when we checked in we had a choice of either bath or shower not both which wasn t a massive deal there was also a note to say what was complimentary however there were a few of the items missing also in the morning three times our door was knocked for the room to be cleaned well before check out time one opened the door to come into our room while we were still in bed sleeping
