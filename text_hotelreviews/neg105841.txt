hated that there was no coffee or mugs in the room despite there being a kettle and sugar when we asked for some mugs and coffee we were told we would have to buy from the bar so we asked for tea bags they didn t have any ordinary tea eventually we got some coffee but the milk had gone off we were also given directions to the wrong bus stop which could have been disastrous if a kind lady didnt notice and send us to the right one
