the spa was very disappointing the pool was to cold the sauna didn t work and the turkish bath was far to hot ittook your breath away very hazordous no proper lighting couldn t see if you were partially sighted you would have had a problem it reminded me of somewhat seedy i think it was to give a sensual overtime but it wasn t c that impression the spa was a very hazordous area bathroom was a nightmare you had to be a cortonoist to have a shower it was very slippery the floor was dangerous when i got out bed i nearly slipped one lift didn t work and the room was sombre couldn t make tea or coffee in the room very inconvient staff were great and very helpful great they were but the concept of the hotel was designer but not at all practical and that was big factor in the stay i was concerned that i had to be aware of the hazards it s totally dysfunctional for staying anylonger than a couple of days it doesn t work for the client but works for the staff who maintain the hotel
