at first glance very modern unique design but the hotel is very small and i feel not made the most of the space and clutterd the area instead staff show some inexperience on how they deal with situations and the atmosphere is awkward sauna was closed when i wanted to use it something i really was looking forward to do and main reason i booked this hotel overall disappointing and a let down from the first look like a beautifully wrapped gift but the actual gift is not as good quality as it looks
