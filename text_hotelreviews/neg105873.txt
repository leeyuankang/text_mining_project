booked this hotel with the prospect of rooftop access according to the website on arrival told this is only for those staying in suites very disappointing lighting in bathroom inadequate if you are a female trying to apply makeup etc not wildly keen on very dark paint on bedroom walls rather gloomy but others may like gym tiny and really only suitable for one guest at a time bar was very very gloomy due to the lighting and dark coverings on windows even on the sunniest of days it was like sitting in a blackout breakfast appallingly overpriced
