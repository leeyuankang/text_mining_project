prior to arriving i emailed the hotel twice to confirm that i had booked a twin room which they replied yes however after checking into the place we found that this was not the case and the room was so small you could not actually move the beds apart or walk around the room the staff subsequently could not relocate my friend and i to another room due to the hotel being full the shower was dimly lit and with close inspection you could see mold that could easily be removed if cleaned properly under the bed looked as if it had not been cleared for the past years they could also do with spending of money on new pillows thought the copies and money notes glued to the ceiling was really tacky along with the red light in shower my colleague commented that it looked more like a room you d book by the hour than the night we both felt completely flogged off and would have changed hotels if i could have found another local hotel with a vacant room have no idea how this place got its stars
