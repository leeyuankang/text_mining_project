the district itself isn t exciting but there is a good public transport service also few parks nearby to walk the tap water isn t suitable to drink at all don t try to make a tea or coffee with it but this is london not a hotel fault the price for a night was expensive for us we usually stay at the places twice cheaper but at least we got a beautiful shelter after the hole we had to run away
