it was a little hard to regulate the room temperature at first it was more expensive that we had hoped to pay but we realize it is an exclusive hotel which was also surprising for the area we chose it because it was safe and well situated clean and well serviced and there were no viable alternatives it would be nice if such services were more affordable for people on our kind of budget
