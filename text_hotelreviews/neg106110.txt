i used booking com and applied filters for free cancellation pay on arrival breakfast included but money was taken within a few days of booking and weeks before my arrival was told upon arrival that breakfast wasn t included and that they required an extra as deposit for the room on checking out i wad informed that the deposit would only be refunded in the next working days im just incredulous at this
