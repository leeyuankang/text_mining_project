there was no air conditioning in the lobby area which made it rather uncomfortable this might be a temporary situation but the lobby was very muggy and warm our room had ants on the desk which we mentioned to the staff we believe they did spray for ants but it can take a couple of attempts to ensure all the ants are gone but the hotel was definitely clean and neat and everything else was perfect
