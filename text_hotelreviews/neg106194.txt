we arrived about but had to wait until after to check in even though they were knocking on the door the next morning before check out when we checked out the next day we asked to pay for our breakfasts and georges checked and when he handed us our bill the breakfasts were added on then taken off again we only had to pay the city tax however when we returned for our luggage later in the afternoon the assistant manageress said we hadn t paid for breakfasts with various excuses for georges and it will be euros please after a scene the hotel manager said he would not charge for them after all apparently georges had only been there a week and overstepped his mark in waiving the breakfasts charge but that is between him and the hotel
