i booked a junior suite but room was just a room with a sofa bed more resembling a family room and in need of renovation it was nothing like the nice pictures the double bed was actually two single beds pushed together which kept moving apart with the smallest of movements so i needed fished off the floor out from the gap in the middle during the early hours not what you want on a romantic weekend away the bathroom was badly in need of renovation too with a very strange narrow bath and shower setup not the nice big tub in the pictures the sort of room you don t want to come back to after a nice night out i m sorry to say
