the room we were in was okay it didn t live up to the expectations in the pictures and for for two nights we expected a high class star establishment the bathroom looked like it had just had the door repaired from being kicked in there were broken corners on the wall and scuffs everywhere needed a severe refurb we booked a classic suite but the sitting area was more like a tiny spare room with a sofa bed the seats were worn and the floor had dodgy marks on it other than that it was comfortable but i d not pay that sort of money again for the price there are better hotels close by with nicer decor for the same price
