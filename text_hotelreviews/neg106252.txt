the only negative i can mention about this hotel is that at this time of the year the heating system was not on and the room was quite chilly especially considering we had a toddler with us could not wash my daughter as the room was too cold and she did in fact get a cough as without realising i did wash her once we asked if anything could be done and the staff offered more blankets but toddlers kick off blankets kept waking during the night to cover her up
