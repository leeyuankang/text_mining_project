well i was basically asked to prove that i was a customer of the hotel by a concierge not a problem in and of itself what i found odd is that no one else was asked although he most probably hadn t seen the other guests either and i was coming from my room was it maybe because i m black not sure but asking me whether i m sure that i am supposed to be where i am does hint towards that pity
