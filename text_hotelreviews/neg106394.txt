we arrived at the hotel it was early for check in so we told the front desk we parked our car downstairs and we will be starting our tour of the city we enjoyed the city had dinner the neighborhood then checked in the initial front desk person couldn t find our reservation then another of his colleagues tried to help him they gave me the wrong reservation even though i spelled my last name first name multiple times finally they found the actual reservation paper which was in front of them all that time there was no apologies no signs of remorse or that they made any mistakes we also made our reservation with booking com that included breakfast that was not even considered by them they wanted to charge us euros person increasing the accommodation with breakfast for almost euro this hotel is rated as a star there is nothing special about this hotel that deserves this designation this is only a star at best in the usa i only used it to secure my parking it is extremely overpriced there are several cracks in the tile floor in the bathroom black mold is present in the corner of the outside of the bathtub
