if you are not driving or attending an event locally then i would not really recommend this hotel the price of the hotel was just as expensive as more central hotels so no point staying here unless the location is paramount the location is in not such a nice area of paris and i did not feel comfortable walking locally with my children especially after dark rather than nice family friendly restaurants most of the eating establishments seemed to be trashy bars so more suited for younger people without children in tow another significant negative point was the very poor wifi connectivity so slow i used my mobile phone
