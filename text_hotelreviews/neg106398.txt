during one week we were in paris brussels luxembourg cologne in star and star hotels but this one was more expensive with less quality compare to other hotels corridor of hotel looks like an old hostel and the staff seemed unhappy compare to other hotels this is my review comparing to other hotels during our stay in different countries and as they say you shouldn t expect more than that from paris it s not a star hotel
