the rooms lacked maintenance and the paint of the ceiling in the one bathroom was peeling off the wood paneling in the hotel is old and full of damage the place is far from royal the tv service has no english or portuguese even though these are mentioned in the tv guide provided by the hotel when i asked about this they were very indignant and brushed it off the house keeping staff and service staff enter the rooms without knocking this was rather irritating and bloody rude i was sleeping and they just walked into the room
