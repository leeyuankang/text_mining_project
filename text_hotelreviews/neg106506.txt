do not stay at this hotel the photos are completely misleading and it s not at all worth paying for the room we were given was completely outdated and disgusting flooring was damaged panel under sink was coming off the wall and was very dirty smell of smoke throughout corridor completely not soundproof i could hear the rooms next to me as well as above me very clearly and barely slept a wink after a very long journey view from window was of broken trellis and below balcony which has rubbish on it including a dirty spoon overall a very disappointing experience i would categorically never stay here again and would advise no one else to either
