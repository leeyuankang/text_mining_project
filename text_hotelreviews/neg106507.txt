our room was fine but the decor was worn there was nothing provided in the tiny kitchen but you could request utensils etc if you wanted our kids shared the two bedrooms and we were on the sofa bed which was fine but not ideal comfortable for longer than a weekend the staff were courteous and helpful but not overly friendly
