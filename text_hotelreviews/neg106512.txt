the property was below what the website has shown it was very poor facilities poor room equipment and certainly not stars the bed moved a lot and made a lot of noise the heater was working and would t get switched off the bathroom sometimes had no warm water only very hot burning water i was shocked to know upon arrival that there was no room service and no mini bar the door was normally locked and i couldn t open it with the room card i had to call someone from the reception each time to open the door themselves
