i didn t find my reservation as i did it the reserved apartment with fan not ac i took about hrs to check in even i arrived pm the reception employee was non cooperative and can t solve any problem the case was solved by my suggestion to give me rooms instead of the apartment but one only was with ac and the other with fan so i am totally disappointed and never tell any one about this bad hotel
