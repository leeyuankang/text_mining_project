huge ripoff buyer beware room was nothing like photos photos showed two large windows open room floor plan purchased upgraded room to exec suite yet actual size was small and all the space was in a lone unusable hallway actual room was small maybe sq ft it was cramped low headroom ducking to get through doorways the view was only visible if you climbed out of the single tiny window onto a ft wide narrow ledge staff sold museum day ticket without warning even though they knew the pompidou was closed on strike hotel desk told us by phone that they could get us tickets to a classical concert we wanted to attend we rushed back to only be told it was sold out staff did not want anyone in the lobby seating if you were not buying drinks i stay in europe frequently on business and no one could ever consider this a star hotel i have stayed at much nicer three star hotels
