the first room the mini bar was off and the room just smelt awfully of mold the mini bar was not clean and the room still looked as if you could tell someone else had been in it the staff were rude due to that we eventually moved rooms just to miss the eiffel tower lights come on why we were spending so much to stay so close they charge euro just for two coffees i would definitely not recommend the brighton to anyone
