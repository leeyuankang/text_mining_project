on booking com it is written your card will not be charged on time of booking you will pay amount now but that wasn t the case my card was charged days before arrival the day before a staff member called me telling me they are calling to confirm while my booking on booking is confirmed they said we will charge you weeks before arrival while my booking is cancel free when i finished the call they charged my card same day that was days before my dates i called and asked why but no one toke responsibility even they don t understand english very well and then the money was returned also times they blocked the amount afterwards they also kept calling are you coming which is frustrating if my booking is confirmed what is their problem if i don t show up they can charge my card i don t understand why they need to keep call and bothering me the blonde lady on the reception clearly doesn t know anything i asked about charging my card she only shock her head i don t know it is not us i show her my sms from the bank and the dates it is the brighton hotel that charged my card time she says no i don t know not us we tryed the room service one day and ordered pasta which came in a plastic plat and a plastic tray with plastic utensils it seems they brought it from a near by restaurant a to go meal which makes me wonder how many stars is this hotel over rated and over priced in my opinion
