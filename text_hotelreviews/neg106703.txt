the room was not up to the standard we would of expected for the hotel and the cost the door kept jamming the toilet seat was loose the bed wasn t correctly made the sink wasn t cleaned daily and the tea coffee sugar wasn t replenished so a little disappointing we did talk to the staff before we checked out and when we settled the bill they had only charged us for one night instead of two they were also very apologetic
