elevators did not work properly our bathroom was so interesting the curtains were so thin that you could see the other rooms and can be seen by them i got my shower the lights off i have reported that to the reception but no one was interested also be careful with your payments although my deal with booking com was not to be charged from the credit card i declared they did they apologized and paid it back but still i have lost some money because of the currency change they shouldn t have done that at the first place
