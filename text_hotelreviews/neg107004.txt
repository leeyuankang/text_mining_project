few things need improvement the bar prices were expensive as was the usual mini bar mini extortion racket when will hotels grasp the concept of reasonable mini bar rates i took my own drink for the room the rooftop bar although nice the wait times for a drink were way too long it was a young trendy atmosphere on the terrace all nice people i just felt at a little out of place we ordered room service later at night and it just didn t turn up this wasn t a problem as we fell asleep waiting but should be addressed in a hotel in this price range
