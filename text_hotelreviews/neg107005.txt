the location and the staff the front desk staff at check in was on the phone when we arrived at it we waited patiently and she was obviously annoyed at the phone call and transferred her bad mood to us after we have checked into the room we phoned the front desk to inquire a room with a tub in the bathroom the same lady at check in said she would call back but never did so we went down with our belongings and asked again for a bathroom with tub she got furious and said the hotel was fully booked wow nowadays star hotels seem to have preference for employees with bad english and bad mood
