the t v was unnecessarily complicated and when we asked for someone to come up and show us how it worked no one came we did not eat breakfast at the hotel very expensive but we did get coffee in the morning it was good but overpriced coffees were around canadian the hotel has a gym but it is very small with very little floor space to move once you have people in there it s packed while we were there the ac was not working so only the machines were available the first day and although it was completely open the next day the ac had still not been repaired we only lasted about minutes before we got too hot the staff was friendly but not particularly helpful for example we asked the concierge to look into getting wimbledon tickets for us he said he would call us the next morning and he never did we also asked the housekeeping staff for a lighter blanket for the bed and got no response
