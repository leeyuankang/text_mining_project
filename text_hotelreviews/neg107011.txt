we were in one of the more expensive rooms the montcalm club we were disappointed to find this was on the first floor with no view and quite noisy in the mornings in all other hotels in this price range we have stayed in the club rooms would be much better located the staff in the restaurant also seemed poorly trained which was disappointing given the prices two of our table of four asked for drinks and the waiter walked off without asking if anyone else wanted one the restaurant was quite empty when we were there yet we were served by about different people during the meal which felt quite amateurish
