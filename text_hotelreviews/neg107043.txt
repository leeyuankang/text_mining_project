no view from the room at all which was very disappointing very disappointed to be honest i wanted to book something special for my wife s birthday so chose this hotel based on reviews won t be doing that again and the staff service at breakfast was woeful not acceptable in any way shape or form they did not seem to care i have had better service and certainly better views i could have booked a holiday inn or premiere inn for half the price and got better service and maybe a view
