unfortunately the sheets were quite hard and starchy not as expected for a star also the staff in the aviary might need a bit more training we have a restaurant booking for lunch which was actually a surprise i had an email confirming my reservation and they could not find it even though the restaurant was empty they continued to look for the reservation and looked at my phone a no of times keeping us waiting about minutes rather then just show us to another table it was slightly unprofessional especially as we were there in london as a surprise to our friends who were due to arrive any second finally we got a table and explained it was surprise please show our friends to our table needles to say they did not manage to do that and we had to walk up to our friends other things like pouring tap water on top of our sparkling water but luckily the manager noticed this and replaced the bottle and simply saying goodbye to diners as we left the restaurant we passed about staff including the lady at the front of house and no one said anything it might be just teething as i believe its a new restaurant food location etc were all great
