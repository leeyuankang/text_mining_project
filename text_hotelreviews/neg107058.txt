i was given a room for disabled people and the sink was very low which gave me a back pain every time i needed to use it also there was no curtain doors separating the shower from the rest of the bathroom which made a huge mess every time i took a shower also there was one day that the room was not cleaned organized so i had to call them to come and do it after i came back from a long working day
