there were several technical glitches and although they were taken care of by the hotel staff super quickly it was somewhat annoying to have to come from the office late in the evening and find out something went wrong the lights and air conditioning were controlled by a digital panel which failed a couple of times another night the safe would not open another night the desk light had to be replaced and several times the keycard did not work overall i was satisfied with my stay here but not sure i would return
