with the price i paid for the breakfast was an additional i had also requested a room with a view but i guess that wasn t the case for this hotel the staff were very strange and awkward which made my experience quite uncomfortable the light function was fine but there s just too much going on and it s not as straight forward we had trouble using it at some point during our stay always malfunctioning the smart view function on the tv didn t even work which was a complete waste of time the room requested wasn t like the one shown on the picture smaller than i expected but this is fine charged extortion prices for the mini bar but that s expected was only given one robe even though they were aware that there s two people in the room overall my experience was ok the bed was comfortable and the tv is huge but needs room for improvement
