i think the breakfast prices are a bit steep the only real complaint i could have was that i had to move rooms twice due to malfunctioning locks in the room door this was an inconvenience but the hotel dealt with it well and gave me a complimentary drink and full english breakfast for both mornings so thankfully i didn t have to pay the price of the breakfast
