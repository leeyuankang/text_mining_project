spa area was not great very small and steam room not working changing room lacking benchs and privacy also signage in hotel is poor really not easy to find the spa had to ask several staff and still got lost and there was no information in room about the spa either spa staff were less helpful that other staff who were all lovely i stayed on top floor and it was a little noisy with the bar above which didn t bother me but would be a consideration if staying with children or a light sleeper
