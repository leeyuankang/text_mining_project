room service was sub par my coffee cups were clearly just rinsed with water and not clean replaced with fresh cups not all trash was taken out daily water bottles coffee etc not replaced each morning which was disappointing as this was supposed to be provided with the room my door didn t require a key to enter at first meaning anyone could waltz right in as the battery died on the door unit this is very dangerous but was remedied right away and they sent someone to stand outside my door to make sure no one entered whilst i was out the internal lock didn t work so you couldn t lock the door from the inside but they did send someone right away to fix that he had to chisel the door frame down and play with the hinges phones in the room didn t work this didn t get fixed but there was a handy mobile in the room for most problems staff were very helpful and prompt to remedy any issues house cleaning and phones excluded i didn t want to have to call reception again with yet another problem biggest issue there was an additional charge on my room of over as it hasn t gone through yet i can t comment on any resolve
