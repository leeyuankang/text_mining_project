a very long wait for our room to be ready we had to leave as we had places to be and they took well over hours to get our room ready and we were told to wait persistently once our room was indeed ready after the long wait we d wanted to just get in our room and chill out for a couple minutes get all of our stuff out and get on our way however once we got to the room our room key did not work and we had to go downstairs which was a mild inconvenience
