the room was quite small felt very much like a business hotel we also found it odd that the robes were on a high shelf in a zipped bag in the cupboard so we didn t find them until the morning it did state this in the welcome book but we didn t read this as we only arrived at the hotel late lovely toiletries but no conditioner expected luxury for the cost but it wasn t really up to that standard and no breakfast included in the hefty price
