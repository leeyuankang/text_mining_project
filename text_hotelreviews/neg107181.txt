i was charged some sort of deposit after i arrived and paid the full balance for our stay this deposit resulted in twice the amount of money our booking cost in total being taken from my bank account and taking three working days to be replaced this was a large inconvenience to me being a student who travels a lot i was left without this money heading to the netherlands less than hours later i am aware some hotels do take this precautionary measure however i was never made aware that this money would be taken upon arrival and when i asked about it as i was checking out i felt as though the issue was belittled and brushed off without it being fully explained to me this may not be an issue to others but for me it is something which would hold me back from returning despite everything else being superb
