the hotel is undergoing some sort of construction which i understand but meant that we always had to walk around to the front of the building the elevators for some reason operate independently which means that you have to press both buttons in order to call both elevators in case one is going somewhere or is stalled which is very inefficient the door locks did not work when we checked in and so we had to have someone come to the room to repair them my room service order was appallingly cold eating a burger that cold so cold that i spent half my time eating prodding it to detect any warmth is very disconcerting and made me ask management if anyone is even on staff to cook late at night to their credit they removed the room service charge and offered us complimentary breakfast for the rest of our stay a more than fair offer finally while i appreciated the hotel s attempt at using technology in new and innovative ways i must say that the missed the mark a bit first the interface on the tablet that controls the room is appalling i would never put something that ugly anywhere much less a luxury hotel second technology should make things simpler and not more difficult simple things like changing the temperature of the room became a confusing mess as the interface is poorly laid out and the panel is slow and poorly responsive
