booked three rooms one room had fruit flies all over the room but we were quickly upgraded to a junior suite for free the wall tablet in the rooms although a good concept needs to be updated you can tell a cheap tablet has been used to control the room because it lags and crashes often invest into a good tablet according to the hotel s standards the same goes for the handy phone no interconnecting rooms throughout the hotel but all rooms within very close proximity housekeeping staff can be lazy sometimes sometimes they would not vacuum the room or clean the shower properly or even leave enough soap shower gel body wash
