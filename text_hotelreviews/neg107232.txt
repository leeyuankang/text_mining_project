as i said on the like side the staff responded very well to the issues as we brought them to their attention the room was a good size but not comfortable it felt that the room was designed more for show than for comfort e g the single sitting chair we were a couple was uncomfortable the lighting was dark trying too hard to create a atmosphere and the bed was too high as well as being higher on one side than the other i assume twins made up together the staff did sort out the lopsided bed maintenance had to fix the aircon which was not working problems with the electronic pad used to control room sometimes it did not work other issues too with the room which i wont mention for brevity s sake woken up at am on saturday and sunday morning due to very noisy collection of empties from the christmas office parties held in temporary marquees on finsbury square not the hotel s fault but wouldn t recommend staying there over xmas office party time
