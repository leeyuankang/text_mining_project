got allocated a disabled room and not informed when reserving room asked for an earlier checkin which they were unaware of on arrival asked again and i was told they would ring me never received a phone call and returned at to find room was available immediately room was freezing and it took all evening for the heating system to get the room to an acceptable temperature had a surprise visit from a member of staff around in the morning check out is at have amazing tech in the room with no instructions on how to use so spent time working it out no prices for the mini bar and low stock on coffe making facilities and number of towels all in all a rubbish experience which is a real shame as the hotel has all the potential to be great
