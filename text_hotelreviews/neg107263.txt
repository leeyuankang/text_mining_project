wifi did not always connect no toilet brush unless you request it staff s english varies from almost zero to great and heating is operated from room to room which means you arrive to celsius when you get back to your room whenever when we complained they inserted an extra card and turned on the heating and that was great but this is probably a problem for the entire hotel and should be solved on that level in the future
