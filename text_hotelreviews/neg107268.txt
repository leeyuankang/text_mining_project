requested twin beds but basic twin room too small with no space between beds asked to change rooms and staff helpful but it spoilt first day as i got quite stressed the decor is very dark and masculine black wood everywhere feels very only one comfy chair in room even in the more spacious upgrade you need a degree in electronics to work out how to switch the lights air con heating etc on and off space age but impractical towel hooks were placed too high for footers and in second room although there was a towel rail it was positioned over the loo roll holder the tv wasn t working properly and they did not supply any body wash in the second room it had only been open a week or so and obviously there will be snagging but i had to clean surfaces in first room spa needs additions like benches lockers and hooks spa well appointed the staff were aware of all the niggles and i have been offered an upgrade if i stay again the staff did work very hard to rectify things
