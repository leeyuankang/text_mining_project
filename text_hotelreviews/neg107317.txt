this is a new hotel and is the worst place we have stayed hotel is actually quite good but our experience wasn t the advertised roof top bar is not open neither was the gym we could use the gym in a nearby hotel but we were given wrong directions we needed the it guy to come to our room to unlock the parent lock on the tv to watch a movie at in the afternoon breakfast order wasn t placed so we waited minutes for eggs touch pad for lights wasn t working properly whoever delivered the paper in the morning thought it was a good idea to ring the doorbell to wake us will probably be a very good place once staff know what they are doing and the misleading advertising with the roof bar and gym is fixed
