the hotel is new so the spa facilities weren t open and neither the restaurant or roof top bar which was one of the attractions that led us to stay there we unfortunately had a power cut on our floor irresponsible people in another room which reset the air conditioning unit so that didn t work for the rest of our stay however when we told staff they immediately took us to the manager who gave us our bar bill for free
