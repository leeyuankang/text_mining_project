the dust in the rooms kept sneezing and i never have allergies burnt rubber smell the scent machine in each room that kept breaking lack of sleep due to the electric wall panel the constant construction causing horrible noise when i moved rooms the upgraded room had worse views and the wall panel was right by my bed making the brightness unbearable the wall panel not working thus the engineer had to keep coming up to unlock the code so i could manage the temperature of the room oh and the gym and rooftop weren t available the whole thing was a bit disappointing if it wasn t for the kind staff i probably would ve had a fit and asked for a refund i know this hotel will be great though once complete in november bar area is very nice
