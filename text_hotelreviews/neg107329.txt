we went away for my partners birthday and we were very disappointed to discover that the spa facilities and the roof top bar were not in use even though it was advertised on the website which is why we chose this hotel there was also a fire alarm that went off at disturbing our sleep aswell as a power cut while we were in the room considering the hotel was brand new the room was very dusty on the dressing table and tv overall we were very disappointed with this hotel with the money that we spent to go here
