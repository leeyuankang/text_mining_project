housekeeping wasn t very consistent although the bed was made we always came back feeling that the room wasn t tidied up maybe it s a directive from management not to put things away although we aren t messy we did sometimes forget to put our shoes away etc as we d be in a rush to get to our destinations and it was a little disappointing to come back and everything was the way it was except for the bed and thankfully the bathroom we once forgot to turn off the do not disturb sign and i called the hotel to explain i was assured housekeeping would be sent up we got back housekeeping must have left because no one explained to them to ignore the dnd we called again turned off the dnd light and asked for the room to be made room was made but they d taken all the towels and had not replaced them
