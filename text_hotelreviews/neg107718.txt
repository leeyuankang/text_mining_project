two minor things our view was of the rooftop of an interior courtyard basically just an inner light well for the hotel but i had asked specifically for a quiet room and that location certainly delivered besides the room was so beautiful inside we just pulled the sheer curtains closed and then the blackout curtains at night secondly the lobby is heavily fragranced which my husband with allergies did not appreciate i did not care for the smell myself but that may just be my preference otherwise it was a wonderful stay
