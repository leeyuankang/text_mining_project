due to business reasons i informed the hotel that i was about to check out around or and they said only able to check out at however due to traffic in london i rushed to the hotel at to check out the staff at the reception and the cleaning staff gave me a very nasty look and implied i came too late to check out which was very unpleasant i understood the late june was a busy period for the hotel because i travelled a lot and stayed many times in the hotel and staff have always been very friendly and accommodating but the experience i had this time was not good
