recipation staff was very unwelcoming we felt it was prejudice and humiliating to my daughter many things they say to justify their actions was not true and unexcpetable even management apologies but still racisam has no place in england they do some thing stupid and humiliating and maybe racist and justified it because of security check and their location and next day they violate their own excuses by making another mistake negate their policy if their justification was true the person caused all the problem didn t even oppolgies but management did after we requested a meeting apology accepted but rating has to be fare and balanced
