it is well located if you re interested in visiting the top london tourist spots which are all about mins walk away not ideal for my visit however there is an underground station right across the hotel which was very convenient and easy to use my stay was a bit pricey but that is what you d expect from hotels in london at this time of year with almost all rooms sold out
