not really a dislike but our room was showing some wear for example caulking missing or coming out from the tile in the bathroom soiled spots on the carpet as well as unraveling of the carpet ends the shower floor was very slippery when wet perhaps some deep grooves cut into the marble would help to prevent falling also some assist bars would be helpful
