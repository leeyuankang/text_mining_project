i was really unhappy with quality of room service food i specifically didn t eat out to have some food back at the hotel and was really disappointed the burger cooked medium was charcoaled and rock solid over well done the spaghetti bolognese sauce was too dry the tomato sauce used on pizza base was more of a pasta sauce with chunks of onion and very tangy we re ordered the burger only for it to arrive in the same condition breakfast was again another disappointment i love this hotel but shocked at quality food this time round
