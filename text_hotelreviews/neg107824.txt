it s hard to get a cup of complimentary coffee in the morning or as an american to get ice in the evening the hotel should have coffee and tea readily available in the lobby fortunately there is a pret and an espresso bar next door i had to beg from the concierge room for ice and was gifted with about little cubes each night the bathroom doors are heavy sliding things and the showers leak into the bathroom minor annoyances it s still a very nice hotel
