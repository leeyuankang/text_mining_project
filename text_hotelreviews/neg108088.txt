really far away from centre but i suppose that s why it is cheaper than others and travelling about the city is all part of the experience too we stayed on a ground floor room and returned one evening to find two strangers were in the room who promptly jumped out when we walked in nothing was stolen i think we caught them just in time so it was more a strange experience than a frightening one paris is not the same as it was just years ago because of the terror threat
