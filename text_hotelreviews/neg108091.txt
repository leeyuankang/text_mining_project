the hotel was located in a rough area the first day we walked outside to get food as the hotel had no restaurant and we had stuff thrown at us we were recorded and had people shout things at us all within a few steps away from the hotel there is a metro station about minutes away from the hotel but we were unable to use it as it was too dangerous to walk we ended up using uber s to and from the hotel and even the drivers were reluncant to drive here and had a few drivers cancel on us because of this the drivers that did pick us up all told us not to stay out late and get back and stay in the hotel room really wouldn t recommend the hotel to anyone especially tourists of family s and groups of young girls the location of the hotel did ruin our trip as we couldn t stay out late because of how bad the area was meaning we were back by our hotel at every night there is meant to be a super market near by but every time we tried to find it someone would make us feel uncomfortable so we had to go back to the hotel the hotel it s self was nice the staff were okay and rooms were really nice however drivers told us this hotel is used for prostitution so really wouldn t recommend to families
