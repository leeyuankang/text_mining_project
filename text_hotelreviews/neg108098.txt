the staffs communication and the booking process i booked three nights for pax which i suppose it should be person in one room because it s a pax suite indicated on the booking com website through booking com on arrival the lady who assisted us gave us two suite room which can fit in and didn t explain further when i queried about the numbers of room that i booked she just told us that was what showed in their system and said that i only requested adjoining room we accepted what the lady said since we already there and just paid for the amount that she asked me to pay and unfortunately i didnt check through the bill statements and happily moved in to our rooms everything went smooth on the and days however we realized one of our rooms card been deactivated on the day that before checking out i went to the front counter and query but the process was very unprofessional the guy who assisted me told me that i didnt pay for the room and that s why the card had been deactivated it surprised me how can i just paid for one room instead since i settled the bill on arrival in the hotel why the lady who assisted me didn t charge the bill properly in the first place the guy asked me to bring the bill statement down and showed it to him then i realized that only one room had been charged for the last night at the end i need to settle the bill again something came into my mind maybe that s actually what i booked from booking com suite room and i just don t understand how s their process in such a big hotel company i believe it should have a very well organized operating system and well trained staffs to assist their customers to enjoy their stays with them even though this is just a minor mistake or miscommunication but it is good enough to cause unpleasant experience to the customers thank you
