the staff was very unprofessional at first too many systematic mistakes they gave us a wrong room number were we entered to a room full of guests they denied the fact that we requested an early check in even after we showed them the email they denied the collaboration between them and booking com the room they gave us was very smelly furthermore we requested a taxi from the hotel they delayed the process the overall staff was very unprofessional unlike other novotel staff in other countries
