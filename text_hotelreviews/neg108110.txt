i stayed at the novotel suites montreuil one week with my disabled boyfriend i honestly don t know how this hotel could be a stars hotel rooms are not well manteined not clean bath and shower were stained and not clean the area is very shady and sketchy not good for walking or wandering around especially for girls there is no restaurant in the hotel and is very difficult to find a good one around there is also no service whatever you need towels soap etc you need to go down to reception ask for it and get it yourself cleaning ladies would just come into the room without even knocking they did so repeatedly one morning they came in times despite we told them not to the personnel at the reception changes a lot and apart from one nice blond lady the rest of them were not helpful not kind not nice i definitely wouldn t suggest this hotel to anyone bad bad experience
