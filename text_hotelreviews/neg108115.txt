rooms could have been maintained better and would ve have been nicer many things were slightly broken in our room our toilet wouldn t flush this was fixed our bathtub would not hold water the shower head was broken and would fall off its mount etc further there is little individual climate control in the rooms since the heat was still on high we were forced to leave our windows open to cool it down which makes the rooms very noisy from nearby autoroute and morning markets
