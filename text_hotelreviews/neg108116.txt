they added on a fee of around euros when i initially paid for my room for something called city tax which is something i have never heard of and should definitely have been advertised in the price replacement items were extortionately expensive if you wanted an extra tea bag that they replaced daily anyway it cost euros for a single tea bag which is absolutely ridiculous felt like a very dangerous area too lots of homeless around and not close to any sights
