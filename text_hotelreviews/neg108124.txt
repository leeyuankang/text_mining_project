the location neighborhood was in a more commercial kind of ghetto area there was a market across the street which made it very difficult to travel in and out of the parking garage upon arrival we had some difficulty communicating and getting into the garage with the staff which was frustrating the hotel was overpriced we paid for a superior suite but the room was quite small there were also hole designs in the doors to the bathrooms which was quite weird and didn t allow for any privacy
