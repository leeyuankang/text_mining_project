we booked a non smoking room but we were placed in the pro smoking floor they changed our room after we asked in addition smoke and weed smoke was passing through doors so consistently that we could not sleep we still do not understand why we could smell weed scent also in the non smoking room the bathrooms were also stinky as if they were not used much the moquette was dirty
