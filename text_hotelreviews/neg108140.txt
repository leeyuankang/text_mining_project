the location is very bad it s in front of a big nasty flea market attached photos from my window in the floor on my arrival there was a big fight related to this flea marked which scared the people in the street and it was big that it even blocked the street for cars to pass it vanished in minutes but the experience was horrible on one night a fire alarm was triggered at it woke the whole hotel up in a horrifying way and the situation wasn t handled that good i had a terrible sleep that night and a bad day at work in the next morning
