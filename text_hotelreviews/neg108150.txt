the area is a little rough at first on the weekends a giant flea market arrives in the parking lot across from the hotel this brings a lot of peddlers with items that look suspiciously like stolen goods this threw off my liking of the area as it brought a lot of people to the area who looked up to no good the location is a bit far from all of the sights but the metro is just around the corner and with a navigo pass it is easy to get around also the workout room only had cardio machines and a pushup ladder nothing serious can go on in here unless you just want to run
