worst hotel ever if you know what s good for you and value your hard earned money you will heed this warning this hotel was dirty location was horrible right next to a freeway and a dirty flee market i think this might be where the paris ghetto is it s far from the city center airport and train stations had to make at least transfers to get to the major attractions the employees were very rude the door to the fitness room there was one thread mill inside the fitness room wasn t working there was no way to control the temperature in the room we had to open up the only working window which wasn t a great idea since our room was facing the busiest freeway in paris so we pretty much didn t sleep the bed was so uncomfortable nasty stains on the carpet and the entire room was disgusting it was so horrible that we didn t even stayed the second night even though we paid for nights i didn t even care that i lost my money the room was prepaid in the process i feared for my safety i should have taken pictures of the inside of the property but i couldn t get out there fast enough
