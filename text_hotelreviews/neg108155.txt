the room is big but looks old the furnitures the floors the hotel is not really safe either i kept my luggage in the luggage storage in the hotel and what has happened is someone broke the zip and the other zip i used locked combination key but someone could open it fortunately there is nothing valuable inside although they locked the storage they allow customers to go inside the storage without their companion sometimes also there is no concierge they just have receptionists that s all it not what you expect from star hotel
