a little disappointed with the overall standard of breakfast hot food looking tired dry a lack of tomatoes and attention in keeping the service area looking fresh and attractive i appreciate that as a professional trainer and assessor in the hospitality trade maybe a factor i would suggest that the executive chef pays some attention to ensure the standard is maintained and of a consistent standard for this element of food service provided the quality and exceptional standard of food served in the snack area the previous afternoon was superb presentation and texture and flavour of each dish was brilliant and the tall young male server paid particular attention in meeting needs of customers in a polite and courteous manner which was exceptional
