we really didn t enjoy the breakfast which was a shame as it was kindly added to our booking to enjoy the croissants were stale the eggs were cooked in a horrible buttery fat which is all you could taste so ruined the rest of the breakfast on the plate i went to use the serviette it was filthy huge coffee stains over it someone surely noticed this as it was folded round the cutlery should never have been put on the table not enough tables long wait staff didn t return with clean napkin would go elsewhere for breakfast now
