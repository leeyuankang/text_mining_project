we booked rooms with friends our friend had the room closest the the dlr no view and noisy we had a disabled room which we did not request the bathroom was not clean and very tired smelt of drains and right opposite the lift honestly i think we got the worst rooms in the hotel and it was a special weekend away we could have stayed somewhere else and paid less and got better rooms
