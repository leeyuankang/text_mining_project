the fact that an executive room was booked over six months ago yet when my partner arrived they were told that the room was unavailable because it was being decorated why did they not notify anyone to add insult they knocked just off the room rate when i checked other sites for the room they had it was cheaper then charged disgraceful way to act particularly as i had phoned the hotel on the friday morning to see if i could pay as this stay was part of a present and was told it was not possible but having given them my details not a single word to say that the room booked was not going to be available
