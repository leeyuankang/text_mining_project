my only slight dislike was that the pillows although nice and deep are way too soft for my preference which as a side sleeper meant that i needed pillows to achieve the correct height to support my head and neck the downside to this was that due to how deep yet soft and puffy the pillows are i ended up with my head deeply recessed in the pile of pillows which at times felt a little claustrophobic on the plus side though at least they felt generally comfortable and didn t make my neck ache in the great scheme of things though it was a fairly minor thing and in fairness to the hotel it s possible that if i d asked they may have been able to supply firmer pillows i don t know if that s the case though as when we arrived back at the hotel it was late and i was tired so just wanted to sleep therefore i didn t actually ask
