although check in was officially from we could not access our rooms upon arrival we opted to park the car and take a stroll around upon our return one of our rooms had been allocated to someone else they had been connecting rooms useful for our family and the new room was unacceptable as someone had been smoking profusely in it the initial response was not helpful but customer services did manage to find us a better room to move to although handled well in the end i was not happy really that the desk staff had flippantly changed our room arrangement and given us a room that no doubt everyone would complain about the cleaning staff need to ensure smoking in the room fines are put into force it rather upset the start of our weekend but was handled well by the staff in the end
