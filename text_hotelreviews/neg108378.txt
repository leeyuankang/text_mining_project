i think for a five star it could do with a more modern bathroom a few more added extras in the room and at the least sky also the gym can be a little larger and the sauna didn t work despite telling them twice at the reception the hotel is lovely and staff is good however for the price that s charged i think it can be better or at least be breakfast inclusive at that rate
