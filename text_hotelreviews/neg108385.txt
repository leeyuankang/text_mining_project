the shower in our room did not work and we did not have time to wait for someone to come and fix it before we had to leave therefore we were unable to take a shower also one of our other rooms had a faulty tv but this was rectified quickly there was a good choice of breakfast and the majority of it was excellent however i didn t like the omelettes as a powder mix was used instead of real eggs
