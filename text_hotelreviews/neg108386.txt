i personally wouldn t rate the hotel as star star is more appropriate the location is good but there is a restricted service at west india quay and so canary wharf is the more viable stop the room decor is a bit dated looking despite it being a relatively new hotel and i would expect little extras like a bathrobe and slippers at a star hotel and usually a pool the area around the front of the hotel and the station side is in desperate need of sprucing up the back overlooking the dock is lovely though
