this was one of the worst star experiences i ever had and i stayed in enough hotels to be able to give an objective review i stayed at the marriott for nights and not one single night could i sleep well the bed was beyond uncomfortable and by far the worst i ever experienced i complained at the reception so they added a topper on my mattress which did not help at all i could feel the springs of the mattress poking my back and the bed looked bent from how worn out the mattress was i had backache every morning in that hotel apart from the bed the room in general looked very very modest old and worn out i stayed on the floor i could hear people outside especially late at night by the elevator the shower facilities were appalling shower head unscrewing making a loud noise just appalling for the price no special amenities no cotton swabs or slippers or robe again this all would have been acceptable to me if i was paying a star price in a star hotel but it was a complete waste of my money for mwq absolutely no value for money other than the great staff and convenient location
