i altered my booking at the restaurant and i had to repeat myself over and over because the guy didn t understand me the reception staff weren t helpful what so ever taking off a debit card as security why not just take the card details the room wasn t very clean and we did not like the fact that there is no duvet cover on it s just two sheets sandwiching the duvet the tv was not very easy to use either
