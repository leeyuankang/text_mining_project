outdated bathroom d cor and design does not match the standard of the lobby and bar area or the fact that it is supposed to be a star hotel there were no bath robes to use in the room and non fluffy cheap feeling towels which again were not in keeping with the hotel rating in addition whilst waiting for my wife to improve upon perfection i wanted to watch tv and realised there was a pathetic lack of tv channels not in keeping with a modern digital tv age and clearly designed to try and get guests to pay to view which is a bit much when you pay to stay
