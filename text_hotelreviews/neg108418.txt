the heating in our room never really kicked in it said leave it for before you will notice a temperature change but we had it on for nearly an hour and it didn t really heat up saying that we were not actually cold we also couldn t find a tv guide on the tv you had to physically flick through the television channels to see what was on if there was a guide it was not at all obvious finally and not really a big deal but there was no bedside cabinet on one side of the bed there was however a small occasional table i was able to move so i could have glass of water next to me and somewhere to put my phone glasses book etc
