the staff were slow when checking in and out in my opinion they could have been a little more friendly they didn t explain to us on arrival that i had to request for a night maid to clean the room for a star hotel it should be mandatory to have a clean room and towels for the evening i wasn t asked how my stay was at the hotel when checking out and i wasn t aware i had to pay by credit card and not cash on arrival they don t accept cash on arrival only when checking out pointless to be honest
