the bed was lumpy and rather difficult to sleep on the armchair at the side of the bed was so worn and dirty on the arms that it was threadbare and had a hole in it we dare not sit in it due to the unpleasant odour eminating from it there are very few lights in the room making it rather difficult to work at the desk area which has no light the breakfast area was very chaotic with rather a trek to each for each area there appeared to only be plates available at one end of the dining room some of the waiting staff were not so eager to be of assistance whilst eating but were very eager to try and remove a half finished cup of coffee the g t bar was quite nice but some of the gins were unavailable it is not fair to advertise gins if you do not stock them a fairly common gin like silent pool should be available the decor in the hotel is looking rather tired and there are lots of cracked tiles scraped door edges and rather dirty lifts this is not a star hotel by any stretch of the imagination the hotel is definitely a star and still needs some updating to remain at that
