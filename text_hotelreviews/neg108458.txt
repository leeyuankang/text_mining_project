i had booked rooms for family friends unfortunately the shower in my room was not working it took calls and minutes for someone to come and investigate he agreed it was broken and in fairness offered to repair it it was too late by this time and i had already had to strip wash and wash my hair in the sink the manager was very understanding however it did spoil what could have been a perfect stay
