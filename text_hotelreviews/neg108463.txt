reception staff are generally unfriendly abrupt rooms are rarely ready unless you arrive in the evening and there is always a problem with the room you requested at booking i have stayed here for weekends for the past years always encounter the same issues with reception also this year upon arrival there was no gas in the kitchen so there was no hot bar food all day only salads last year no wifi available the whole weekend a hotel of this rating is supposed to eliminate all stress upon arrival instead it creates stress
