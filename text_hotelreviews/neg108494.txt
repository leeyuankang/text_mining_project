having booked this hotel because it boasts striking views of london s docklands in an unparalleled location our floor room looked out directly over the road and concrete walkway outside the decor was dated the toiletries were tiny hardly enough for one person let alone two the curtains were ink stained and the lampshade was cracked all in all a very disappointing stay
