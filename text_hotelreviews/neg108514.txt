lovely hotel and location the trip was some what spoilt by the receptionist as we left to settle the bill i was overcharged and had to question the bill it took a little time to explain why i did not need to pay for breakfast that was included i was then charged for two breakfasts it just left a bitter taste from what was a lovely stay i would recommend but check the bill on leaving
