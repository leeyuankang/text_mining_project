the lifts were somewhat erratic with a number of people going up and down a lot as their swipe cards didn t work the road in front of the main entrance to the hotel was quite scruffy and not at all appealing especially the large concrete road blocks the buffet breakfast is not what you would expect from a hotel i didn t partake in the cyclist s early breakfast and went for the normal time serving the selection wasn t great and the serving spoons etc were not kept clean and the food was lukewarm at best the selection of fruit was also very limited i ve stayed at premier inn hotels a number of times on business and their breakfast selection is wider and also better quality
