we stayed for two nights for the prudential bike ride and had our bicycles with us previous hotels in which we have stayed have allowed our bicycles into our hotel room bearing i mind bicycles are worth several thousand pounds but we were refused they arranged for a porter to carry our bikes to a secure room but in the process the porter managed to bounce it off several things steps wall with the potential of damaging it although our room was supposedly cleaned after our first night half empty coffee cups were not removed and replaced with clean cups on calling housekeeping they did not send someone within a reasonable timeframe so we went to bed only to be aroused by someone knocking on our door which we assume was housekeeping as it was very late we didn t open the door we were also very sleepy having been woken up only to be woken by the telephone ringing on a couple of occasions as this was shortly afterwards we assume this was housekeeping we couldn t work out how to answer the phone in the dark as it was more than lifting the handset the hotel took my track pump in for safekeeping whilst we were participating in the ride and then couldn t find it when we were ready to leave no one was particularly worried about trying to sort out our issues again in a timely manner the porter eventually found it after approx minutes having confessed that he didn t look properly in his cubby hole in the first place that combined with for two gins and one tonic was the end of a bad stay
