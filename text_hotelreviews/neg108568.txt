our room was at the back of the building and i had difficulties sleeping due to the docklands railway nearby but my daughter had no problems at all however the customer services manager has made a note so that we wont be put in those rooms when we return and she was genuinely concerned i hadn t raised the issue the first night but i thought i would get used to it
