i was expecting far more from the room for the star rating of the hotel it could have easily been a decent star the room was looking tired and basic not what i was expecting at all also the little things such as cleaners forgot to replace bottle of water from previous guests and our towels didn t get changed only little things but for the price i paid and star rating i was expecting luxury but it really wasn t up to standard
