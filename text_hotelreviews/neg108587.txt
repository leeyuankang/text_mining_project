breakfast was ok good mix of english and continental food however dinner wasn t up to the standard i have ordered a medium rare filet steak the steak came burned all over literally was black and crispy on top of that the lettuce in the salad was probably cut ages before serving as the edges of it were already brown the room was as well a bit old fashion
