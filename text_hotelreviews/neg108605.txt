the staff could of been nore personable weve stayed in hotel at a lower cost with breakfast and there cooked breakfast was of a better quality for example had a choice of streaky bacon smoked and unsmoked also i prefer crispy bacon the eggs made to order were flavourless and watery and scrambled egg was like watery mash potato due to location can be very costly to stay in the area they should make it clearler that thy make pancakes and other breakfasts to order as we were not aware of this until after
