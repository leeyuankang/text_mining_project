i live in london so seldom stay in london hotels i know they are expensive but i had at least expected them to be good this is supposed to be a star hotel i do not know why it has no swimming pool the bathroom was smaller than my bathroom at home and had a plastic shower curtain this is my review on booking com not at any of the other hotels have i encountered a shower curtain they also charge per day for wifi in the room if we all complained they would stop doing that it is outrageous plus they take a deposit on arrival which they then don t pay back for days i am fortunate that i won t have to stay in a london hotel again and can instead stay in much better value much nicer hotels in paris milan brussels berlin geneva or any other location where tourists are not ripped off to this extent i suggest you do too if you can
