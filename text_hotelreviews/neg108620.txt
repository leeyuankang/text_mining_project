unfortunately there was miscommunication between reception staff and breakfast staff all guests were told breakfast was til however when we went down for breakfast at just after the kitchen staff were cleaning away stuff no croissants etc they realised the error when other guest arrived after expecting to see a full continental buffet missed the continental pastries but the cooked breakfast certainly made up for it
