usual high london bar prices probably to be expected but very slow bar service took minutes to bring us simple drinks as a result we removed service charge room adjacent to dlr route so regular noise from this but luckily we sleep well so not a major issue for us a room overlooking the quay would be quieter which we had on previous visit
