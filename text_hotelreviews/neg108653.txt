when i booked the room i requested a quiet area floor so they gave us a room with an interconnecting door and we could hear the group of girls in there at and next to the dlr track which woke us up at then as my husband came out of the bathroom a panel fell from the ceiling luckily it didn t hit him but it was metal and had sharp edges it could have injured someone if they d been underneath it the other issue was breakfast because the hotel was full the queue was so long they even extended breakfast time to midday but that didn t help as everyone wanted to dine at the same time also some of the food wasn t being replenished quick enough to cope with demand
