as a young family we had to came back to the hotel room early and were quite disappointed as we wanted to experience a couple of london s restaurants but had to put the children to bed so chose to stay in and order a variety of things from a couple of nearby restaurants we called down to room service to ask if they could bring us up some cutlery and plates pretty simple but they failed to do so after saying they would i m glad we didn t wait for them because i would have been annoyed if our food had turned cold as well apart from that the staff were very friendly and accommodating to our little ones giving my two year old lots of attention and treating her to a little cup of fruit punch it was very sweet
