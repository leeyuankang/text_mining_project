need to put more milk and tea bags in the room but i find that problem during most of my stays in hotels the room was clean but there was a couple of hairs in the bath probably from the cleaner i didn t make a fuss and just washed them away you could tell the room was spotless everywhere else and it was just a mistake the bath had been cleaned
