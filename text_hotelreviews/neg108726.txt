the check in clerk was very abrupt and did not fully explain that he was taking per room for rooms as a security deposit which was something i had no prior knowledge of which could have affected me if i did not have this available on my card also we requested high rooms but were told on our booking we could only have low rooms we did feel slightly like class guests as we had not booked direct
