we were given a disabled room as an option either that or a room that overlooked the train line took the disabled room option and it was okay however i thought it would be a nicer room with the amount paid for it the room was large although we couldn t open the windows which made the room a little stuffy the air con wasn t great and the charges for the mini bar were huge as there were two guests two bottles of water would have been better than one as that was quickly drank due to it being stuffy
