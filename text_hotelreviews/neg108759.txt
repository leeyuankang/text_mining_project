the manhattan grill poor choice and expensive salmon was yes one fillet no veg or anything else just a fillet on an otherwise bare white plate if you eat the salmon from the room service menu at least you get some potato on the side and pay less the rest of the menu was essentially burgers and ribs and little else really the restaurant used to be ok but from now on we ll go out to eat breakfast can be found locally for a lot less too
