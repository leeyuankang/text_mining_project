poor bathroom equipment there was only one bar of soap and one shampoo for people we were palmed off with a room at reception on arrival which did not meet my expectation of a superior room i was informed we might find it slightly noisy from dlr trains passing but it should not be a problem and we were not given or offered another room despite the hotel being half empty however it was noisy and suffered vibrations at every train passing on the day there was no soap or shampoo in our bathroom at p m and we had to use our own emergency on departure we were not given any compensation
