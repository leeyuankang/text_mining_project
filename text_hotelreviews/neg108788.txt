even though we booked on booking com we still paid the best part of for the one night the room was adequate but we were given a room right at the side of the dlr station so close in fact you could see every detail of the travellers in the carts and hear the carts coming and going non stop we went down for some lunch in the bar we ordered club sandwiches with chips a pint and a lemonade we given the bill before the food arrived it was expecting the food to be great quality considering it was only a sandwich and the amount we had been charged for it was a huge disappointment it was a slice and i mean a slice of turkey with salad stacked like a club sandwich but most definitely not full like you d expect a club sandwich to be after being out for the night we went back to the bar for some drinks it was absolutely packed the bar had barely any staff on not enough to accommodate the amount of guests in the bar the boxing had been on so as you can imagine with hotel being so good for getting to the it was full some of the staff i m guessing managers just stood around not helping what so ever rather telling the other members of staff rushed off there feet what to do eventually it got to much and we went up to the room and ordered room service we ordered the fish chips which wasn t to bad but definitely not worth the each and having to pay for the luxury of eating it on the bed for room service and for the tray it was delivered on im not one to write on things like this but with being disappointed with the quality i was given for the amount paid i had to say something we have recently been to newcastle for a show as well and stayed in a crowne plaza for less than half the price as this and that was absolutely amazing the nicest and fanciest hotel i have stayed in
