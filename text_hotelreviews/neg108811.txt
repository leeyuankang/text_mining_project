check in took a ridiculous amount of time i have never experienced such a long drawn out process they couldn t cope at breakfast they had an offer for breakfast but the queue for tables was ridiculous i made my booking for end of october earlier in the year for double rooms at check in i was told had double and twin bedded room when i queried saying i had requested double rooms i was told that it was just a request and couldn t be guaranteed i said that surely bookings are first come first served and my booking was made much earlier in the year and surely not all the double rooms would have been reserved at that time i was told it didn t work like that i wonder then how does it work i don t think i would stay here again in a hurry if i book a double that is what i expect and do not expect to wait for minutes for a table for people at breakfast and the check in process that really does need to be reviewed
