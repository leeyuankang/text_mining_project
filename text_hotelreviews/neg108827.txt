restaurants was humurous we booked a table and went at they sat us at a table for two by the window nice we thought til we realised the air conditioning was above us so we asked to move the table next to us also moved thereafter every person who came in was escorted to the same drafty tables and all asked to be moved also the couple next to us left without paying when waitress went to get their billed a bottle of wine disappeared caused a laugh but honestly the food didn t warrant the cost afternoon lunch served in the bar was very good value and the chips were fabulous
