we were convinced to pay an extra per room per night to upgrade at check in i m glad we did because we got free wi fi breakfast and a great room i think it is appalling that any hotel charges for wi fi in this age it is a basic necessity not a luxury and when you are paying top end room prices anyway it should come as standard not via an upgrade upon receipt of my invoice under the door on the day of departure i realised we had been charged per person per night not per room for the upgrade as agreed and we had also been charged for wi fi use even though the business centre had reconfirmed to us that we would not be charged this was all rectified without question at check out but caused an unnecessary unpleasant experience
