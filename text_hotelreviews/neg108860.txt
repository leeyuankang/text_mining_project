they automatically charged the room to the credit card used for booking i hate this booking com even provides a drop down tab to inform the hotel how you would like to pay which is obviously ignored by them the card used for the booking wasn t even in my name why would they assume that it is ok to charge it this a woefully antiquated custom and i d really expect more form a star the decor is a bit ugly i ve stayed in numerous four and three star hotels with better interiors so i m not really sure where this extra star comes from because someone says hello when you enter the main doors
