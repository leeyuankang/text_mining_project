i booked a table for two in the restaurant for on arrival i requested confirmation i was told the booking was now to accommodate others i insisted that it return to as i wanted to ensure my meal was digested before retiring for a wake up call on arrival at the restaurant we were give a more than acceptable table with the restaurant only full that is where the good story ends at we had to chase the first course a small salad and a bowl of soup it arrived minutes later main course was simply two bowls of pasta off their specifically for cyclists menu at after both table to each side of us had been given and finished their main courses off the main menu steaks and speciality dishes i had to chase staff again a few minutes later we were told it would be a couple of minutes it wasn t at i went to the open kitchen and asked when our main course would be served in a few minutes i was told approx minutes later the two bowls of pasta arrived unfortunately incorrectly i was served a meat dish which i don t eat i then took it back to the kitchen and in no uncertain terms advised them that i had now waited over and hour and a half to received a simple pasta dish which was not one selected apologies were for the hundredth time were given and i was promised immediate attention sure enough my pasta meal of ricotta and spinach pasta arrived in a perhaps minute surprise surprise it was a bowl of pasta smothered in cream with a odd touch of green in it simply disgusting in both appearance and taste it was left my whole experience lasted hours i didn t get what i had planned and as it was the last piece of the jigsaw before hopefully a good nights sleep and a hundred mile ride the following day
