in the area around the hotel there was nowhere open for breakfast at all when we asked why its because it is mainly a commuter working area so we ended up not being able to get any breakfast not the apex hotels fault may i add advice would be if you have plans near the hotel definitely book breakfast at the apex the concierge was also a little rude and unhelpful not a big issue nor is that the hotels fault
