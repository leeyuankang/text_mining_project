it was my birthday treat and my husband had asked for some champagne to be in the room on arrival as a surprise this didn t happen and they blamed the fact that we booked via booking com as the request made at time of booking doesn t get passed to the hotel the member of staff was very matter of fact about this with no apology at all we paid extra for a room with views of london this we did get however the windows were filthy
