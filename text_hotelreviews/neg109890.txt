honestly it dosnt worth to say it is star hotel as i travel a lot and always stay in star hotels and comparing to others this property absolutely dosnt worth stars the housekeeping cleaners start from early morning closing doors and opening doors aggressively that make noise at the corridor without caring that some people are still sleeping secondly they knock the door once or twice and they enter the room without permission in addition nights i am calling the room service late night and they never pickup and i end with the reception answering me and i ordered through them moreover at the day of check out at am we have received a call from the reception saying that your check out today yes i know that my check out is today but why do they call me early morning so i woke up thirsty and tried to open the fridge and it was locked because i am checking out today but still it is am we have till noon i called the housekeeping to get me some water because they didn t put the night before bottles when they cleaned the room and the housekeeping answered me with full confident we don t have water we distribute after pm is this a service we get in a star hotel finally at the girl from reception called me to say that you are checking out today and i am trying to withdraw from the card but it dosnt authorize i dont know who authorized her to take from my card and the bill was full of mistakes when i went down and reviewed my bill this is absolutely not normal for a star hotel and i dont understand why is the price for rooms are so high and the service is too bad it is not insulting to your staff but really this property should train their staff up to the standards of star hotels staff should serve the guests
