bad value for money we arrived at night only for night stay the room was in bad condition with the shower barely working it looked like starts hotel not starts i think also that they put customers who book via booking com in a very low hierarchy in getting good room i stayed in this hotel many times before and this was the first time i booked via booking com for this hotel and it was my worst experience there
