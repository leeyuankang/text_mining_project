this what i really didn t like that at first they gave us a very small room then i had to change it secondly there was a noise coming from i don t know where but i think from outside non stop noise like zzzzzzzzzzzz i really don t know how to explain it but it was too annoying and whenever we open the window we had to close it and open the ac instead thirdly i have a membership in hilton and am eligible to get water every day but honestly i had to call them every day to ask for the water actually am comparing everything with the hotels in my country we have real stars hotels like when u pay the same amount we paid in hilton we get s bigger room new furniture cleaner and much better services and i hope things could change in london s hotels as they are stars and the level of everything must be really stars
