very poorly managed hotel carpet was dirty in the lobby with stains very visible at all places my toilet seat was broken and flush didnt work properly shower didnt have much pressure in it the bed was wobbly and even my old son can push it to move with this big hotel you would at least expect a free wifi but no podium restaurant was awful flies around our food all the time uncomfortable chair to sit on while eating food the staff is untrained and the waitress kept spilling water over the table whenever she served water
