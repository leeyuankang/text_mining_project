checked in told would have breakfast in executive lounge when we went the card didn t work no one answered the bell then when we had to wait at reception to sort the cards once we finally got in no one to seat us no seats and no full breakfast we then just checked out rubbish service also said parking would let us out i had to beep loads to get someone to let us out even though i was told someone would be there waiting for us don t get me started on the dreadful rude concierge we hadn t planned to stay and so didn t have a phone charger having kids we wanted to make sure at least one phone had some charge until the morning they said they would call back then nothing waited up for their call nothing when they finally picked up a rude man answered and told me they didn t have any and he was about to call me back he then said he would check again why check again if you already claim you have then just stayed there breathing down the phone and was really rude when i asked why he bothered doing that for effect dreadful service they only get money for the location i wouldn t pay ever again for hilton so much for diamond membership avoid plenty of other nicer hotels for the money
