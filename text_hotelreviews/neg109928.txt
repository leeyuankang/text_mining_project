i have not seen a hilton with older carpeting and bathroom appliences yes everything is working but i didn t even want to shower in that bathroom i will not trust that this brandname will provide a standard to my accomodation anymore they charge your card rightaway with an additional daily extra day which i think is rude and to prevent people from checking out the next morning
