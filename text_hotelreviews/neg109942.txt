the first room on the floor had broken window there was a massive gradient of temperature between the window and the ac fan in the ceiling they called an engineer at who said the building is old i could also hear the traffic from outside i was moved to another room on the floor the king size bed was actually assembled from two single beds the balcony at the bar on the top floor was not accessible for some weird h s policy when i complained the stuff was so generous to take off from the minibar i would not recommend this hotel it s overrated
