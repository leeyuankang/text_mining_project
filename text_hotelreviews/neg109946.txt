the room we were checked into was small and cramped the view was overlooking horrible dirty buildings when i spoke to reception they were not very helpful and took a while to find us another room which was on the smoking floor and we do not smoke this has been the first time i booked through booking com so not sure if i will book again as obviously they are not i offered good rooms
