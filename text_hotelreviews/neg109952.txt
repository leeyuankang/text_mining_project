i booked for a deluxe double queen room but we a were initially located in a probably single room which was very small as i am staying to this hotel for the last years i know very well how the room i booked should look like i asked for an immediate change which they did but because it was not ready we had to wait for a half hour then we waited for our luggage and have taken too long so i asked what happened and i realized that the did not know where they were located at the end and i was really feeling awkward how this could happen in a five star hotel they were found the manager on dutie asked me how they could compensate i did not ask for anything and he offered us a drink which we did not get it not because of them but because we did not find the time
