the worst manager ever seen his name is benny v he wasn t very helpful and cooperative as he should do in his position it made me feeling like there is a kind of racism by how he is acting when i complained to my friends they said don t go to him better i like the hilton hotels specially park lane one but with this guy am not happy to stay there
