staff were t the friendliest but the main issues were the faults with the upkeep of the hotel lift would not respond to guests card keys meaning every time someone wanted to get to their room it was either waiting for a staff member to fix or take the stairs the plug in the bath would not release meaning it filled with water during a shower the result was having to stand in my partner s dirty shower water when trying to get clean for the day we asked for a new hair dryer as ours wasn t working and were met with a very unfriendly staff member who came to check ours before going back to get a replacement we also had a very early knock at our door with a staff member asking to fix our door this was the only thing we hadn t reported broken as it worked fine but the staff insisted on checking it while we were in the room
