staff reception guys are good tis you have to deal with them in reception but if you ask anything to be fixed in room like air con etc there attitude is rude as customers are not watching them there room service i asked in morning for room service and they didn t provided new towels no new soaps or shampoo cleaning was not up to any standard rooms size i was not expecting this tiny size double room that in night is you walk to toilet you will literally hit the tele its very small room extremely small for this price of room such type of room is just not right and in central london why i just don t get pillows on bed are so massive thats its good for hulk not humans restless night due to pillows in shower a tall person cannot take shower as they have a rack there which will hit your head plenty times parking is too expensive i paid per day but they have listed this not something new air conditioning is very low i asked to get it fixed and they said this is the max it was suffocating i will not be living here again its better i try hyatt or marriot as if booked early i could get near to there rate of guys try any other but not radisson blue i seriously recommend this way to type more so no one gets restless
