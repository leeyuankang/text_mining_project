the pictures on the booking were totally different from reality and we had to change our room times and saw rooms we asked for a room in the innovated floors but it seems they weren t the bathroom tub weren t clean hair the complimentary coffee we had to ask for it they don t refill it for us all the rooms must have maintenance before checking in
