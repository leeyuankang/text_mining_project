it s first time for me to express this kind of issues with radisson blu company i booked a room for days from my country using booking website with my sister in law credit card i transferred the required amount to her account and she did the reservation for me i thought the radisson blu portman will get the amount by accept the online payment like what we used to do in dubai i know it was my mistake but it is my first time in london however i arrived to the hotel and i found someone in the reception and he told me is that the registered credit card in my reservation should be with me in order to complete the payment but as i mentioned earlier i transferd the reservation amount to another person and she took care about everything in my journey and then he told me that my sister in law should call the reservation to verify her identity and complete the online payment or i need to discuss that problem with reservation department and they can accept the payment if i have a copy of that credit card then i contacted with my sister in law to send copy of her credit card to complete the online payment with reservation department also informed her that the reservation may need to contact with her to verify her identity but he also said is that i should pay at least night for the room until the problem is fix with reservation department and he ask for pounds which is more than one night price in the hotel but he said i will get it back when i fix the online payment problem with the reservation department i go to the room to call reservation department i called them and they refused to complete the online payment from booking com which is really first time for us to face that issue with booking because we thought it is similar to our previous reservations however they told us it s the hotel policy and even the copy of the credit card will not be accepted which make us check another hotels that accept the booking
