we were first allocated to an old non renovated room which looked completely different than the picture of the room we booked it had old furniture with a very outdated distasteful interior decor and smelly pillows which we had to cover in order to sleep we immediately asked to be moved to a renovated room and the staff were very understanding and helpful in doing so the renovated room looked exactly like the website pictures was very clean fresh and comfortable i do recommend this hotel but as long as they don t put you in a non renovated room
