the bar staff didn t seem to speak english didn t understand what drink was asked for had to tell them by pointing gin tonic it wasn t busy either and it just didn t look professional the bedroom door had to be banged closed each time we left our room the key card was temperamental and we always found ourselves at reception quite a lot of the time actually i did inform the housekeeper about the door and it was to be looked at the double room was rather small and rather expensive both guest lifts were out of order so i was asked to take the emergency stairs that was ok until i ran out of stairs the problem arose again this time it was the housekeeping staff i asked for directions but nobody spoke english eventually i found the service lift which took me to the floor i needed but then i couldn t get into my room my card hadn t been activated in the lift very frustrated now i persevered with a chambermaid and she let me in back down the emergency stairs again perhaps bad luck and bad timing for me
