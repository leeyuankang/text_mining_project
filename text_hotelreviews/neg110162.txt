on arrival through the entrance the revolving doors were broken so first impressions weren t great walked into reception which was lovely and we were given our key and room number we made the payment for our stay and then we were left to our own devices which was no problem we weren t told the lift requires the key to go up or down so we struggled going back and forth asking for help we thought the lift wasn t working went back to reception explained the problem and the staff member took us through the staff lift to our required floor she didn t check the problem we were having or question it we were told the maintenance guy was coming to fix the lift and then we had the same problem once we returned back to the hotel when we tried going back to our room we were then told about using the key in the lift as it was our first time at this hotel we expected a better service explaining this on arrival would of saved us a lot of hassle and first impressions would of been better the lady on reception didn t explain properly as i believe there was a language barrier we got to our room and it was business class and it was nothing special looked like an average room in the premier inn the room was absolutely freezing managed to work out where the heating was from the air conditioning controls and then it stopped working had to ring down and make them aware and they sent a maintenance guy upstairs after a while but by this time it had started working by itself absolutely not happy with the stay at this hotel definitely won t be staying here again expected more considering the room was reserved and the hotel knew what time we would be arriving we paid for the night but definitely feel it was not worth it
