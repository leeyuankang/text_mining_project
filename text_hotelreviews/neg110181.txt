i booked pay later through booking com but had half the money of my booking taken from my account a week before the stay and was released to me on the day of my stay on arrival they took the full amount plus per night that we d get back after the stay order a double room and got two single beds pushed together with different duvets on checkout they then tried to charge us for room service we hadn t ordered and then tried to charge us the hotel amount again and it wasn t until we spoke to a manager that we was told the money we gave on check out was just being held so not really sure why they needed to hold money a week before we came then hold the money for the hotel plus an extra per night seemed a bit odd to me just lucky we had an extra pounds that we didn t need that weekend and the money for them to hold a week before arrival all in all the room and the way the hotel works is rubbish just lucky they have a good location otherwise i m not sure people would stay here
