at first i was placed in a very noisy room on the second floor the windows filter very little noise from the passing cars on the main road when i complained i was given another room on the seventh floor this time however it was the air conditioning that would buzz every five minutes for twenty seconds hard to get a good nights rest in these conditions the rooms felt old and tired don t be fooled by the pictures published on their website
