four star hotel but at the bottom of the scale it s all a bit tired carpets not vacuumed in the room communal areas dreary and staff had very poor communication skills for two small bottles of water purchased at the bar i felt i was in a hotel in saudi arabia or riyadh would i stay here again no one young lady on reception was very good but that apart this hotel is not up to scratch
