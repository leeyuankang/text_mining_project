booked a business room and specifically requested the option to have two beds option was for a double and a single i arrived with my business partner to discover one double bed only to the credit of the staff they immediately brought a bed to the room but i did not expect to spend the night on a fold up camp bed when paying over was advised this option is not guaranteed also room service menu confusing very limited choice after a certain point in the evening which was not at all clear
