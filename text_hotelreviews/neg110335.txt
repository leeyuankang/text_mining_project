i requested a smoking room from november as i stood here for days for my surprise when we arrived did not get it and i had to pay around gbp more to have one to don t mention they did not accept euros to pay the stay so i had to use my debt card when we went up to our room ac was not working reported times and finally they realised ac was just blowing cold air then the day after they moved us to a junior sweet fair enough good room with finally ac working when i done the move in date evening i realised i forgot my glasses in the previous room asked for it of course nothing happened no answer given finally the day before we left i gave it a last try and asked the manager and for my surprise he found it still in the room that hk had already cleaned so i m sorry but i won t go there again and of course won t recommend it
