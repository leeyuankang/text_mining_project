where to start really we made a mistake and requested a smoking room which initially they requested pounds more per day when i refused they said they found a room for us when we got inside i was shocked by the size of it the bed was covering everything and if you would try and watch tv from the bed the wall was standing in your way bed was broken and it was impossible to sleep i have never seen such a bad quality of bed in my life the bathroom was a disaster as water was not very hot in the shower and the pressure of the shower was let s say not enough to take a shower mini bar in terms of water was emptied during the first day i gave them a call to fill it up which they did but after that day it was never filled again overall a very old hotel i think in terms of the room that i saw and what annoyed me was that our friends got a completely different room than ours i know that the manager will come and apologize for it but at the end of the day i won t get a compensation for this bad experience so i have stayed to several radisson s but this is the worst i think in terms of quality
