the property it self is starting to look rather tired especially the bathrooms the restaurant was more of a canteen feel and very noisy a dress code should also be applied we experienced people having breakfast in shorts and t shirts after a sweaty run people entering the restaurant in their pygamas and slippers i have to say that overall the hotel is not what it used to be
