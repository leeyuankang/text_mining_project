the staff were a bit robot like i felt as tho they were reading a script because they entirely lacked sincerity in wishing you a nice stay the buffet breakfast was really bad value and incredibly overpriced given the poor quality of a lot of the food choices eg very fatty cheap bacon and sausages greasy fried eggs etc etc it was incredibly disappointing for the exorbitant price it was also of a much poorer quality than in other hotels within the radisson blu chain
