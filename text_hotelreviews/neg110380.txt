there was a constant smell of air freshener that was very over powering also i had the worse nights sleep although the bed was very comfortable i was constantly woken by bin men trucks clanging etc all through the night at the back of the property not the hotels fault but just some found proof glass would have made all the difference i also heard the water machine through the night which was outside our foot in the lobby
