upon arrival the room was not ready and we had to wait an extra three hours before we could go to it the lobby bathroom was not clean with paper and what seemed like urine lying on the stall floor while waiting for our room at the bar we attempted ordering a couple drinks but had trouble communicating with the bar staff who did not know what campari was nor where to find it did not know how to simply mix it with orange juice and went through pineapple and grapefruit before actually realising neither of them were orange juice could not make a virgin mary properly and nearly served a bloody mary to someone who specifically asked for no alcohol and spoke extraordinarily broken english for employees at a luxury central london hotel furthermore the staff at the bar were openly using foul language in front of us and other guests and drinking alcohol on shift behind the bar specifically they were taking shooters prepared by a fellow bartender this was absolutely unacceptable behaviour and we were shocked to find that such a thing could even happen at what should be a professional establishment
