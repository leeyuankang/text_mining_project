i chose this hotel based on very positive experiences with radisson blu in other cities but found that the customer service at this location was so poor that it really downgraded our attempt to have a little weekend of leisure we had to wait for hours for our room even though we arrived after check in time as an explanation the receptionist told me that the reservation that i printed and handed to her was not what they had in the system we did not have a room until after pm and even then the staff were arguing on the telephone in front of us as to whether we could have the room or not we could not access the gym at all and received explanations as such as well maybe later or it s a party so we really don t know when it will open while we waited for the room we asked if we could go somewhere close by to rest and have cup of coffee and they suggested we go out to oxford street and go shopping or walk a couple of miles to covent gardens any time we asked for help with things that were supposed to be included in the hotel we received responses that made us feel like we were on mars the staff appeared untrained and unfamiliar with basic issues like restaurant recommedations a little customer service would go a long way but we had to go a long way away from this location to find any
