check in was chaotic as we had apparently arrived when most of the staff were at a meeting we were initially given an floor room but declined this when we found the lift did not go to this floor the floor room we were offered next was very small and had almost no storage space we finally were given a floor room which was better for space though it overlooked an interior flat roof which was covered with cigarette butts and other debris dropped by residents of the floors above bathroom toiletries provided appeared to be partially used by previous occupants not what you would expect of a star hotel
