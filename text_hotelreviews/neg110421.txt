i made two requests for a twin room at time of booking two weeks prior however this was not available on the day as hotel was fully booked they did offer to give us a camp bed in the room as an alternative which we accepted not ideal of course but was ok also we were on the top floor which involved walking a flight of stairs this was also ok and suspect it was a quieter room as a result a c was not working when we arrived and room was boiling however maintenance staff quickly resolved this
