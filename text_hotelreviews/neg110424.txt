chek in experience was not good we were asked to pay more for a club room as they said the room wasn t big enough to accommodate kids the ac in one of our rooms didn t work for nights we were compensated with not having to pay the upgrade charge for those nights the staff refused to let us meet a manager but once we did the manager was fantastic
