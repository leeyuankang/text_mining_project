our room was like a cubby house throughout our travels we have never stayed in such a tiny room there was nowhere to move except lie on the bed nowhere along the walls to put our cases we had to put them in front of cupboards which made it difficult to use the cupboards bathroom way too tight we understand it was the smallest room in the hotel top floor with slopping ceilings it wasn t the room size shown on the net when we booked if we had been aware of the size we would have requested to have a larger room
