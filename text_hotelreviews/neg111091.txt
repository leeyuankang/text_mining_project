do not use the hotel s airport shuttle service the hotel reception promised us the journey would take mins and advised us to leave mins earlier at in case of traffic we were on time at but driver was late by about mins then driver arranged for another pickup midway through our journey where we had to wait another mins the supposed journey became we did make it to the airport on time but we would have preferred to be early and not feel rushed which is why we woke up early in the first place you are better off taking an uber or a taxi to avoid all these delays this may be the shuttle service s fault not the hotel s but the hotel reception should manage customer expectations better
