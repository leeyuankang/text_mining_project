the breakfast is definitely not worth the euros and it s located in the dark basement of the hotel they claim that it is all organic but a stale croissant is just not acceptable in paris organic or not there is breakfast available at cafes right in front of the hotel cheaper and better room cleaning was never done but the front desk clerk admitted of their mistake the room was not reported as used to the cleaning crew those negative points will not stop me from going back to this hotel
