was a bit surprised to receive an email after our stay saying we owed gbp as we d taken the half used bottles of toiletries apparently there is a sign to say there s an additional charge if the products are taken but we honestly had not seen it anywhere during our night stay furthermore we have never been charged extra for toiletries which we assume are complimentary during a hotel stay anyway the hotel was understanding and thankfully believed it was an innocent mistake perhaps guests should be notified when checking in about the hotels toiletry policy though apart from this can t fault the stay at all
