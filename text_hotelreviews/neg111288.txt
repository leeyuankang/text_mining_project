the only negative was that upon booking i had specifically requested room for various reasons and whilst first having been told this room was available unfortunately due to unforeseen maintenance work this room wasn t available upon our arrival this in no way reflects badly against the hotel though it s just one of those things that unfortunately can happen and is just another reason not that it s needed to make sure we go back when room is available
