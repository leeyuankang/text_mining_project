the concierge was very helpful and willing but didn t always give the correct information he did however provide details of a very good bureau de change and was excellent on directions be sure to check on the internet too for information re restaurants and sightseeing we used the trip advisor reviews a lot and they were all very reliable also when we took a taxi to the airport on the way back we were told it would be a flat fate of but it was plus a call out fee of we were not told about the call out fee and in fact it was totally unnecessary to call for a cab as there were always plenty of cabs outside the hotel the area was very expensive but that s what you would expect staying in the heart of paris
