when booking i requested a quiet room and i got one right next to the lift which was very noisy all night my duvet had no duvet cover on it just a sheet the kettle and air con were broken the hotel was full of functions and weddings so you felt like you were staying in a conference centre i complained about the room and they took the cost of my breakfast off the bill but given i only had toast it wasn t really worth it i definitely wouldn t stay there again
