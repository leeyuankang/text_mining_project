the hotel was a longer walk from the facilities shops cafes etc of marylebone high st than we realised the only local facilities were at the train station at the rear the bathroom was dated at this price we expected more for our money breakfast was not included there was no fruit in our room no chocolate at turn down our receptionist was not warm or welcoming and originally could n t find our booking we were not advised of any of the hotel facilities we were only given the pool children s swim times when we asked we were not even advised that there was a rear entrance where it was easier to get a taxi so when we left through the front entrance to go out to a show that evening there was no doorman and we had to walk some way down the street to get a taxi on our return our taxi dropped us off at the rear where there was a doorman and this was clearly the more active entrance at this price we expect a much more proactive friendly helpful service from the staff we recently stayed at the marylebone hotel which had much smaller rooms and not the same wow factor of the landmark but it was more modern the staff were much more friendly and helpful and the pool was much nicer soft lighting and a more tranquil spa like experience we all thought it provided much better value for money
