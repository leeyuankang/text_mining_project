pool and all sport facilities were closed very unhappy about this as i booked hotel for pool and spa they told me this during check in it s not fair and we were extremely unhappy about this they had to contact me before we could go to another place but there was only a pool and it was not in the hotel so we didn t so easy to give a phone call and let the client know that all the hotel facilities are closed as you also pay for that
