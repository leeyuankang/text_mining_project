the spa area and pool was dirty unfortunately the attitude of the ladies at the spa desk and pool area was unfriendly and stuck up did not make us feel welcome and i have been to spas from around the world the pool and jacuzzi area was dirty and there were no robes slippers for us guests we had to go back to the room and get these before we could start our relaxation so disorganised such a shame as this was the major let down to our trip
