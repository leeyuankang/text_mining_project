first i realized that making booking through booking com is not a good choice because hotels provide the worst and lowest standard of rooms for any booking made through your website in addition to that my original booking was for twin bedroom but at the time of the check in the hotel asked me to pay additional per night if i want to get twin beds the facility in the room provided was very poor the tap in the toilet was broken and they send a man to repair it while we were out of the hotel without informing us or even putting a notice on the door that someone is on the room we are muslim coverd ladies and when we entered the toilet uncovered we were shocked and embarrassed to see a man this situation was very humiliating and not acceptable in our culture it is very bad experience as there are other issues happened to us even after they changed the room in conclusion i decided not to make any booking through your website
