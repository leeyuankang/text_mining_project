we were allocated a smoking room which we didn t know until we were in the room itself the stale smell of smoke in the room was disgusting and as there were no external windows it was made worse what surprised me was that they have a whole floor of smoking rooms and it appears that most of the family rooms are on the designated smoking floor which is utterly crazy whilst the staff were helpful to try and relocate us they couldn t as the only other family rooms were on the smoking floor for a hotel it needs a refurb the communal carpets were dirty the kitchen extract was feeding directly into the pool spa area so smelt of fried sausages
