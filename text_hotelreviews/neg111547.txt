was very disappointed with the lack of communication on usage of the leisure facilities with children children can only use the pool for thirty minutes a day on a weekend this is crazy given it sells itself as a family hotel we also found the restaurants stuffy for children it seened like the hotel cared more about the people using the restaurant from outside of the hotel than the residents of the hotel itself although the rooms were very comfortable in size the size of the beds were far too small and the mattresses were hard
