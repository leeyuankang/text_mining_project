some of the pool staff were awful unhelpful and unprofessional they simply did not seem to care about the clients one male member of staff went around the pool minutes before closing saying we are closing now the staff need to go home a us couple just walked out saying never again a german sounding couple told me they would not be returning this all suggests poor staff selection lack of proactive management and a very poor micro culture in the spa staff my family were also woken in the early hours by drunken wedding revellers
