source of room is not adequate to me p s but my mother perfect weak light in the guestroom different people have different preference so it depends it s suggested to offer usb charger outlet or a usb hub with multiple outlets most of the us brand hotels are offering it now and it won t cost the hotel a lot i guess there s only one elevator on each floor our guestroom located at the north wing while the elevator located at the south wing we need to walk almost blocks distance to the guestroom from the lift good exercise in the morning and a walking test after a day long shopping smile however we love our room because of the amazing view of marylebone station
