the only glitch was that we had requested our room to be serviced when we were clearly going out physically requesting it in person at the concierge desk we had forgotten the do not disturb sign on and think that the use of common sense on part of the staff would have been in order during the situation where one wouldn t have requested the housekeeping and then not granted access to the room needless to say the room wasn t made up by the time we returned which was frustrating and it was too late to ask them again at that point otherwise no other complaints
