we were looking forward to a real breakfast on the morning of our departure but when we arrived there was a minute wait for a table so we had to go elsewhere to eat i got the feeling that quite a few of the people eating were not residents so the hotel should either keep tables free for resident guests or make it clear on check in that a reservation for breakfast which is a complete oxymoron to me is advisable
