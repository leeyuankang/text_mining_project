booked a room for and were told it would be a sofa bed didn t expect to be as comfy as a bed but also didn t expect it to be excruciatingly uncomfortable no sleep in preparation for a long drive home also didn t notice we had no bedding for the sofa bed until we were all ready for bed at quite a late hour and then had to wait for it to be brought up a bit disappointing after a long day
