we were in the west tower and the distance between our room and the pool fitness area required two separate elevator trips and at least a minute walk in between plus we had to walk through a conference registration area definitely no walking around the hotel in your swimsuit kids younger than years have to be accompanied by someone over year old high chlorine content in the pool no hot tub pool only open so no early morning swims and the evenings are packed with families the bed closest to the door had such an obvious divot in the bed could see it when you first walked into the room as to where everyone must sit sleep when they stayed in that room hide a bed couch was comfortable enough no fan in the bathroom would have been nice to have a small refrigerator in the room
