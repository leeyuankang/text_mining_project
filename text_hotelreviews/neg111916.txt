well first i think the hotel now is over crowed that staff especially the reception lady is just vey cold although in my book i have requested for early check in she have insisted that she cannot guarantee a room until what she missed was that i have travel more than hrs on a plane before that i took my time to get into the hotel since my flight was very early arrive at heathrow at i was finally check in at although i was told some guests was already check out at i was finally check in by another person at i think she should be train to identify that guest were tired to comfort us that she will do her best to help us get an early check in instead of quoting the standardized position to say she can only assure a room at one other thing is a got a soft know at in the morning by the cleaning team asking what time am i going to check out so that they can do the room cleaning i feel your overall hospitality standard has gone down
