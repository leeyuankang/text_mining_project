the air conditioning was broken and room temp was ridiculously hot first fan brought to the room was broken then second one worked a bit repairman sent to fix air con he cleaned out the filter but not much else very poor air coming through very hot and uncomfortable night room decor was tired and worn loo seat was broken it was all a bit of a shock as we stayed there for a few days in october and the room was beautiful and comfy this was like another hotel if we go again i would insist on a room in a different part of the hotel staff are always friendly and try their best though
