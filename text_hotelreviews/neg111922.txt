i left a transparent small plastic bag on the table in my room containing small paper items such as my parking ticket in dublin airport receipts dockets etc which were removed by housekeeping and presumably dumped they should not have been touched and their removal caused me huge problems when trying to retrieve my car from the long term car park in dublin airport also other items of record which i needed to retain have been destroyed i made a complaint to reception on my departure which was met with a shoulder shrug from the girl who couldn t wait to see the back of me hilton s customer service at reception was woeful and utterly uncaring i was even charged for wifi in my room which they should have waived as a first gesture to acknowledge their cock up overall very disappointing
