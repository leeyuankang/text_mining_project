we went to the top floor bar and both my wife and daughter ordered a non alcoholic mojito when the bill came we were charged for each drink the barman said it was his managements instructions to charge the same price as if it had alcohol i subsequently complained to the hotel manager who explained that it is a sub contracted bar and not part of the hilton group he recognised that it reflected badly on the hotel and soured visitors stay at an otherwise faultless hotel hope they get rid of the bar operators
