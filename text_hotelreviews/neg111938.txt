the staff at reception could be a bit nicer i had a problem with my booking as the girl at reception was not very helpful the receptionist charged me the hilton rate and not the rate that i had booked on booking com i was charged straight away on my card despite requesting to pay with a different card and then told that i would have to wait for my refund even though this was her mistake this was eventually sorted by the manager but days later i still have not received my refund it wasn t a great start to our break away we booked a superior queen room which was basic at best i would not like to have seen the standard room the bedroom smelt of cigarettes upon arrival and had not been cleaned to he standard you d expect from a hilton hotel the beds were very hard and the shower curtain was ripped and tatty not professional looking also we stayed on the floor and there was access to open the bedroom window even a small bit so we had to have the air con on all the time
