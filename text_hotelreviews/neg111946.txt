my advice is to book a hotel that costs half the price as you will get the same standard this hotel is definitely not worth the room rates they charge where can i start we stayed in the east wing cannot rate the other wing east wing lifts dont really work especially in the morning waited minutes then got stuck then the doors wouldn t open when we reached the floor when we finally managed to exit the lift there was no stairs alternative only the fire escape which lead into the backroom of the hotel bar when reporting the problems with the lifts we were told they work fine and only busy due to many people going to breakfast no water pressure in the shower both shower and sink taps gave either boiling hot water or cold no in between the room was freezing when you entered from the hallway it was like stepping outside in winter i reported this and tried to turn it off or set to warm instead but to no avail when requesting a blanket as none were in the room i was told they would not provide us with one they offered a couple of extra sheets after i kept insisting it was too cold to sleep but never showed up not until i rang the third time after one hour threatening to go down to the reception and create a scene both the room and the bathroom were extremely outdated and shabby
