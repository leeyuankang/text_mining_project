the room we were in was a little dated in the bathroom department the toilet flush would not work well and once used it took a good minutes to fill enough to flush again the worst thing about this hotel is that there are no stairs the lifts take forever and frequently arrived already full there are floors we gave up and tried to walk down but the only stairs are fire escape ones which are obviously not supposed to be used as when you get to the bottom there is a no entry sign on the door
