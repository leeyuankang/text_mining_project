slight aggregations were the selection on offer in the executive lounge was not that extensive but sufficient the female member at the desk in the executive lounge spent most of the time on the phone talking to her friend for so long talking about things unrelated to her work i had to move in the end to get away from hearing her conversation very unprofessional i mentioned to her that the air vent above the door in my room was leaking she said she would send someone but that did not materialise probably still on the phone to her friend and couldn t get through to maintenance
