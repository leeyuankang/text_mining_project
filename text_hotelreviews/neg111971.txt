i did not like their concept of taking a deposit of pounds per day as security deposit i was shocked to know that at the time of check in i was not prepared for this kind of an additional cash outflow refundable though nevertheless i paid by cash although i could have used my credit card i did not choose to pay through credit card and wait endlessly for the refund my previous experience at another chain of hotels i did not get the caution deposit refunded next day i got the shock when i found the hotel had debited my credit card for another uk pounds as security deposit despite their holding my cash deposit i got it refunded in cash after i had to do some hard talk as it was purely their carelessness after this glitch on day i insisted they remove the credit card number from their system and thus saved myself of further debits and hard talk
