hotel only seems to air condition the lobby and business conference rooms hallways always hot room had air conditioning but hardly did the job was frequent topic of conversation in the elevators with other visitors room was clean but tired looking bathroom was clean but tired looking as well bed not very comfortable could feel the springs hotel definitely needs to invest in some form of pillow or foam mattress top concierge was friendly and tried to help with tourist questions but you can tell that their expertise lies more in the business area not leisure area
