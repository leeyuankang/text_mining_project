on our arrival the reception staff could not find our booking through booking com waited minutes and then sent away and asked to go back a little while later while they sorted it out i had to re send them a copy of my e mail booking confirmation not impressed on our last day you are allowed until o clock to check out so we went for breakfast and on return to the room the cleaner was there had moved everything of ours re made the bed changed the towels etc etc we tried to explain but she could not speak english so we had to phone down to reception and get them to speak to her not impressed
