room was disappointing as we had booked a superior family room it was smaller than the standard family room which we had stayed in before but thought the up grade to superior would give us a lovely large room but no is was not at all like the picture on the website showing a lovely large room with doubles beds and steps down to a large seating area to accommodate a sofa bed too our sofa bed was made up and you couldn t open the fridge or sit at the dressing table waited for to try and get served in the bar one evening so disappointed with the service last time we stayed there in march staff were really good and the room much bigger waiting time in the restaurant for breakfast was too long the facilities not big enough to accommodate the amount of guests staying
