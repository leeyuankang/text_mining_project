the renovations in the tower wing where we were staying were horrible just the colors the tiling everything was cheap and not of the standard i am used to from this franchise following issues with the renovated tower wing where we stayed the key cards are like trying to break into the room you have to master the speed and angle to successfully get in went down times before the staff had to teach me how to use the key cards the sink drain clogged these are supposedly brand new fitting the bathroom in general was too small no hooks for clothes and the showers had no pressure the curtains were falling apart the curtains would constantly fall down very cheap fixtures installed i believe either the contractor or the principal of the property has cut corners or not allocated enough funds for hilton standard fittings also the breakfast is not comprehensive smoked salmon waffles and pancakes all separately billed when they should be free within the buffet
