i stayed in the hotel for nights the lobby is deceptively attractive once you head up in the lifts it all deteriorates the costs were relatively high for the size and quality of the room the room is old and quite crummy carpets are dirty etc my booking com booking did not come through to the property so i arrived and there was no reservation on hand and no room available at i couldn t wait long and therefore had to access my bag in the hotel s toilet which was not a comfortable welcome then the hotel put two holds on my credit card for the full amount i alerted them to this fact but this was not immediately reversed possibly the delay is not their fault but this mistake did mean difficulty with access to money i fell in the bathroom shower due to inadequate old facilities the shower is a bath conversion and had a small no slip mat it is very slippery and no warning there is no anti slip on the floor of the bathroom and it s very easy to fall the bathrooms were dirty let s just say the stuff that should have been in the toilet was on and around the toilet on arrival
