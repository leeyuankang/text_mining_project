a wee bit farther away from the main tourist spots so we spent an extra usd a day on transport uber and black cab then if we had stayed in the city center proper due to a packed sightseeing schedule we chose to not use the underground tube but there is a station just down the street and you can easily keep those extra pounds in your pocket if you take the time to learn the routes the extra transport costs were totally worth it for my family given the large american size rooms with two ultra comfy queen beds it can be challenging to find a reasonablely priced room that works for families with kids when staying in many european cities but those gorgeous historic buildings are what makes the cities so incredible so pick your poison and enjoy each day minimal street noise allowed us to sleep like a rock after a long day of absorbing everything that london has to offer
