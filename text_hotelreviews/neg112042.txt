i have been a regular guest for years and this is the worst experience ever i may not consider staying in this hotel again looks like they give priority and more care to guests who are staying for business purpose i e conference events furniture was kinda damaged beds make sound and not comfortable toilet base make sound every time you flash house keeping clean the room only upon guest s request they don t clean good at the time of check out they charged us for using the mini bar although we just took them out to put our stuff in the fridge and we returned all items in the fridge the night before we check out the problem is that it took them mins to send someone to check the mini bar while we are checking out which made us late for the airport some staff especially at the reception are aggressive breakfast options were very bad comparing to my previous stays
