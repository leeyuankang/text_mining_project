had to wait for ages to get into the parking garage and wasn t told before booking that it was a night also i think it s disgusting in this day and age that hotels charge for wifi it was a day i would expect the hilton of all hotels to provide this free of charge i ended up hotspotting my friend the whole trip so he didn t have to pay the room was quite old with a very old mouldy smell in the bathroom and as for the view well we were probably given the worst room in the whole hotel
