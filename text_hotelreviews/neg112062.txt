the room was slightly small ac heating system slightly temperamental too hot hot water in shower also temperamental no bottled water in room this should be a given it s a very popular hotel so lots of people in the lobby lacks the exclusivity of a luxury hotel in central london but it s so well priced it s a good option in general
