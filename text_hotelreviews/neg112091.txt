when we tried to check in there wasnt a room available yet we asked the staff if we could drop off our luggage and we got referred to the luggage room at the other side of the hotel after we found the luggage room there was a sign referring us back to the counter just across reception so we had to walk back to the other end of the hotel again where we started off in the first place the communication could have been better
