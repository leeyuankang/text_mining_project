given the wrong key card for room on arrival which could have led to an embarrassing situation and more importantly a security issue as we were allowed to enter a room that was already occupied response from management was basically oh well that happens got new staff no form of compensation goodwill gesture as we lost couple of hours waiting for new room buffet breakfast dreadful cramped cold food and kids picking up food then putting it back not acceptable
