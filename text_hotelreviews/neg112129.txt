we stayed in a wing in a dire need of renovation the carpets were old and there was an unpleasant smell in the corridors noisy elevators the room looked as it has not been redecorated for years old refrigerator with some old flaking labels nothing inside apart from a box of juice left probably by previous occupants wooden tub casing coming off and cheap wifi coverage was ok but vpn connection was blocked so good for watching youtube but no use for remote work and serious business i can understand there may be rooms of different standard in a hotel but then the charges should also be adequately discounted i am especially disappointed as i am a member of hilton honours programme
