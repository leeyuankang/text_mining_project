the room we stayed in in the tower block was dark a bit shabby dark because there weren t enough lights some of the light bulbs had gone that room looks straight out onto a wall having said that we weren t there on holiday so it wasn t such a big deal also the hotel has over a thousand rooms so it s likely that because we d booked a low price option we were at the shabby end of the property we stayed on for a couple of extra days over the weekend but unfortunately the indoor pool was closed when we wanted to use it the hotel is huge impersonal but functional if you get a deal good value for the central location
