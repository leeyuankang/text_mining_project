very disappointed that we couldn t enjoy a drink after with our children and had to send them unsupervised away from us they were working in a show and didn t get back to hotel till late all they wanted to do was chill out and enjoy each others company playing board games etc but that was cut short also another reason we booked the hotel was because of the swimming pool and the children were extremely disappointed as were we when they were told they couldn t use it very disappointed with the stay this time am considering staying elsewhere in the future
