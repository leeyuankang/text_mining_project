there was a door adjoining to another room and although the people next door were just talking normally so its not their fault i could hear everything until in the morning i called reception to ask for earplugs but they didn t have any i cannot believe they have not had received complaints for this before i could here the entire conversation to be fair they did say they could try and move me but at after a long business day i couldn t stomach packing everything up small other issues the fridge had nothing in it there was not even water also the shower was very very problematic firstly the shower head didn t work and then the water wouldn t come through properly for about minutes the hotel staff made a luke warm apology excuse the pun but i didn t really think they took these problems on board and i got the feeling the hotel was just too big with too many people to cope
