the bathroom was tiny the shower head had to be held in place or it spun away from you the tv was difficult to work breakfast was cold disorganised and rubbery no offer of tea or coffee or explaination of how things worked also no clear directions of how to find my room in the west wing and was told it s a bit of a walk to your room but you have the best views in the hotel really best view as if see picture lol also the picture of the hallway was the distance from the lift to my room right at the end of the marathon length corridoor breakfast staff were the only really friendly ones also cos i used the mini bar to store some lunch for my course and two drinks they tried to charge me but didn t explain why luckily i opened the sealed envelope to see what it was all about and called reception to argue the toss it was only when i said i hadn t used anything that they admitted that it was probably cos i stored stuff in the fridge got it refunded eventually though i would not stay there again also arabic guests treated very differently than anyone else
