the hallway decoration at the floor looks mistreated and no maintenance done properly to make it look at its best no complementary water provided to regular members and only limited to silver and gold which is awkward for a star hotel the swimming pool didnt t work which was a big turn off breakfast was good but extremely limited toiletries are not refilled as expected
