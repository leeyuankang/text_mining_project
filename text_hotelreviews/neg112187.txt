the breakfast hall seemed unorganised though there were very nice staff waiting to seat us though they weren t sure which seats were free this could have been due to the sheer size of the hall customers were asking for table service on hot drinks which is usually acceptable but there weren t enough staff to cater for such a huge hall each side of the hall had a hot food cart the issue i found with this was the kitchen was on one side of the hall meaning the food on the furthest cart was not refilled as quickly as it should and had customers waiting for it to be replenished though there was a massive and very good selection of food and drinks on hand to cater for everyone this wouldn t put me off of using this hotel again as everything else was superb
