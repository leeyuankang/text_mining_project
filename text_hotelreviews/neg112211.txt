part of the hotel is old and needs renovation we were lucky that we got a renovated room but there are floors that are very old and dirty the sink in our room bathroom doesnt sink water properly and the water gets collected the bathroom needs better ventilation the room gets so humid in the morning there was no coffee machine in the room the breakfast was so poor and the type of food was limited and repeated everyday we were expecting better variety of food restaurent staff need to dress and behave better
