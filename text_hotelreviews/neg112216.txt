people staying at the hotel were smoking despite it being a non smoking floor even though the staff sent security to deal with the issue it was only solved temporarily the problem kept occurring throughout our stay at the hotel and you could smell cigarettes in you room and in the corridor there was dust on surfaces near the bed so it s not ideal for anyone with eczema or allergies tv kept flickering and did so even when you lightly tapped the cupboard the tv was on shower temperature couldn t be controlled properly the water was lukewarm for two nights straight only the first and the last night was the shower hot enough to have a comfortable shower in there were also unknown stains on the carpet floor
