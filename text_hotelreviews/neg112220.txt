we got given a keycard on arrival where there were still people and belongings in the room we could never get in a lift as they were alwats full and took about ten minutes to reach your floor but there are no stair facilities so had no choice but to wait there was also glass all down our corridor which was just left there all day and when all of our complaints were told to the manager there seemed to be no intetest and offered us a poor refund which i thought was an insult
