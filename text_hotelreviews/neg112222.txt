the service was sub standard after check in we had to find someone to help us take all of our luggage to our room they then took to bring our luggage to the room it was a huge distance between reception and the elevators of the west wing which we really didn t like as there was no easier access to our wing of the hotel the room itself was terribly outdated the bathroom horrible with no shower only a step in bath a serious update is needed especially for the price you pay we didn t expect such old finishes poor quality of toilet bath our room was double booked whilst unpacking another family opened the door walked in very poor management on the hotel s part although they apologized for this afterwards through a simple phone call there was no compensation offered which another hotel would ve gladly done if they had made a similar mistake given that the hilton is such a huge hotel with over guests this kind of mistake is unacceptable because dealing with many guests at any given time should be their specialty it felt more like the staff couldn t handle the number of guests during our stay we requested another room that had a shower rather given that my mother struggled to use a step in bath the room offered was much smaller only for people but it had a step in shower which was the only reason we agreed to move but were told we would still be charged the same price for this new room as the family room we were previously booked into this to me is unacceptable given that the room was smaller not a family room the breakfast situation was really unpleasant besides there being a very poor variety of foods drinks breakfast was served in the banquet hall because the usual restaurant which was much nicer could not accommodate so many guests
