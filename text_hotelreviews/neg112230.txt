such a bad experience here at hilton hiltonmetropolelondon we arrived past ithink they couldnt find our fully paid booking but after all the searching they finally found our room they gave us the card key we went level but unfortunately key wasnt working so i asked my eldest to go down to ask the reception whats happening since my daughter was starting to get frustrated she was so tired my eldest came back with no good news becauss they gave her a new card that is not working again so my cousin went down to talk to them and came back all happy thinking we can finally get inside our room still not working the staff gave us sets of keys already so my cousin went back to the reception again thats when my daughter got realllyyy really mad cryingggg and tried knocking and opening all doors telling us to try the other doors she wanted to get in so bad hotel staff has been telling us maybe we open it in a wrong way or blha blah how can we open it in a wrong way weve been trying all sides of the card it wanst even showing lights lights is not even working but after all the chaos after freakingggg they finally gave us a new room my child has autism she tried her best to stay calm and controlled herself and i was trying to calm her down but ithink it was too much for her neveragain not impress with service even the room and hallway so old and pricey
