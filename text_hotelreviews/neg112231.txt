our room was not made when we arrived back at from going out this was on the day when i phoned the reception they said that making up the room is a special request this was never told to us and since we didn t have a special request why was our room made up on the day i cannot believe a hotel like the hilton does not have rooms made up every day and that this is a special request but never commmunicated
