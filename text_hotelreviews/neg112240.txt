having stayed here a couple of times before i was beyond disappointed this time around the location is ideal and there is parking and leisure facilities however upon check in we were given the keys to someone else s room thankfully no one was in the room when we opened the door we then went back to reception and were given a new room there were stains all over the carpet of the new room only tv channels worked the extractor fan in the bathroom didn t work the seals on the windows were broken so the condensation meant you couldn t even see the spectacular views of the city which is factored into the room price we weren t offered any hot drinks at breakfast on both mornings of our stay we had to try and find a waiter who would respond or made the mistake of making eye contact with us otherwise they were all doing their best to ignore us and try to get on with what they were doing eventually when we did get someone s attention they brought a fabulous latte and a cold flask of hot water for a cup of tea with no milk we then had to find a jug of milk ourselves as the waiters yet again disappeared it might have been quicker to go milk a cow we resorted to taking one from another table the changing rooms in the leisure faculties left a lot to be desired in terms of cleanliness i walked into the changing room with my two year old daughter to be met with a mound of dirty used towels i would have estimated perhaps or so my daughter was more than thrilled at the sight of towel mountain but i on the other hand wasn t the humidity and stench wasn t a good combination further upon getting into the pool the floor of it appeared to have sand all over it free foot exfoliation i would expect that at a beach resort but not an indoor pool all in all not the best experience at a hilton by far and i ve stayed in many worldwide very disappointed
