the price fluctuation during my stay was very upsetting i was in london for medical treatment the room type i wanted wasn t available for my entire stay i had to book again or days at a time and every day the price changed for the same room eventually the hotel didn t have availability and i moved to another local hotel at least i was able to book there for the remainder of my stay with no problem
