the room on the floor really smelt of sewage almost like dirty water and it was so bad it make me feel sick so i asked to be moved i would not usually complain i spoke to reception and was told that i could either go to the reception desk to collect another card or wait for the concierge to come to the room but i would have to wait a half hour for the conceriege i was very tight for time as i needed to shower and change quickly for a function this is very poor and quite unbelievable with no choice i went with all my bags to the reception i was given no apology and was moved along the corridor having taken all my bags back this room also smelt i needed to get ready and go for the function so i did not mention it for this was a very poor experience not only because the room was sub standard but because the reception felt it was acceptable to tell me that i had to wait half an hour for a new room key i won t be staying again and having relayed the experience i wouldn t see my colleagues staying anymore either
