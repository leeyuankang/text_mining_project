everything was unsatisfactory and incomplete the sockets werent working we asked for a king sized double bed and were given two single beds the room was so small that we couldn t even walk properly the refrigerator was empty and switched off highly disappointed had really high expectations from hilton but it was not worth the money or anything for that matter never visiting again would not give it more than two stars
