i booked rooms a month in advance on arrival at check in they could only find room and it took about minutes to sort it out witch was stressful as we where going to a wedding and needed to leave i really thought we would not get the other room i had booked both rooms on the first floor next to each other we ended up on the and forth floor separated i was disappointed as we were all really looking forward to staying here
