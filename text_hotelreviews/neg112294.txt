we had high expectations travelling miles to the hilton metropole to be greeted at check in to be told we had to settle for a smoking room as there was no other choice and if we didn t like it we would have to down grade from a deluxe king room to a single room was a disgrace we settled in the end for the smoking room as we had very little option to do otherwise and although the views from the room where quiet impressive the actual room was no more impressive than a premier inn a massive dissappointment from start to finish
