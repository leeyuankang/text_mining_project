room we booked was not available even booking weeks ahead so got stuck in a twin smoking room that was horrid they told us to open the window the smell stayed with me all weekend and as a non smoker it ruined the trip the picture quality of the tv in room was unwatchable cables hanging out from the wall bad toiletries provided room looked like it needed a total refurbishment got a free meal in restaurant that was average but had to pay for drinks
