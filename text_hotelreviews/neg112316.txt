since we move in we asked to change the room because they give us the room that has a really bad smell we have to wait for hours for them to come and bring us to the new room moreover we ask housekeeper to clean our room but they didn t replace enough facilities suchas shampoo or towel or snacks for enough people staying in the room and this happened almost everyday while we stay at the hotel even worse sometimes housekeeper clean our room but they didnt replace anything facilities for us
