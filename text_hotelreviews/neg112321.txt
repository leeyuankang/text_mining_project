i travel regularly and stay in many hotels i was very disappointed in the state of the room not what i would have expected from the hilton as soon as you entered the room it smelt like the gents toilets which led me to look at the bathroom which was run down and smelly the bedroom was again filthy and the carpets were full of stains really disappointed
