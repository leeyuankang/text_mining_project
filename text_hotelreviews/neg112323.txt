the room was no more than a large broom cupboard not fit for a couple with the wardrobe and open you had to squeeze past the heating in room tower block was not working the mini bar was empty the tiles round the toilet were broken i have stayed in better rooms in hotels of lesser stars it is a disgrace that hilton should offer such accommodation breakfast was chaotic to say the least no defined areas for items no replenishment of plates no tablecloth on the table we were offered and the service was very poor
