didn t like the fact that although it was a o clock checkout the cleaner started knocking on our hotel room door at because she wanted to clean the room wouldn t have been so bad but we specifically chose this hotel because of the late check out time as we knew we would be having a late night the night before not good value for money either we stayed in a king size deluxe room which was nothing better than a travelodge or premier inn room so will not be staying here again
