the room was horrible and the bed was uncomfortable we were told they would call us when the room was ready so at we arrived back only to be told our room was unavailable because of maintenance we asked to speak to the manager and the receptionist went to get them only to come back with another excuse direct from the manager this made me think the manager was pretty gutless hiding out the back the decor is terrible we were shown a new room with a view like the one we originally booked and upon arrival the window had so much condensation you couldnt see a thing i advise anyone wanting a luxury stay or even a nice stay avoid this hotel i have stayed in a lot of hotel from stars and this would be the worse i have ever been in
