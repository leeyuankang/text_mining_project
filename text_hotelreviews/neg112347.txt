we requested for early check in which was not met once we reached there we were told as soon as the room was ready we would get an sms but no one from the staff contacted us until we had to make our way back to the hotel in the evening i wish i had taken down the name of the staff member at concierge but he was extremely rude to which we complained about him as well there were no complimentary water bottles kept in our room which might be considered a small thing but for a big chain like hilton it can be used as a warm welcome for their guests upon their arrival hotel is too commercial feels like you re walking in a mall
