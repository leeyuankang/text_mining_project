beds and pillows were very uncomfortable to sleep on and of very poor quality ask for king size bed but was presented with two beds pushed together bathroom was tiny and needed replacing as it was a birthday weekend away we thought hilton would be a luxury relaxing choice of stay but this hotel was certainly not this especially for the cost have stayed in much better places for a lot less money
