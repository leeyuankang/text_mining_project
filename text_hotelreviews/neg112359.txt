stayed at this hotel at the weekend for my partners birthday i d paid for an executive room which i was quite disappointed with as seemed quite small the room had clearly been a twin as there was a piece of wood where presumably a headboard had been no soft furnishing details such as cushions or bed runner no toilet paper no bath robes no mini bar lacked that sense of luxury had not been told that as we had paid for an executive room that we were entitled to use the executive lounge i only found out about this once i d returned from colleagues at work had to pay for parking in their own car park too an information welcome pack on arrival would ve been nice to have been given information about the free bar etc instead of learning of this once returned and having spent a small fortune on food and drinks would i stay again probably not
