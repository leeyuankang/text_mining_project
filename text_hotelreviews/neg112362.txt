waiting time for lifts was far too long used the stairs but had to come out at level because it was pitch black no emergency lights at all when i first checked in i was told i had booked for adults not adult and children this was incorrect i had to show them the confirmation email from booking com before they would confirm my accommodation for the night they then tried to squeeze an extra bed into a twin room without success before moving us to a family room which had an adjoining door with the guest next door who then complained about the noise we were making had three visits in total from the guest next door and security guards right up until who all witnessed there was no excess noise coming from myself and two year olds on their ipads not impressed with this at all seen as we had come down from scotland for one overnight ruined our stay completely won t be booking at the hilton again despite being offered a complimentary glass of wine not good enough
