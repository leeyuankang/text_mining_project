the bathroom was utterly discussing and dirty as my pictures show there were stains all over the tap lime scale everywhere layers of pee and human waste in the toilet seat fixture some diy repairs and just dirt everywhere stains on the shower curtain the bedding was falling apart my fingers were getting tangled in fibres coming out of the covers there was a burn mark on one of the blankets and the sound knob in the bathroom with dirty and not working the ventilation in the bathroom didn t work and when we all took a shower in the morning everything got steamed up and the room became very hot the staff were unpleasant and that s out mildly the pool was also dirty and the staff was unpleasant to all the guests the breakfast area was chaotic it was like wacky races the floor was covered in food it was scary at times our room wasn t cleaned on daily basis and we had to used wet towels the next again day i feel we were ripped off it s a hovel and not a hotel please avoid at all costs
