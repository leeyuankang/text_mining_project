the hotel lobby is lovely but the rooms are very dated and old there was a funny smell in my room and the walls skirtings and spots in the bathroom felt dirty needs a bit of a re vamp also the staff in the lobby kindly said that she gave me wi fi free of charge but normally you need to pay i think that is ridiculous considering the price of the hotel
