having to pay for internet feels like a rip off as it s a necessity in this day and age we were not allowed in our room for hours due to an arranged power cut not communicated to us at any point before arrival but still not offered free internet to soften the blow the lifts are pretty tedious cocktail bartenders were not great in service or technique the mini bar was dirty and still had the previous guests yoghurt inside it wasn t stocked but we were happy with that in the knowledge it s always a rip off
