we chose this expensive hotel because the photos on booking com seemed to show a rooftop restaurant with views over london and were really looking forward to sitting there in the evening for a meal when we arrived we were told there was no such roof restaurant although they admitted they had previously had other guests who had expected the same the restaurant was indoors on the ground floor and adjoining courtyard on the ground floor the photos we had seen were of the terrace of one of the penthouse suites showing tables chairs and food we were really disappointed and felt the advertising had been misleading
