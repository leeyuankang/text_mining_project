the milk in our room was off hard to do with uht we had a wake up call at we didn t ask for the bathroom couldn t fit people in it the windows were filthy for the view we paid for nights and the room was box size and described as a deluxe there was nothing deluxe about it and all you could do was lay on the bed and watch tv the space was so small and the tv didn t even work no volume no clear picture and offer of blurred channels in this is unheard of the room smelt from the previous person staying when we entered it i would like to add i have never in my life as a performer of years and travelling the world have ever felt the need to take time to write a complaint the booking promised a sofa bed for our son it had a chair the airconditioning in the room couldn t turn off so it was freezing all weekend at months pregnant and with a child travelling with us this lack of service was even more challenging and it has seriously put me off hilton and bookings com because we trusted you both with our money upon your recommendation the trip gave zero luxury as well we were guests to speak at an event that cost the billion dollar organisers tens of thousands to rent out times a year from hilton and this information has all been fed back to them now so that valuable custom for this hotel is now lost
