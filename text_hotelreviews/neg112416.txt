i was a little disappointed with the deluxe room no bottled water and only a few biscuits i also requested an early check in between and and received a message online a few days before my arrival saying although the hotel couldn t guarantee that would be possible it could well be ok we couldn t check in early and on our return to the hotel from a concert there was some confusion regarding where our luggage had been stored
