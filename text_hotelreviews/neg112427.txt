so me and my girlfriend both arrived at the hotel i booked us a king room when we arrived at our room the bed was smaller than the average double bed even though it s supposed to be a king and the carpets were stained everywhere the view was terrible and the tv said that it was going to be hd and but that didn t happen the tv we were given was not hd atall and it certainly wasn t so i went down to reception to complain and ask for us to be moved to a king sized room once i asked them that they obviously realised that they had put us in a standard double room i mean it could have been a simple mistake but it definatly didn t feel like one it felt like the members of staff had just seen teens coming for a romantic night in a hotel so they thought they would give us a terrible room it was disgusting and i don t undertstand why they would feel the need to place us in a worse room than what i had paid for like we pay the same as everyone else so why not treat us the same just because we may be younger than your usual guests anyway once we got given the room we eventually paid for it was exactly what it said on the tin except the view could have been a bit better
