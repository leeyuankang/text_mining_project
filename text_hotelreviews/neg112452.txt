it s expensive like all london rooms i paid for a family room for one night i have just paid similar in the past and got a much better room this price didn t include breakfast either breakfast is about pounds and children breakfast for free i have stayed for example at mal maison for just under pounds and this was inclusive of breakfast this hotel just wasn t as clean our room really smelt of smoke even though it was a non smoking room it had three single beds which is what we wanted but i suspect some people have used it as a party room also the room was a little bit tired shabby there was an old stain on the carpet and the bathroom needs a bit of an update the hairdryer was broken and had a bit of sellotape holding it together don t get me wrong it was ok it s just is a lot of money for one night in a hotel it really is i understand london is also expensive however i ve come to expect more for my money and you can get better than this for for sure
