we were so excited for this trip as it was our son s first time in london when we arrived we went to the check in desk and were told that the room we had booked didn t allow more than people even though i had a confirmation email that said under year olds were free of charge as long as they used existing beds i also contacted the hotel after i booked online to double check this was ok and they confirmed it was after travelling for a few hours this was the last thing we needed and it took a while at reception to sort out as the reception was so busy it put a real damper on the start of our trip the receptionist was not very friendly and advised us we would have to take it up with bookings com to which i was totally shocked and really disappointed at the customer service the receptionist then advised us we needed to speak to a supervisor but as no one was available and the queue was getting longer she ended up giving us the room we had booked not a great start to our trip and even more disappointing as we travelled with a party and the rest of the party stayed in the me hotel but we thought we would give the hilton a try after hearing good reviews we were disappointed to say the least it was also my husbands birthday the day after we checked in which was the purpose of the trip and i made a request when i booked the hotel to let the hotel know it was his bday so that they could maybe do something special as i had read they do this in the reviews when we woke up the next day nothing had been arranged and when i spoke to reception they told me no request had been recorded and that it was too late to do anything now this was really disappointing as i was really looking forward to my husband being surprised and making our trip that little bit more special but all it was was a huge disappointment i spoke to guest relations to inform them of this but they didn t seem interested
