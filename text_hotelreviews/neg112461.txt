the complete lack of transparency of this hotel and it s policies and it s staff i ve never seen in all my trips and hotel stays a hotel that takes a pathetic deposit at checkin to then only start taking money during night shifts from my card without my authorisation because to their own admission they want to make sure people don t leave without paying this is truly lame not ever heard of pre approval to not mention the impossibility to have in the room fridge any drinks as its their policy apparently to not service tower rooms with that another incredible one was second evening the shower was and remained cold impossible to do shower attitude of staff not fit for a hilton if you want to save yourself grief do not book here
