if we had a dislike it was the young children running around the hotel with total disregard for others an example of this was a young lad riding a scooter between tables in the bar or jumping onto furniture with his shoes on etc this could well have lead to an unfortunate accident or incident when no doubt the parents would blame the staff or other guests however this is a fault of poor parenting rather than members of staff or hotel
