i hate to say this because they are amazing people but the staff couldn t get our breakfast right i blame the management because they had just one person doing room service breakfast everyday our food came cold every morning n got orders wrong the pressure for whoever was working at that time was way too much but the management could do much better by getting extra helping hand
