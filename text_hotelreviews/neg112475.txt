the room we got given was very dirty a lot of dust and wallpaper coming off the walls the curtains had stains on them and the bath shower was falling apart the hallways near the room also had rubbish on the floor i have stayed in a lot of budget hotels in the last few years which were very clean and modern while this hotel wasn t worth the money paid at all and i will definitely not be going back
