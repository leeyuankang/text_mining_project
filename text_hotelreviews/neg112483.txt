when i booked they gave me a room which you could hardly rate it star smell of tobacco had remained in curtains and carpet they gave me worse room just because i had not book directly through hotel when i asked to change the room they did but again very uncomfirtsble bed and noisy was close to lift and neighbors were slamming the door all the time i did not sleep at all i am not a rich man from gulf countries who carries lots of notes with me i work so hard to get a treat like that the reason i booked the hotel was to have a good rest as i had a appointment in the nearby hospital the mini bar was left emty so no water at night to drink
