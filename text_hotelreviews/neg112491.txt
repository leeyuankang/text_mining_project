they look like they re in the process of updating the facilities the lobby bar areas are very nice but the rooms look a little dated a bit of peeling wallpaper bathroom fixtures looked rusty plus it was impossible to get the ac to work properly either too hot or too cold when they get the entire place renovated it will look very upscale but right now i was a little disappointed in the overall look of the rooms
