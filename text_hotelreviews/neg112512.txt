on arrival we were told our twin room was ready but upon entering the room and was clearly still occupied i returned to the check in desk and explained and i was given a room upgrade and use of the executive lounge upon entering this room we noticed that we d been given a double room instead of the twin we d requested went back down again and the guest relations desk rectified our room and moved our luggage so maybe the staff at check in just need to pay a little more attention to the types of room bookings
