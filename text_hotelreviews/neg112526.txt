the hotel is very old there are different buildings and we were located in the tower building which i can only assume was the oldest of them all the room smelled awful and the bathroom was even worse it was rusty and had this really bad smell in it the beds were not comfortable and there was only one working power outlet in the room there are no lights in the bedroom except for the nightstand lights so it was annoying having to always open those especially during the day since our windows didn t bring in a lot of light because we had the hilton building blocking any light that could come in the air conditioning was also very ancient the room could either be freezing or just too hot they definitively need to renovate and upgrade all the rooms found in the tower building wifi i have stayed at many hotels in my life seldom i find a hotel that charges its customers for wifi especially in a star hotel and especially in what a huge inconvenience when you pay per night one would expect wifi to be free oh and there is an additional charge for breakfast everything was an extra charge i think hilton can do a lot more when it comes to their customers having a nice stay at ther hotel i was talking about how horrible the rooms were with my friends and some customer staying on the same floor as us were all agreeing with our comments so i know i was not the only one which leads me to conclude that i will not be staying here ever again and will not be recommending this hotel to anyone i know definitively not worth it and i would suggest if others can find a hotel at almost the same price go to that one and stay away from this hilton hotel
