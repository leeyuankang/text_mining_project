thermostat needs turned up ran a bath after a long day in london and it was dissapointing requested a southern view but didn t receive even after check in staff told me i did have breakfast was lukewarm so once it hit the plates it became cold quickly was asked for deposit for mini bar and when checking out they managed to charge me again instead of refunding very dissapointing for my first hilton visit
