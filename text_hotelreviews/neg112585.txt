booked a king room but was asked on check in if it was two single beds needed advised no a double bed upgraded to an executive room i use this hotel annually for a business event and compared to the standard and deluxe rooms previously used the executive room was of a far lower standard the room had a king sized bed in front of a single head board a plinth of wood screwed to the wall suggesting the room was in the process of being renovated only one bedside table no net curtains at the window so as the room looked onto other rooms lift corridor the curtains had to be kept shut the room was unbearably hot even with the air conditioning on maximum light controls for the room hidden behind pillows
