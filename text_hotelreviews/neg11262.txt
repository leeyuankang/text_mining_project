room size was so small we could not put any luggage on the floor which means completely unpacking and storing it or putting it under the bed the sitting area was really too small to eat at when we ordered room service would have liked a view of the park as it was just a sliver twice the hot water disappeared in the middle of a shower and twice someone was walking on the roof early in the am which woke us up we made our complaints know so hopefully resolved for next guest
