i was leaving the hotel about am on of april there was only one person at the reception there was a line and i was in a hurry only after arrived some additional staff they turned on computers it took a while when they started to work everything was done in a very slow pace i asked them why there was only one person at the reception and why they arrived so late but i received quite unpolite response that there was a change of a shift and no apologies at all i was making some short video on my old phone for my family on a lobby of the hotel when security guy touched my shoulder in a quite rude way and told me that making video is prohibited by rules of the hotel it was so ridiculous like i was making video in a secret military property only after speaking to a manager they allowed me to do some video
