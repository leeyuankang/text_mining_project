as a business traveler and a member of the honors club i wanted to be able to go away for work in the morning without checking out of my room so that in the instance that i finished my business early i could come back to the hotel and still have access to my room until the designated check out time i spoke to different members of staff regarding this in the morning who assured me that i would have access to my room until when i returned to the hotel early i was extremely disappointed to find out that i had been checked out of my room early what was even more frustrating is that the staff were unwilling to rectify the problem and did not take responsibility for the error caused on their behalf even though i spoke to different members of staff to ensure this exact thing didn t happen our company travels to london frequently for work and we will not be staying here again
