due to location i think there was an incessant almost foghorn shiphorn it sounded like going off all day and most of the night every few seconds or so audible from our room in the tower wing upon looking out there were a few building yards so assume it was as a result of one of those this was tolerable as we had a short stay longer than a few nights would have driven me mad also with regards to location fair walking distance to main attractions in the city which leaves options of taxi tube bus all at a cost
