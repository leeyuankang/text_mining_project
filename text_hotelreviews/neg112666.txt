the hotel overall is good we stayed many times before this time though it was a terrible experience the room was freezing cold because the heating was not working the last thing we wanted at o clock in the morning was the engineer messing about for half an hour to try and fix the heating while we were waiting for extra blankets to arrive not happy at all and at for one night it wouldn t have broken your bank to throw breakfast in the deal i mean how much does it cost for a couple of eggs and two pieces of toast and a couple of sausages then the day we were leaving we were back in time at the hotel to make sure that we did not overstay at the car park so we wouldn t have to pay for an extra day s parking alas after waiting for a good ten minutes to be served we were told that there was only one attendant that would accept cash as that particular cashier was very busy dealing with a problem customer i decided to make my way to the other side of the hotel where i was told that there is a machine that accepts cash only to find when i got there that it was out of order so back i trek to the reception desks where to my shock i found that your cashier was still dealing with the problem customer and needless to say by the time we got to pay we were past the special weekend rate and ended up paying more not a pleasant stay at all we won t be returning any time soon
