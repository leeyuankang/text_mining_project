i believe the problem started with booking com who did not inform the hotel of our updated booking which caused chaos on arrival with people to organise and the rooms all mixed up my daughters room was not clean my sisters room had sweet papers under the sheets and a shoe horn when she opened the bed she also had no cold water and her shower was broken we ordered afternoon tea as a special treat in advance as it was my two daugters and birthdays advising that one person was gluten and wheat intolerant an hour and half later we were still waiting for this they said due to the fact they had to go out and buy special stuff even though it was pre ordered we cancelled in the end as the whole experience was ruined they also tried to say one stand of food with six finger sandwiches on it and cakes was for people the same evening my sister asked if the chips were ok for her to eat they told you they did not know whether they contained gluten or wheat hopeless also we paid in full on arrival yet the hotel used the bank details i gave booking com and took out of my account i am struggling to get this back as i write this this hotel for a hilton hotel leaves a lot to be desired and improved
