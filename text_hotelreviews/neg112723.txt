as per my previous stay at a hilton hotel i had to change room three times before finding one in acceptable condition when i checked in i was told i was being given a complimentary upgrade to an executive room however the room was a little tired and on a top floor directly underneath a roof aircon generator the room literally reverberated from the noise and it would have been impossible to concentrate let alone sleep i was then given another executive room on a lower floor but this was even more shabby with only two small lights in the bedroom ceiling these were down lighters above the headboard making it difficult to prepare for an evening out or an early morning exit the bathroom was in very poor condition and smelled my third attempt for a decent room was more fruitful and the lady who dealt with me said she would give me a refurbished room why on earth was i not given one of these in the first place which was very nice but the television could not acquire a full signal despite the best efforts of the maintenance man very difficult to get any sleep due to the noise of the air conditioning lost my voice within hours of arrival due to the unhealthily dry air having stayed here several times the whole thing is hit and miss not good value for money
