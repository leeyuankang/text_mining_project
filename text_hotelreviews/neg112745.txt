as we walked into the hotel to check in we where greeted by staff and shown where to check in as we checked in we found the staffs english hard to understand made it even worse when we phoned to complain they referred us to the restaurants phone line which was totally irrelevant we then went to our room which didn t look anything like what we seen in pictures it also had a bad smell and was very out dated every night we could hear the lift going up and down and found this very annoying the hilton also took two payments out of my bank which totalled up to pound which i later had to contact the bank to get this back as the hilton found that they couldn t do anything to help definitely not worth the money
