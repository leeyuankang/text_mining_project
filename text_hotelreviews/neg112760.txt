the only fault was i was charged for children s meals even though hilton offers under years to eat free when bringing this matter up with staff out check out very unhelpful and said room was only booked for adult not adult children even after i stated this was incorrect and i had to input all children s ages at time of booking hence why a double queen room was recommended and booked it took a further minutes to sort with numerous calls to the restaurant i even showed them on the hilton honors website where it states children eat free and the lady still insisted she had never heard of this before finally begruggingly she refunded the money
