have to say the only disappointment was the experience we had at breakfast there were so many people that a queuing system was put in place but not everyone complied with it the hotel staff were too lenient with people just avoiding the queue and walking straight into the dining area to find a table once in the dining area there were more queues but again not everyone understood what a queue was the food was very average and only warm we would stay at this hotel again but we wouldn t book breakfast as there is a wetherspoons pub a few hundred years away and their breakfast is very good served hot and much cheaper
