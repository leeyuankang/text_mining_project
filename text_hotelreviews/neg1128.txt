staff were rude and not very pleasant to deal with at reception i also called in house service for a cup as we were only given one in our room i spoke to a very rude man who told me to call housekeeping but didn t give me an extension number once i called reception they said they would called in house service but i still didn t receive the cup perhaps this individual member of staff mentioned above begrudgingly didn t feel it was his duty p also used the public computers at the reception but the printers didn t work not much point of them being there in my view or perhaps just do some maintenance in summary great stay and i would stay again but a reminder to hotel that a smile goes a long way
