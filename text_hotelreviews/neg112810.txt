as mentioned in my booking i had booked this hotel as i was celebrating my girlfriends birthday as a surprise although check in was at we arrived at to drop our bags off i managed to check in also at the reception desk the member of staff i checked in with confirmed i had a non smoking room and that she was going to check to see if my room was ready she told me it wasn t and so therefore i could come back later to pick up the room keys from reception we the left the hotel as we had a show to attend to and some shopping to do we arrived back at the hotel just after i went back to reception to pick up the room keys only to be told the room was not ready and they only room they had was a smoking room or an accessibility room obviously i was extremely annoyed as this contradicted what was said to me earlier i was then told that if i wanted a non smoking room i would have to wait half hour or so as i had already made reservations for drinks and dinner elsewhere we were struggling for time so i had no choice but accept the smoking room as a good will gesture the only thing i was offered was free wifi which did not work at all we got to our room which smelt horrendous and had dirt all up the walls and the carpet not to mention a tv that only had working channels that were all in a different language the room we were given was on the first floor and the noise coming from the cars on the street below was so loud we hardly slept all night i complained about the tv a gentleman arrived about minutes later to have a look he could speak any english but all he could say is that the to was broken i could of told him that myself he said their was nothing he could do and left all in all an awful hotel unhelpful staff massive queues in reception and disgusting rooms will never stay their again and would not reccomend this hotel
