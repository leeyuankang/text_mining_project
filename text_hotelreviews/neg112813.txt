we were told in check in after pre booking months in advance that there was only smoking double rooms available didn t think this was even allowed anymore we were then allocated twin non smoking rooms which i can only discribe as tiny and disgusting i refused to stay in both rooms and was given an upgrade by very helpful staff this was a much better room but still nothing special on our check out we wanted to leave our bags with concierge to then have to queue for over minutes to do this i will definitely not be returning here
