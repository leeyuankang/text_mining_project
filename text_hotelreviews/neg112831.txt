the towels smell bad and were old the staff put on my account half of the mini bar because i put it on the desk in order to clean some space in the refrigerator for some fruits of mine after asking for a person to come and check that everything is there and unopened they told me a red bull is missing and i had to pay for it despite we did not drink it the room service food was very expensive we could hear the noises from outside so the experience was kind of a bad memory
