i didn t like almost everything so many of the staff were very rude for instance we came at pm for dinner in the restaurant that takes reservation until and the waitress straight asked us for the order when we asked for more minutes she said that we had to hurry up she did not give any service either placed the starter without cutleries and did not bring them either did not clear the empty starter when the main course came an other example at the front desk one of the receptionist agent that seemed to be a supervisor refused to give the change of pounds saying to the one that was checking us in it s my cashier i don t have to give you anything right it front of us result our receptionist had to go to the bar to get the change this is unacceptable and i do work in luxury hospitality i know what i talk about when i say that i would sanction such rude behavior in front of guests also in the room there is no mini bar and no amenities shaving kit tooth brush cotton and yet were staying in a higher category superior king room the room is much much smaller than it looks on the pictures
