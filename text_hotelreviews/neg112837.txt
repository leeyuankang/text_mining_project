when we got to the room i realised the fridge was empty there was not even a bottle of water left i called the reception and informed and asked for some water i was told they were going to send some shortly no one came before i went out i asked again in the reception area i was told they would when i came back at night there was still no sign of water i gave up i thought that was pretty bad treatment no respect for customers you also need to pay for the internet if you want to use the internet in your room free of charge internet is only available in the lobby area
