the bed was very uncomfortable i never have back ache but i felt sick in the morning because my back ached that much i told the receptionist on checking out and she said she would tell the manager but that obviously didn t make any difference to me as i had endured it for nights and was checking out the changing rooms in the swimming pool were tiny and had no privacy you had to basically get ready in front of everyone which i wasn t comfortable doing as i had my year old son with me and he could see everyone getting changed
