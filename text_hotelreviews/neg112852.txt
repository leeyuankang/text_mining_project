upon arrival at to the hotel i was told my room would not be available until after this was done and i checked in completing all of the relevant paperwork to prevent me from having to go through it when i returned i was advised it would be a case of collecting my keys in return in return to the hotel after a busy day in london i had to wait approximately another mins on collecting my keys the original room that i was told i would be getting i e single beds appeared to be not available and i had to take a room with a king size bed and single bed if i hadn t accepted this then god knows when i would have got into my room i think for the price of the hotel this was very poor service also on the final day of our trip my keys to the room stopped working another inconvenience when you are floors up then to be asked for id at the reception when the id is locked in the safe inside the room is pretty poor
