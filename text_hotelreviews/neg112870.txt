always stay in a hilton hotel when travelling this was my first time in london and the first time i have been so disappointed in a hilton hotel beds uncomfortable had to pay for wi fi television didn t work shower didn t turn off four plug sockets in the room only two of them worked staff were unfriendly i have never came across such unhelpful people everything was too much hassle for them and as for the gym and pool facilities it was very poor was going to make a complaint at your how was your stay desk but there was a couple who were there for ages complaing about pretty much everything i have listed the manager only seemed interested in keeping the couple quiet as other hotel guests were checking in and didn t want them knowing what the hotel was really like this hotel is terrible and not worth the money
