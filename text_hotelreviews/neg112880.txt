my mother i had booked a twin room but were given a room with one double bed we returned to reception and were given a different room in the tower section of the hotel the room looked grubby shabby not what i expected st all for the huge price tag wallpaper scuffed and peeling off the wall black marks here there the rest generally looking old dirty wooden doors scuffed and chipped the whole tower section is being refurbished apparently but meanwhile awful rooms are still being let at a price about times what they re worth
