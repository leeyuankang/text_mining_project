i was over charged for the parking as the clocks had gone back an hour and the parking machine wasn t updated therefore the exit time was showing an hour ahead i asked a member of staff for help who told me to pay the ticket and then go to front desk and they will refund the extra hour that i was charged for when i got to the front desk the lady was very apologetic and could clearly see the mistake made she even made a phone call to her colleague to make sure the clocks were turned back on the machine so no other customers would have the same problem she then told me to wait a few minutes as she needed to get authorization to refund the extra hour however this other lady came out and said i was not allowed to have a refund for the extra hour as it was not the hotels policy to give refunds even the first lady was a bit shocked as to how we were spoken too i left feeling very disappointing as to what was a great weekend
