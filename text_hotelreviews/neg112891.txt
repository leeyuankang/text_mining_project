i was not very happy with the room we ve got d corner of the floor with the extension outside the glass window especially when we open the curtains also my daughters friend had to sleep in the floor because the beds are squeaky with our night stay i m very disappointed with the swimming pool because i was very excited to do some swimming but it was shut for some reason but above all for me it is very expensive the price we pay for two nights but i think that s the normal price in london also it s a hilton hotel the best known hotel in the world
