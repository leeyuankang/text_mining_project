when we returned to the room late afternoon it had not been cleaned i phoned downstairs and someone arrived with tea coffee no milk when i asked if the bin was to be emptied or the towels changed etc i was told they would have to contact housekeeping finally someone else arrived and asked what i wanted done i almost felt it was my fault i don t expect this from the hiton breakfast was vastly over priced
