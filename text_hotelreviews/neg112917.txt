accommodation was only very average for the cost the bed was uncomfortable giving a very poor night s sleep the night before a big event and is most certainly not what i expected breakfast was over priced and best described as warm and seating was cramped with slow poor service having stayed in a few hotels recently we have had far far better service and facilities for much less cost and with a personal touch too on departure our comments were not solicited my wife i wouldn t hurry back to this hotel
