when i called the hotel to ask if there was a restriction on check in time the customer service operate said i believe it is hours and that there should not be a problem this is not a very definite response when i asked her to check and confirm that all was in order with my booking should could not find it because i booked with bookings com and then transferred me to two different numbers where nobody picked up then said there was nothing she could do so i had to ring back later this is not very helpful when you are traveling what would have happened if they did not find my booking when i got there given my card had already been charged was i going to have to book another room on check in which took approx mins i was told i had a smoking room i did not request this and if i wanted a non smoking room it would cost and additional gbp per night there was very little provided in the room not even complimentary water hairdryer the volume from the tv in the room next door was very high and could be heard clearly until late in the night so for a bad experience not very friendly staff a non smoking room it has cost me gbp for nights i am not happy
