the very poor customer service from the main reception on arrival found the required cot hadn t been allocated to the room we called customer service who informed us this would be done within minutes on arrival back from a trip out we found out once again there was no cot we called customer service once again to be told they wasn t sure why the cot hadn t arrived and received zero apology the cot did finally arrive and was assembled however with mins of putting our year old to bed we turned the light on to see the bed base had collapsed broken creating our year old to go under the mattress we called customer service who brought us a new cot minutes later please note it was at night at this point it took us over an hour to calm our baby back to sleep however she wouldn t go back into the new cot when informing the front desk the following morning we received no apology and a big lack of concern to what could if been a fatal incident this lack of customer care was unacceptable
