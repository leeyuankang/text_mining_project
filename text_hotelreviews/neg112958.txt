first of all we requested to stay in the new tower and we paid for it however they put us in the old tower we waited hours to check in the staff was very rude and inpatient even though we are hhonars we also had to wait even more for our second room to be honest the lobby was breath taking however the rooms were the total opposite they charged us for using the mini bar which we haven t even touched most shocking thing was one of the room service employees knocked the door while my little daughter was staying inside and asked to see the mini bar then returned and asked her to teach him arabic he also asked for her phone number she said that she doesn t have one and then gave her his skype name on a piece of paper we were in shock so we went to the manager with the hand written piece of paper and told him about it and he did absolutely nothing about it accessibility after was limited the ac wasn t working well and the shower was broken i have been traveling for many years and i have been to over hotels around the world in countries i was surprised that hilton had such poor unprofessional quality of services the hotel was surrounded with poor people who kept asking for money and also one crazy person tried to enter the hotel overall i would never recommend anyone to stay there
