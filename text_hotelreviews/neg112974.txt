once we arrived the receptionist told me that the room is a bit different and wider when i entered the room i found out the furniture of the room is made for handicapped people when i asked to change the room or to upgrade they refused and said they don t have rooms the second thing is that they took my luggage to some other occupant room and they couldn t find it until i investigated and found that they took it to the room next to me the room service never answered from the first call the reception has desks but you can find two active or by max
