regrettably this time we had a long wait to check in and although after our room wasn t ready we were later given a room in the tower as requested but right outside the lift which was noisy and with a view of a brick structure we found a used tissue on the floor in the room and despite reception saying they would send some water up for us this did not arrive we do expect better service for the price you charge
