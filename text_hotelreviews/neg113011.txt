too much time to check in and receptionist was not aware about the room rate that i booked through booking as he tried to charge me when i showed him the booking he then said the price that he has in the system is different and he changed it but i think it took too much time for us to check in wifi isn t free which it should considering the price that you pay the hotel itself is really old and overall i don t think that i ll stay again in this hotel
