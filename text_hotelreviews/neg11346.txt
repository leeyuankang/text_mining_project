the bathroom was small and the floor got wet when using the shower as there was no step or tray to contain the water made it slippery to use the toilet glass door got in the way of the entrance the spa facilities were poor and not very clean signage was lacking in the hotel made it difficult to find out where to go for the spa breakfast bar etc unless you asked staff
