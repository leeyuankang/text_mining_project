after waiting for hours over our check in time i finally visited the front desk after watching numerous older couples successfully getting a room key and after explaining that i was told to wait for a room and then watching other go through miraculously a room became available i felt throughly discriminated against because we was a younger couple then after walking around london all day we wanted to order room service after trips to the reception and broken phone we finally got lots of fish and chips i never usually complain and this may seem like mediocre complaints but when it s your fianc s birthday you just want everything to be perfect highly disappointed
