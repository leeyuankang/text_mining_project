since being refurbished and changed from a holiday inn to crowne plaza it seems what were previously good sized rooms have now been made into cramped rooms not enough floor space to put your suitcase without having to manouevre around it all the time bed was lumpy and felt like springs were coming through probably the worst bathroom design i have ever seen the elevated shower tray has a lip of around maybe mm and the shower head is positioned half behind the glass shower screen the end result is that everything gets soaking wet floor toilet toilet paper absolutely everything because it is all so close together in the small bathroom my shower flooded everything and passed through into the bedroom carpets and as a result had to change rooms staff were very helpful with this but really not the point breakfast is a standard buffet type priced at an astonishing pounds per head if you buy in advance then you get vouchers and the price is discounted to pounds i find it hard to believe that most people could eat pounds worth of breakfast if costed at true value not good value at all and at times it seemed that certain items such as sausages were carry over from the previous day on arrival i was told that since changing to crown plaza then the free wifi no longer requires login or password what they didnt point out was that the wifi is now unsecured and as such my businness and personal applications on laptop tablet and phone would not permit me to connect kind of frustrating when you are travelling on business and wifi is important although i didnt see it my nose told me that there must be a swimming pool possibly at basement level reception smells strongly of chlorine location at best is ok but not great with a good minutes walk to nearest tube or main station and the area certainly isnt trendy or smart and to get anywheer of interest etc involves a decent hike on foot tube etc
