the room was smelly when we first checked in the ac was not working properly so at night i was sweating we turned the temperature to strongest fan and lowest temperature but still not much cool air it was a beating the distance to the tube stations were not that close but we discovered a bus number that would shuttle us from king s cross to the hotel so we just budgeted extra minutes to our trips to account for bus travel time
