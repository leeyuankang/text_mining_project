the hotel has gone through a refurbishment and changed from a holiday inn to crowne plaza previously rooms were a good size and although a little tired were relatively comfortable now rooms have been made smaller presumably to increase number of rooms overall and are too small not even enough space to leave your suitcase somewhere without it getting in the way and overall feels claustraphobic windows dont open so you wake desperately needing fresh air beds are lumpy and it feels like you can feel the springs probably the worst designed bathroom i have ever seen shower tray is elevated and has a rim of about the shower heads are positioned so that you can barely stand behind the glass shower screen and the end result is that a lake is created on the bathroom floor and the spray from the water soaks everything from the bath mat to toilet tissue i had an issue with my bathroom whereby water was seeping under the walls and created pools in the bedroom carpet staff were very helpful in this instance but i had to change rooms and was upgraded to a club room which was a better size but same bathroom etc and mini bar was locked and inaccesible the hotel has also changed its wifi now no password needed but the connection is not a secure one this meant that my business laptop and applications would not permit me to connect same with some personal apps so as a business traveller it meant i couldnt work buffet breakfast is extremely expensive at nearly pounds if you buy vouchers in advance you get pounds discount but even then it is expensive and overpriced room rates very variable depending on which night stayed but range from around to pounds per night which is high it may be london but its not the west end nor the most glamorous of areas i beieve there is a pool in the basement but as a result the whole of reception area smell strongly of chlorine
