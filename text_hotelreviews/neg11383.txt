i ate at the belgo restaurant one evening the food was only just warm the waiter did not offer any condiments and i could not get his attention again i ended up leaving most of the food as it was too dry some of the attention in the bathroom could have been better i moved to another room where the toilet was coming away from the wall but accepted this since i didn t want to be next to the lift the mini bars are empty meaning not even being able to have any bottled water late evening or early morning two times i went to the fitness and spa and not all facilities were possible due to cleaning these could be done out of hours but at least cleansiness maintenance was paramount the only complaint there is that they should visit the sauna there was wood worms by the door coming from the wood frames
