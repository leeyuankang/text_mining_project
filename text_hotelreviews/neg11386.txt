we booked a room with double beds but there was not one available and so we were given a standard double room the guests in the next room were very loud and partied with doors banging until the air conditioning was noisy making a rattling noise all the time which seemed to become more noticeable when you tried to sleep the room was not overly clean and the remote for the tv seemed to be mood dependent when it wanted to work at breakfast the food was lovely but the dining room was a mess tables were not cleared there was cutlery missing from the table no one offered tea or coffee at the table or directed you where to find anything there was no printed information about the hotel or its facilities in the room we did not even know it had a pool or spa
