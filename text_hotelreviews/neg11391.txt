the hotel was a minute walk from kings cross station with a suitcase this was a nightmare ended up spending more money on taxi fare and buses hotel staff in reception were not very pleasant and very abrupt never smiled and almost seemed irritated with me asking questions main toilets in the hotel were on level in a hotel room as they were having a refurbishment when arriving at the hotel in the morning i couldnt check in until and needed the toilet what they didnt tell you was you needed a pass and anyone could just walk in very strange and i was not advised of any of this upon checking in overall very disorganised and customer service not great
