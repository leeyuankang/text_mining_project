trying to order room service took over minutes a number of calls to reception that did not finish the call before putting the phone down and the kitchen restaurant not answering the phones also the worst part was the fact that all the systems were down so i was unable to get a receipt on booking in they tried applying a charge then on checking out still unable to get a receipt and still today i have been unsuccessful in gaining a receipt meaning i shall not be able to claim on my expenses for the accommodation despite a number of messages to the hotel and calls i still have not got a receipt very disappointing and would recommend booking com removing them
