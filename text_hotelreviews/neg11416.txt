the cooked breakfast was practically cold this was on both mornings so was not a one off case we would have been better off going room only and eating out the staff were not helpful on arrival this was our first time here and we had no idea where to find anything it would have been helpful if they had asked if we had been here before and if not they should have a taken the time to tell us where things were apparently there is a bar somewhere reception staff looked miserable and unapproachable all in all not a very friendly hotel
