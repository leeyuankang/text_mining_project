when i came back to the hotel almost my room wasn t made up i found this a bit annoying as i had been out and about since and had to go to the lounge to wait until the room was ready while at the lounge i waited what seemed to be an interminable length to order a drink eventually a manager came along spotted me and immediately got a floor staff member to take an order which was delivered promptly however when it came to paying for the drink i found it difficult to find any floor staff to pay and eventually went to the bar to pay for the drink the chairs in the lounge were a bit grubby in contrast to the room furnishings
