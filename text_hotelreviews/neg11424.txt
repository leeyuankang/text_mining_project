the hot water for the bath never achieved anywhere near degrees the room was very warm even though the ac was turned down to it s lowest setting and i overheard another guest complaining about this at checkout when i went to open the room door from the inside i happened to look up and there was a gap between the ceiling and the door frame of about a foot filled with wires which was a bit disconcerting on checkout i was asked to wait while they checked my room for damages yup while they checked my room for damages that is literally what the receptionist told me i told her i was very insulted and she said i m sorry and then shrugged the shrug was the last straw i m not sure the british are very good with shrugs so i took it to the manager who was very receptive and listened carefully and promised to report the woman to her manager i wouldn t return again i ve had these problems with star hotels before it s always better to go high or modest not somewhere that is trying too hard to live off the parent companies name
