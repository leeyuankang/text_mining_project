location a bit too far out which we didn t really understand when booking our fault bit would have hoped for a nearer tube stop the bed and pillows were really uncomfortable and we had a bad nights sleep the queue for the check in was also really long longer than we have ever seen at a hotel at check in time the staff were also quite aloof and unfriendly compared to other hotels we have stayed in
