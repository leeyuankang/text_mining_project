we rang to reception to find out about the spa to be told it was in the basement we then had to call at reception to ask again as the lift didn t go to the basement due to refurb work that was all fine except it gave the reception staff two opportunities to tell us we needed to pay to use the facilities which would have saved my hubby from having to go right back to the room for money jacuzzi then not working when we got in there did think the spa let the hotel down
