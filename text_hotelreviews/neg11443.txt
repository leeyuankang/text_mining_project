on arrival the receptionist spoke so quickly that we couldn t understand we were disappointed to find out we had to pay for the pool this was not clear on the website the jacuzzi wasn t even working and the pool was smaller than it looked on website i chose the hotel based on the photos of the pool so very disappointing the bedroom but especially the breakfast restaurant was uncomfortably warm more air needed in there
