firstly the entrance to the hotel is pretty awful the lift works when it feels like it the amount of stairs in the hotel was an issue carrying cases up and down the first night we arrived the air con didn t work in our originally booked triple room the room was stifling we complained to the night receptionist who moved us to a room on the top floor which was then only a double room no single beds so my friend and i ended up sharing a bed the breakfast was not delivered on either morning we had to ask for it each morning the staff were not at all approachable the night receptionist did not inform the day shift that we had moved rooms all in all it was pretty shambolic i will never stay in a best western hotel again will i use booking com again not sure
