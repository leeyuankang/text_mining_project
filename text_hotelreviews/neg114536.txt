not a good hotel for people with mobility issues lots of stairs and rather confusing to find your way around i d hoped for a bar and lounge to relax in there isn t one you can get a drink from the reception desk and sit in the breakfast room but no comfortable sociable space my television didn t work wasted a lot of time trying to re programme the channels myself then a member of staff tried the same couldn t fix it so ended up being moved rooms all took time which i d hoped to spend relaxing after a very long day at a conference my room was at the back above a nando s restaurant so had cooking smells coming into my room and had to listen to their staff out the back chatting until late at someone went repeatedly up and down the corridor banging their way through the fire doors over and over again and they tried my door handle as a female in the room alone this was very frightening i d paid extra to book a hotel with breakfast included and was looking forward to a proper breakfast buffet with a cooked breakfast to set me up for the day ahead as the hotel is being refurbished the breakfast s were being served to go breakfast was served to my room in a box mine actually didn t arrive i had to chase it up half an hour after i had booked it to be delivered and whilst the contents were ok it wasn t what i would have chosen to eat i wish i d not paid for breakfast and had just gone two doors along to waitrose and got some food and drink for a fraction of the cost the member of staff who tried to sort out the telly and then moved me to another room was very nice and helpful but overall for the few hours i spent in the hotel there were a lot of issues and it was very expensive for the size of room and the disappointing breakfast
