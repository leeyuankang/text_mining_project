between and midnight there was a very loud vibrating sound shaking the windows i suspected air conditioning units from the restaurant next door were causing this the noise did stop but i think this is a problem they should investigate the breakfast lobby was under reconstruction breakfast was delivered to my room on saturday sunday i did not receive any breakfast for some reason i should have said but was in rush to pack up and leave that morning
