the bathroom was not clean hair on the toilet and a dirty shower are the welcome we have received the bed had a very old spring mattress and in the room there was a creepy mirror wall covered by a shade is this supposed to be a four stars hotel the hotel had no breakfast area all they do is providing the customers with a lame breakfast box in the room at a specific time some cold stuff in it and a coffee or so and don t try to call the reception if you are in need to anticipate it because the answer is no apparently they are doing renovations so the breakfast area is not available for who knows how long but they don t tell you this detail until you get to the reception to check in so much for the continental breakfast included this is my last stay in a best western
