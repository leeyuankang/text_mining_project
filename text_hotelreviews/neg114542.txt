room was too small called a premier room because of alterations we had to eat breakfast in our room this was unacceptable as it was so small the bed was a nightmare lumpy and uneven we were told there was an option of a bath but on arrival told there was no baths at all the bedroom was dark no window as such the only positive was we had a very busy itinery so we re not there for long
