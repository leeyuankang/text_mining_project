the whole experience from check in to check out was a disaster we arrived on out business trip to be greeted by construction at the reception area there was no one at the desk to check us in we needed to find one of the cleaning staff after mins to alert reception that customers were had arrived once the receptionist arrived he was extremely rude we were told that the dining room was closed and breakfast would be delivered to the room the next day not a major issue there we thought when we mentioned that we were surprised by the level of construction and the effect this had on the overall quality of the hotel experience we were met with an unbelievable answer he informed us that because we had booked through booking com he mentioned it was our prerogative to inform booking com of the construction and not the hotels this is ridiculous we were told to come back later as he could not check us in at so grudgingly we left our bags and went to work the rooms were basic enough the morning s breakfast did not arrive we checked out at and three other guests were complaining that breakfast had not arrived in their room either the same arrogant attitude was present from a different member of staff all in all this was a terrible stay from start to finish we were there for only one night but i would advise everyone to seek alternative arrangements in the kensington area best western is a recognised name in the uk hospitality industry this is one of the worst experiences i have had in many years of business travel staff experience value for money at per room do not stay here
