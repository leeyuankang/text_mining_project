i detested the poor welcome of the receptionist on duty when we arrived when we arrived at our room was not ready and we were told to leave our baggage and go back later and we were also informed that the breakfast was boxed no apologies for anything no upgrades or late check out offered to us it was our problem not the hotel according to him our agent booking should have warned us about the refurbishment but i do not agree because at the time of booking and paying the repairs hadn t begun and when i complained about the boxed breakfast his answer left me dumbfounded according to him as breakfast was complimentary and we hadn t paid for it we couldn t complain he made us feel not welcome we could see none of the staff we had met before and they were far better
