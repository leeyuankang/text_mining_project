the hotel is currently undergoing renovation having said that we paid for breakfast and although we knew at the time of booking that it was a continental breakfast we didn t mind what we had was a stale croissant the tiniest muffin i have ever seen a hard boiled egg that wasn t freshly prepared an apple and a carton of orange juice how best weston had the nerve to charge for this i ll never know i would never recommend this hotel to anyone and i most certainly won t be staying there again
