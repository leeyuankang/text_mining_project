the bedroom was extremely small the bathroom whilst clean with good quality fittings was tiny the radiator made access to the sink difficult i could not shave over the sink as the mirror was above the toilet the hotel is undergoing major building work as a result no restaurant we booked expecting continental breakfast we were informed on arrival that we would be provided with a breakfast box this arrived but contained food of poor quality i also had to walk through the building works to get a coffee i think that we should have been advised of the limited facilities at time of booking
