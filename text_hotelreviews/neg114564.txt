on arrival the main door had a sign saying please use side door so we did and the lift was not working and there were no stairs we tried the intercom to reception it did not work we spent about mins trying to contact someone no replies eventually a man another customer said try the front door again it was working a while ago which we did and it was open we trudged up two flights of stairs with luggage and found a small reception in the middle of building works we should have been told about the building works when we booked i said to the receptionist the lift and intercom from outside the side enterence is not working he said ok he then booked us in and the cheek of it we had already paid and he asked for deposit i gave him a note he said your room is another flights up i said no lift he just grimmest no offer to help with our luggage not happy the room was small and pokey the bathroom was the size of my wardrobe at home very small indeed the room temperature was extremely hot so we opened a window and the street noise was unbearable breakfast was a joke the fresh fruit was a cereal bowl of chopped apple that had gone brown a limited supply of pastries and when some were brought out the were gone within seconds on leaving we checked out the receptionist did not give us our deposit back i asked for it and he said sorry forgot about that forgot he was trying to pull a fast one and hope we left without asking for it we were very disappointed with our stay at this hote probably the worst we have ever stayed at
