the only entrance to reception is via a small hoist type lift to the floor for two persons max the only staircase is a fire escape you can exit but not enter on exit you come into a side yard and walk past the rubbish bins and debris to the street there was an apology notice for work being undertaken but this did not affect the restricted entrance and exit the reception was also the bar and breakfast room the bedroom ok but not good value
