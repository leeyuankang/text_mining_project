the wifi is very slow and you constantly have to log in our room was very very small and only had a tiny window facing a wall other people in our group had great rooms with large windows with street views and large bathrooms for the same price that we paid it didn t seem right i booked this hotel because it said it had an elevator and we were travelling with older people and yes the hotel has an elevator but the elevator only goes from the ground floor to the first floor and the rooms were higher up which was unfortunate
