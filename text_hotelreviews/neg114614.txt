the staff is the most unaccomidating i ve ever encountered my husband and i traveled from paris to london with no problems with wifi i asked the staff three times the first night concerning the non functioning wifi in our room the one staff member basically said there was something wrong with my phone or user error yet the moment i went downstairs and went to the dining area there was no problem connecting they just repeated over and over nothing was wrong and no one else had been complaining that was until someone walked in headed back to their room asking if the wifi was fixed yet according to the staff no one had made a complaint fishy however the bed bugs is what sent us running i went downstairs after scratching all day to ask staff to switch us to a different room as i had about ten bites he said this was impossible as there were no other rooms available i asked three times then to speak to a manager who was unavailable til the next morning but once my husband realized he was getting bit he went downstairs to talk to the same person all of a sudden there was a room available this member of staff was rude the whole time and said i wasn t even considering moving to another room but minutes prior there was no other room to move to so after asking for a refund and being on the phone with booking com the we were only refunded for two nights however i paid for they only refunded me for the two nights we stayed not even the two nights we did not stay and had to book another hotel down the street which was so understanding and accomidatimg probably the single best hotel we ve stayed at when we are in london next we will not hesitate to book with hilton double tree
