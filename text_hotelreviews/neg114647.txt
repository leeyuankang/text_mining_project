this is the noisiest hotel i have ever stayed in room avoid like the plague seems to be situated over the stairs and you hear every sound coupled with that there were renovations being done on the roof which started before on a sunday no notification given at time of booking and no prior warning at check in i complained but the lily liveried manager in reception refused to accept my complaint and even suggested i was lying stating that builders had told him they didn t start til after we heard another couple complain get angry and even demand to speak to best western manager to no avail totally spoiled what would have been a pleasant stay in a quirky hotel won t be back to try again that s for certain
