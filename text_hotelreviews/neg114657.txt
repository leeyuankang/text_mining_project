the staff were incredibly rude i was made to wait minutes to check in because the only member of staff available was a trainee which was absolutely fine as she was lovely however when the manager finally arrived he did not apologise himself instead he huffed and puffed demanded i pay immediately handed me my key and disappeared off into the back despite arranging a late check out over my booking and at the reception desk upon arrival i was awoken the next morning to bangs on my door and numerous calls demanding to know when i was going to leave as they had to clean the room
