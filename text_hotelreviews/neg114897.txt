excellent location great service immaculate rooms great a shower breakfast was poor microwaved porridge and undercooked eggs and when i asked for ice they said they had no access to the ice machine but your in london so go out for breakfast i assume the hotel is separate from the restaurant so whilst it s be good of they get a key these little niggles weren t a big deal it s a great spot for the price
