restaurant bar didn t have any dry white wine other than the house which was mediocre at best every option i asked for they were out only one salad option no soup but i could have walked to plenty of other places in the area now wished i had room was very warm and stuffy on arrival the room thermostat had a dial but only one temperature came out hot i don t like to sleep in a warm room so had very little sleep the point of me staying over night was to be well rested for an important meeting when i booked i asked for a fan as this is sadly the case with many hotels but had to request after check in but made little difference to the room as not fresh air to circulate and already hot on arrival i will not be using this hotel again
