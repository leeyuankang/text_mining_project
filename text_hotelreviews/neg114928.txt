i really liked the hotel and selected it specifically for the location because we were attending the carnival and for the facilities including complimentary breakfast and restaurant which were showing as available on booking com when the reservation was made about a week before notting hill carnival we were emailed and told there would be a party with loud music held at the bar restaurant below and because of the the breakfast facilities would not be the usual standard this seemed unfair when the rate had already been inflated due to the carnival taking place and guests were later told they would not receive the normal level of service by this time many hotels were sold out or their prices were rising the music was ridiculously loud and unbearable the rooms should have only be offered to people attending the party who would not be disturbed by the music breakfast on the sunday was a food parcel which was less than adequate this was not a comfortable stay or experience when i mentioned it to the staff management the next morning they were totally unapologetic and claimed it finished hours earlier than it actually did
