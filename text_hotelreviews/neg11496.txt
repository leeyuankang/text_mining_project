i was a little disappointed that the sauna was so small and i was a little alarmed about the light floating in the pool that had come loose i reported but the staff were fully aware and was in the process of getting it sorted out and although my room was lovely and clean i did see a pair of pliers that were left on the floor by the lamp that i luckily avoided stepping on as it was almost hidden by the curtain i also ordered breakfast to my room where some of the food items were cold so that was a little disappointing too but overall i had a pleasant stay
