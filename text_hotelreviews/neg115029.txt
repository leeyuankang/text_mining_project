a couple of opportunities for improvement if i may it would have been nice if the shower had a handshower along with the standard showerhead also for whatever reason i was unable to use my french styler in the bathroom i could plug it in but it did not heat properly fortunately i could use it in the room and as there were plenty of mirrors it was no great trouble last thing my partner requested a high gloss gla age polish for his shoes which proved disappointing
