facilities are all a bit sub par for a star hotel breakfast was good but only continental breakfast was included it does not specify that on booking com and the hotel did not explain on check in either as a result if you get eggs which i did it is or euros extra when i pointed out on check out that it was never explained that breakfast was only partially included the staff apologized but did not offer to remove the charges also rooms are modern but the ipad controls only work some of the time pool is fine but small and the hottub is more like a lukewarm pool with jets unfortunately for the price i have to say there are better options in paris
