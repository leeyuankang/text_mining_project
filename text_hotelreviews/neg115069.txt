do not select the room with breakfast this is the most disappointed choice that i ve ever made during this trip the breakfast is soooooo sad i saw comments that the hotel manager made saying that they already improved their breakfast i was hopping that when we arrived the hotel will at least have some improvement because of all these complains but the breakfast is incredible over priced it is totally a ripped off for euro per person you get five kind of bread of them are toast with different oatmeal taste pretty much the same and juice that poured from boxed juice that you can easily get everywhere the mix fruits is the same every day you can t tell them apart from canned fruit they are cubes and watery there s not even any hot stuff if you want egg that s an addition which is a joke to me a heavily carb based unbalanced breakfast for of us for days is euro this is ridiculous you can easily get a lovely meal at a fancy restaurant for this price the service is also quiet miserable i saw the waitress pouring juice from boxes and get coffee from automatic coffee machine there s not much to do really but you still get your hot drinks over minutes of waiting and one day the table next ours got their hot chocolate thick like jam even they are already waited for a long time they have to send it back and wait again the breakfast is not making any sense for me i m willing to pay for the price but at least serve me something that s acceptable and please improve the service i booked two rooms with two twin beds since we are a family of four it was pretty clear written on the booking information some how they left only one room with twin bed it takes quiet a long time to check us in it was probably the longest time that i waited for since the hotel only have about less than rooms because of the bed situation the staff tried to make it up by upgrading us to larger rooms
