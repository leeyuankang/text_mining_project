there was nowhere to pull up to and unload the luggage the ac didn t work and the staff kept making excuses about why the front desk wasn t very honest about several key things first when we tried to see the catacombs they offered a service to help skip the long line we waited hours for the tickets which never showed up we arranged for a taxi the evening before but when we went down to go to the airport there was no taxi they said minutes that turned into we ended up hailing a cab ourselves i am sure it was forgotten it was very disappointing for a hotel in that price range i will not recommend it or stay there again
