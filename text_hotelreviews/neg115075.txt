room was incredibly small which was disappointing the breakfast was also disappointing it is a continental breakfast coffee croissants fruit salad etc but if you want anything else like eggs you are charged for it i found this to be very cheeky for a hotel at those room rates my husband ordered avocado toast which was literally a single small piece of toast with some slivers of avocado for euros we also had a very disappointing experience in that the air conditioning did not function in our room and it was over degrees outside so it was difficult to sleep and extremely uncomfortable we were not happy with the reaction we had to escalate several times before being moved to a different room with functioning air conditioning for our last night again for a hotel this was not acceptable
