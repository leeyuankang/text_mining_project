a number of items false advertising the bathrooms did not look like the picture there was no bathtub in fact we were advised by the hotel that only superior room has a bath tub and double baisen clearly they should not use this as the example picture incompetent service lengthy check in delays constantly asking staff to clean our flooded bathroom asking after each shower no response to an enquiry about the bath tub until i followed it up as an apology they put a bottle of champagne in the minibar but didn t tell us it was there and then actually billed the champagne to our room which we didn t drink or know existed even today i have been holding off writing this review as i was awaiting written feedback from the hotel and was hoping to give them the benefit of the doubt a number of other reviews have dealt with the breakfast and i have nothing further to add it s nothing special we have had such an upsetting experience here it is a shame hopefully the hotel can work on customer service its advertising and plumbing issues and move forward i have never written a negative review before but our stay ended on an upsetting note and we have received no correspondence today as promised
