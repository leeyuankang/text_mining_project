this is definitely not a star hotel the management is false advertising breakfast is not included in the price of the stay only a continental breakfast is included so unless you want to eat croissants and bread your entire stay at this hotel be prepared to spend euros for a couple of eggs each person family euros adds up after a week in addition to the for the week a sofa bed was also supposed to be part of our room and when we arrived the woman at front desk said no not the deluxe room i am glad i printed off the booking com confirmation all these details including breakfast included were written there the general manager said i am embarrassed the restaurant is in complete disarray they try but come up far too short no room in the restaurant either had to wait a few mornings to sit
