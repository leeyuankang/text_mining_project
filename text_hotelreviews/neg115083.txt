the bed was too soft and the duvet and pillows were of poor quality the pool is very small and only chairs to rest i didn t get that from the photos the massage rates are one of the most expensive ones i have ever seen anywhere in the world the restaurant opens at and closes at queues at breakfast the included breakfast is just a contenental one so don t get too excited stayed there for a week but couldn t eat a lunch or dinner at the restaurant either fully booked or closed and in one occasion that i manged to get a table i was told there is no english menu and when i asked the waiteress to help me to translate and order food she was so unhelpful pulling faces and so uninterested that i gave up and left not the service to expect from a star hotel i was better treated at the local bistro
