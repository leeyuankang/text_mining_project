i wanted to give the hotel a perfect score but during our very early morning checkout the front desk staff less experienced i guess could not cancel the pre authorization on my card after spending like mins in the end i had to switch to a card with a much higher fee and we were much late for our car service i was told somebody will reach out to me regarding to the inconvenience but nobody ever did anyway
