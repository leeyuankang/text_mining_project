the hotel only opened in early december and it feels some way short of stars especially on service management training and discipline are lacking so staff seem chaotic and bit dazed both at reception but also in the spa and especially in the restaurant service at both dinner and breakfast was very very slow and haphazard they re working hard and trying but there seemed to be a general lack of training and awareness of what star means at least in an international context hotel has amazing potential didn t like ipad controls for lights and everything in the room give me an old fashioned light switch any day
