there is no aircon in the room although i double checked and it was actually not specified in the room facilities you would expect it in a star expensive hotel the room was really tiny and without room for two luggages breakfast was dreadful and i ve eaten it just to feel full for the day but not because i enjoyed it the swimming pool and sauna were the reasons i chose the hotel instead of other options but don t get in this trap the facilities are very very basic sauna very tiny and if you can find another hotel with bigger rooms and nicer breakfast go for it and forget about this hotel
