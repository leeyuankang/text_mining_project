booked a double bed room and ended up with twin beds went back to reception to be told there was no other rooms then they found us a double room which was horrible right next to the train line and big generators as a view the room felt more like an hostel than a hotel room back to the reception we went demanding a refund but then we were offered the best room in the hotel a suite for night which we accepted but had to change in the morning we was then moved to a double room which was adequate for night the pool was also closed due to maintenance one of the reasons we decided to stay here for it felt like just because we found a great deal we were put in the worst rooms is not just pocket money will not be returning to this hotel
