the room was not big enough and not adequate for two people there was no room to go around the bed so that i had to get over my partner to reach the bathroom the a c was down so that we have been sweating the whole night bathroom was extremely small there was no minibar i had to purchase x mini bottles of water form reception not to die of thirst of a liter each at the cost of gbp the safe box was down as well overall a complete disaster i will not recommend the stay at this hotel to anyone i will never go there again
