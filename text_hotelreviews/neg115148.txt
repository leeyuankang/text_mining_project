i m wondering how this hotel is rated stars rooms are very small very average breakfast i paid the full stay in cash they removed the first night and after days i still didn t get my money back every time i ask them they said that they contacted their bank and refund will come soon be sure to get a room with ceiling fan and ac because when the ac stop working they say that ac is not included in the booking not very close to any underground station
