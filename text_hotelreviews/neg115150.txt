the staff here ruined my experience in london completely they were rude dismissive and didn t care for customer service whatsoever our shower had no running water so i called reception and they said maintenance would be there within an hour hours later and they still didn t call me back so i went to the lobby and asked what was going on because i needed to shower and leave the hotel for my flight and the lady at reception hadn t even called maintenance i asked if they could just give me another room i could shower in and she said she would ask and let me know within minutes i waited in my room for another hour and she never got back to me eventually my friends and i couldn t wait any longer because we would ve missed our flight so we did not shower and checked out and left when i came to check out the lady at reception asked so did u find a solution to the shower situation and i had no idea how to respond because not only did they not care to call maintenance but they couldn t even give me another room or even call me back to let me know what was going on the staff here are definitely incompetent and i would not recommend staying here unless it s only for a quick one night stay
