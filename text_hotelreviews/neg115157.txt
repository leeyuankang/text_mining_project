i fail to see how this is a hotel the room was cramped big cracks in the sick carpets stained and shredded chairs in the dining room were stained and dirty whilst there we were also not advised that construction work would be starting in the next room at monday morning which we were not pleased with all in all this was a complete nightmare stay and frankly not worth the money we paid we will not be staying here again absolutely shocking hotel
