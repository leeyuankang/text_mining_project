air conditioning didn t work only a few channels on tv no itv or channel when complained told that we had a ceiling fan and that the air conditioning didn t work in the whole hotel i rather think it was on a timer so it didn t work to save money this was billed as a four star hotel and it certainly wasn t and the price reduction was from a night i paid for a twin room which was not a price reduction i think that was what it was worth
