i booked a double but was put in a twin when i asked to be moved i was told the room size is the same i explained i would like a double bed so was moved air con is in the rooms but doesn t work although an electric fan was supplied however it was during the heatwave so it just wasn t enough so i slept badly due to the heat restaurant only serves breakfast there s lots of places for food nearby though but not ideal if like me you re uncomfortable eating out alone swimming pool changing rooms are just a hanging curtain next to the pool
