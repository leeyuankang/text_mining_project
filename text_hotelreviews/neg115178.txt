start to finish everything a room where you have a metre of floor space air con units fitted but hotel policy isnt to switch them on food was aweful of the staff there didnt care less you so that in their customer service what made it worse is i travelled with my year old and even she said it was bad looks a lovely hotel from the outside but needs a complete transformation in my opinion
