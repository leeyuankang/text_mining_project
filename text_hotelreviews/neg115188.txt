we only chose this hotel for a business trip because they had a triple room available when we arrived we were eventually told that there was a problem with the room and that we would need to share a bed or have separate rooms on the same floor which for three women isn t ideal the hotel didn t attempt to contact me in advance of our arrival to let us know however after some discussion the issue was eventually resolved and we agreed to take a family room with a double and sofa bed which was adequate we also received a partial refund and the staff were apologetic so it wasn t a disaster
