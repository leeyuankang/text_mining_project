room was cramped and directly over rail tracks trains passing all the time floors boards in the room were very noisey floor boards in the room next and above us were very noisy we could hear everything said next door to us air con was broken there was a fan in the room but it just pushed around hot air window had to be closed at night to drown out the noise of the trains not a modern hotel bed was clean and comfortable bathroom was very small but clean and shower was good good location but the room was not worth the price at all but that is what you get in london room was ok if all you were there to do was sleep in it and get out early for the whole day not a place for couples
