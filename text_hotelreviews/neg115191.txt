i tried to call the hotel weeks before travel on a saturday it was permanently engaged then i was left on hold and finally when i did get through i was told to hold the line ahd eventually put the phone down after waiting i mentioned this to a number of staff but they just said sorry the other thing is my night in london was june and the hotel took the full amount the day after i booked it which i think was a bit harsh especially as every person who was checking in the following day i spent a number of afternoon hours in reception paid at the desk on the day
