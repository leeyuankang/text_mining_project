the room had an insect infestation it was extremely dusty and not very clean i certainly do not agree with the star ranking of this hotel my room was changed the next day as the manager was not available on the first day i did not get any apology and the cleaning unit did not attend the breakfast was certainly not vegetarian friendly the sausages are placed next to egg and other options and hotel visitors mix the utensils when serving themselves the staff had real difficulties in understanding my issues and never picked up the phone
