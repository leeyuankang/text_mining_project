the bedroom was very small and was only just a single not double as booked the bed was extremely uncomfortable and left no space to move around there was an issue with check in where the room we were booked into was not ready and so we were put into the small room i was asked for my passport which confused me as i am english the receptionist gave us the barest of information referring to a scrap of paper trains were passing the room so could not have the window open due to excessive noise
