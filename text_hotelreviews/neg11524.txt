no where to put let alone suitcases except floor or lounge housekeeping was a bit hit and miss cups and glasses not always cleaned replaced and carpet not vacuumed once in days the restaurant was terrible we were made to feel belittled because we didn t have a booking webpage just says come and join us no mention of need to book when we could see spare tables for what we received the food was overpriced small portions and my salmon caesar salad was just a hot piece of salmon dumped onto lettuce with the barest hint of dressing croutons or parmesan cheese quite tasteless
