when making the booking i was given the opportunity of making a special request as i was travelling with my son i asked for a room with two separate single beds which we didn t get on arrival the staff at reception was not even aware of our request we insisted and got what we wanted the next day but not via your services i have had this three times now twice on a nairobi booking where i asked for an airport transfer which was simply ignored your system only talks about deals all day but should concentrate more on satisfying the client s needs in this case the hotel did dispose of rooms with twin beds and could easily have accommodated our request from day in fact your system sucks as you are not giving the client priority in satisfying his specific needs
