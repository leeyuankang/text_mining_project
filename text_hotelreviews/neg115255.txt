the room was not the one advertised on booking com when we complained to reception about this they did nothing our room was right next to the underground train track and the noise levels was awful this also was not mentioned in the booking com ad again the staff on reception did nothing about getting us another room some of the staff had poor english and knew nothing about local area we spent weeks in europe staying at all sorts of hotels and this one was by far the worst we had come across
