in the evening i have noticed there was no water from the tap first of all when it happened i was not informed about it and when i rang the reception they kept telling me to wait for half an hour as their maintenance team is already working on it for hours after hours of not being able to use the toilet i finally went down to the reception and complaind about it and the receptionist told me that she can only do and say what she was told to i get that but that should not be the response first she should have apolosiged about the inconvenience any way i was offered another room the following morning when we checked out again there was no apology what so ever i know this is not a star hotel but there is no harm in having star service it doesn t cost any extra money but the effect can be surmounting
