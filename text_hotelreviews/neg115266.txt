this hotel is in need of a major refurbishment and i hope they have it booked in the calendar soon the carpets were worn stained badly and in some places stuck down with tape and this was just in the main reception area the paint was coming off the walls breakfast wasn t really anything to shout about either limited selection but the hot english breakfast was limited to bacon that had been there all morning scrambled eggs that were not worth eating and i wont even mention the sausages this hotel could be amazing but the simple things are letting it down needs attention rapidly
