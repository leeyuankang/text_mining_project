when we arrived we walked up to the gentleman at the first desk pod and said we d like to check in he pointed towards identical pods to his right and said reception there was no way to know which one he meant no signage and at that moment no one behind any of them we then saw a woman return to one so went to her and checked in the room was small and badly laid out could barely walk between desk and bed and could barely pull out chair enough to sit down the floor of the bathroom floods when shower used these are new rooms food was served in the basement as temporary measure while refurbishing badly photocopied menus and ill tempered staff we left and found somewhere local to eat though quite tired
