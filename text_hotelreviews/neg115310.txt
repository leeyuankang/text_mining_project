the hotel supposedly has stars that might have been true years ago but not anymore the interior is very dated and it s not as clean as i hoped i chose this hotel because it was cheap and it had parking it turns out that the parking is just on the road and there s no guarantee you ll find a spot when you do you have to pay around to be standing there an entire day
