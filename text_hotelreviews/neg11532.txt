i did not enjoy the quality of the food in the breakfast eggs fruits nothing tasted really fresh and i wanted to have a cappuccino but it was not included in the breakfast rate they only give black coffee and the worst thing during my day stay was the fact that one elevator was not working so there was a long queue to take the lifts
