cooked breakfast was mediocre and selection incomplete no mushroom no cooked tomatoes the scrambled eggs were inedible and the quality of the sausages poor in the hotels defence the continental selection looked entirely satisfactory but that s no good when you want a full english the room was adequate functional and sparse my room was next to the lift shaft so the motor could be heard throughout the night a friend of mine stayed same nights in a room on the floor and his comment was that my room was positive luxury compared to his which doesn t sound good this hotel is ok if you are a one night stayer but i would not stay there again for multiple nights
