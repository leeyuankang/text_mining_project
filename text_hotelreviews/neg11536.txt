there was no hot water the air conditioning in the room didn t work so it was very warm wich made sleeping difficult there was a long queue for breakfast about a min wait to get in simply because the breakfast staff weren t re laying empty tables quickly enough the restaurant was no more than full and had more than enough empty tables to seat the people queuing there was still a queue when we finished breakfast and by that point the room was about full there were a few staff who were wandering around doing nothing until unless somebody else told them to do something we arrived at breakfast around minutes before it stopped by this point there were no fried eggs no mushrooms and no toast that seems inexcusable how can you run out of bread unless your planning is terrible
