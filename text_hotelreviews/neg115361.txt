this is a very very shabby hotel the carpets were threadbare and a definite trip hazard especially in the main lobby reception area and on the stairs there are very small trip steps in the corridors that actually caused me to fall many times the last time i injured my hand and asked to make an entry in the accident book what accident book i was asked that says it all health and safety need to take a close look at this hotel for hazards also the bathrooms were very small if you were over you would not get in the bathroom
