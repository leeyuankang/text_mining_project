very inflexible with our booking on booking com website i added what i was looking for in the search bar stating a room for adults and one year old child it offered the rooms available at this hotel and having given the criteria i assumed the search would only reveal rooms which were suitable for me thinking it was suitable else why is it on the list given my criteria i clicked and gave card details booking was confirmed however i thought i had better check that this double would be suitable and i politely requested a small put up bed for the child as it showed a double room on my confirmation the hotel said no so i politely requested an extra pillow and duvet so we could make up a little bed on floor hotel said no i enquiries why not health and safety very very inflexible booking com appealed for their help with my booking no luck i also spoke to manager she refused and refused to let me cancel as i was within hours of arrival date booking com were very helpful and couldn t understand the hotel s inflexible approach to my booking which was done in good faith and on the assumption that a little camp bed would be offered never assume very expensive hotel for what was offered decoration tired in places breakfast very average cheap marmalade and jam mass market stuff coffee and tea from vending machine all in all poor disappointing really as a little more flexibility would ensure a happy customer not so
