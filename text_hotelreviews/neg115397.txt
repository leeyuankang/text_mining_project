inside the hotel is very run down staffed by uninterested clueless spanish staff with a very poor command of english the dining room is located in the basement and is airless and hot the food on offer for breakfast was appalling hot food served barely warm with a broken down hot drinks machine cheapest cereals and sliced bread provided the bedrooms are very spartan and the provision of basic toiletries virtually non existent it seems as though the owners are using this hotel solely as a means to generate revenue without spending a penny on the building or its amenities this is a great shame as it could be an excellent place to stay
