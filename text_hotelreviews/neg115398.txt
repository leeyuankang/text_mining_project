i couldn t work the air conditioning unit and the room was very warm i experienced the same problem the last time i was there i was woke up around by a loud gushing noise like something firing up which then continued to drone on quite noisily ovens boiler my breakfast wasn t that pleasant i didn t like the cereal choice so opted for scrambled egg which was like rubber i had breakfast at so it should have been quite fresh the croissants were very hard and dry
