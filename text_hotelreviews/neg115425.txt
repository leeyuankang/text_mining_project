the rooms were old and tired as was most of the hotel they were very very small and the air con unit didn t work the hotel was very dated with carpets that looked like they had been there since henry last visited i honestly can t understand why this hotel is classed as a star as the swimming pool must be tidal with the tide mark that surrounded the pool that come off when rubbed with your finger i ve had warmer ice creams than the what the sauna was i didn t feel at all safe in the lift and expected at any given minute to plummet to my death with the rickety old bone shaker of a lift they have better lift facilities going into a mine shaft this is literally one of the worst hotels i ve stayed in and travelling to london on a regular basis from now on i ll stay in a travel lodge very poor all round
