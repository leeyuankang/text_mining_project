the staff was extremely rude and with a real bad knowledge of english they barely understood english the one receptionist informed us that the payment took place before our arrival and we did not owe anything and the next day a rude girl in the reception informed us that we had to pay the full amount and no payment had taken place moreover when we request from the reception a taxi they said that they order one but the taxi arrived half an hour later and when i went to reception to request to call the taxi again they answered to me get a black cup taxi from the road finally in the bathroom s sink there were brown stains that i had to clean them by my own when we arrived
