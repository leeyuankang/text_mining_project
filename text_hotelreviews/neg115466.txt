we were given a key to the wrong room and proceeded to walk into a room which had people s stuff in which could have been very embarrassing for both parties if the people had been in the room at the time we were understanding with the staff and didn t make a fuss when returning to the hotel the next night our keycard had stopped working on our lock so had to go and ask them to fix it luckily we were on ground floor but if we d been on as per our original room it would ve been very annoying asked if we could cancel the second night as our plans had changed told a flat no by front desk staff it was ok but i wouldn t stay here again
