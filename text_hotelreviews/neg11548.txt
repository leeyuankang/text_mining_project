the hotel is being renovated large areas are closed off and there is the associated noise and dirt associated with construction work the pool fitness area is only available at an extra cost and was quite dirty with evidence of a large amount work still needed the lifts were hopeless we stayed on the top floor and only of the went to all floor which meant getting from the lobby to the room could take minutes the fire alarm was broken and sounded a number of times in the night ruining any hope of a restless night
