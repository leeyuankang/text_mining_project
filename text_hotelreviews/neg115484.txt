the breakfast rates as one of the worst we have ever had in a london hotel the food items though plentiful were not fresh when we went to eat at the bread roll s and pastries were both too hard to eat we even had to queue to press the button on the drinks machine for a hot drink the water was not hot enough to make a cup of tea and the coffee was lukewarm you are clearly not catering for the british market
