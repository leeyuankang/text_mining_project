the staff spoke some english but it was not their first language and often simple questions received odd answers or none at all the hotel also appeared to be home to some refugees who refused to respect privacy and were loud despite us having a young baby trying to sleep even after we asked them to be quieter breakfast was ok but cleanliness and the decor left a lot to be desired
