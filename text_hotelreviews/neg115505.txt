the air conditioner didn t work as it kept beeping and giving an error message so i switched it off thankfully a working ceiling fan was available i did notify the front desk when we checked out to raise a maintenance ticket for its repair the tv was a luxury but it would have been really good to have had uk morning news but as the reception was so poor on the only available channels we watched the uk news on the ipad
