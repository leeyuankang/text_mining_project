staff need more attention to detail for example reception didn t ask have you stayed before breakfast is downstairs in the restaurant bar area and at breakfast they took my room number gave me a table and that was it i would have expected them to ask if i knew where everything was rather than feeling you had to fend for yourself i am harsh but have worked in catering and expect a decent standard food provided for room service is appalling brakes congealed tomato soup and walkers ready salted crisps no bread roll was cheap and nasty and charged for the pleasure of it i feel if you are going to offer room service do it properly also room service was advertised between and when i rang i was told it wasn t until no apology given after it took me six attempts to order as the bar didn t answer if you want to provide guests drinks and don t have the catering staff put in a mini bar i had a cupboard in my room that was a perfect candidate for conversion the menu was mostly drinks which says a lot it made me wish i had gone and bought something from sainsburys could do with a refurbishment i stayed in and the side of the bath was coming off no carpet in the rooms and makes it feel cheap advertised as but feels budget if i compare to other hotels i have stayed at no gown or slippers provided for use of spa facilities reception should warn you of this and how to use pool etc
