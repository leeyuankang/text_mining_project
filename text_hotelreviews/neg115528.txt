i booked a double room but the bed was size so not a lot of space room was quite small and at the back adjacent to the exposed tube lines so noisy trains late night and early morning more like a single room than a double the people next door woke us up when they came in at the hot buffet breakfast was cold as it had been out for too long the whole thing was a disappointment and not like our previous stay some years ago i wouldn t go back
