even though the booking indicated payment only once there the hotel took almost half the booking value a week before without notice when following up they acknowledged that this was not standard procedure and would reverse the money not realising that further losses would occur due to exchange rates very poor and unacceptable the breakfast is basic whilst the hot portion thereof is not up to scratch i e powdered eggs canned mushrooms etc the lifts are scary to say the least and it is concerning that they are operating under those conditions although there is a sauna it is never hot nor even warm it is a non feature and should perhaps just be removed or closed down even though the hotel is non smoking there is significant smoking within the hotel and nothing is done about it all in all the hotel is not value for money and should rather be avoided
