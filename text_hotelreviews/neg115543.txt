on the first night we were given a room with two single beds room put together even though we requested a double bed the room was dirty and the bed had bed bugs could not sleep all night next day we changed rooms and moved to which was definitely much better what i disliked about this hotel was the staff especially the manager very unhelpful the hotel charged me twice for the same room and they were unwilling to refund me saying that the reservation was unrefundable which did not make sense as i had already paid it once and was staying at the hotel cleary i showed up for my booking the manager who did not speak good english did not care at all that we were customers and started yelling at us for a mistake that it was theirs i had to contact booking com to resolve this situation and receive my refund of more than pounds also a day before my trip to london they contacted me saying that my card details were invalid and that they would cancel my reservation meanwhile my card was fully charged i had to be with them an hour on the phone so they could find the credit card slip and see that i was already charged very unhappy such a shame that this hotel is run by incompetent managers and supervisors
