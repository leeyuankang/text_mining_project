the only down point which ruined the start of our day and made us regret booking the hotel as we mainly booked because we could have a morning swim was the fact the swimming pool seemed to be running a toddles swim we went in for half an hour mins during that time toddles had a lesson each one absolutely screamed the house down we normally swim for an hour or so but left early as a child choked so much he was sick spitting water up it wasn t a good start to the day we also wanted to use the sauna but parents were using it as a baby change it was horrible listening to babies choke cry and scream it wasn t on the agenda i believe the hotel should book baby lessons in after as most guest will then head out for the day and at least be able to have a relaxing swim also the instructor had his sister and brother in law in there it felt like we shouldn t of been there despite the fact we paid to stay in the hotel we felt uneasy with the constant children and stares from people it was not a nice experience more like a free public pool then a private pool in a star hotel and is the only thing that would make me not book again
