i have had problems with this hotel with regard to taking money from my son s bank account without authorisation they took money out twice before he even went and it was a fuss to get it back but on checking out they took a further over and above the sum due on talking to the staff and manager they were extremely unhelpful and told us to contact his bank my son who is from scotland was left stranded with his girlfriend in london with his bank account wiped out i gave it as a gift and am really angry they still haven t refunded the and i am taking this further i was also horrified to read the latest statements on trip advisor where they are taking unauthorised payments they are a bunch of crooks sorry to say such a shame the lovely hotel ran by them
