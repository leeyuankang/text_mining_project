the d cor was drab and grubby the photo s on the website must have been taken years ago the aircon didn t work in the room which left a small radiator for the only source of heat the cleaners left the window open so on return the room was freezing the breakfast was of average the bacon and sausages were obviously a very cheap brand the eggs only offered scrambled were like rubber all in all a very disappointing stay i will not be returning
