the receptionist was extremely helpful but other than that the hotel is more like a star the supposedly superior room was very cramped carpet stained and floorboards creaked non stop the curtains didn t close properly and the view looked onto someone s bedroom the television did not work and as my room adjoined reception i could hear music and people coming and going i returned to the hotel in the evening and there were several make guests drinking outside this gave the impression of a dss halfway house certainly for a lone female guest not at all reassuring about safety breakfast food was cold and generally school dinner like a woeful experience
