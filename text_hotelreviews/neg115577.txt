there were some cultural differences i think arising from the fact that the owning company is spanish as most of the staff seem to be one as i have seen in another review that whilst there is a hot food selection for breakfast sausages scrambled eggs bacon beans every day that food though good quality was no more than luke warm i asked if there was a bar and was told it was open from until when i went there it was the breakfast room was in dimmed light with one attendant at the other end of the room she came to see what i wanted but didn t speak a word of english she showed me a drinks menu and i managed to buy a drink but i don t think that it s what most uk people would expect when they say they have a bar
