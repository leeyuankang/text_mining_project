scrambled eggs were awful but in general the breakfast was quite good and lots of it the carpet on the stairs is very warn especially between ground and first floor we requested a room on a high floor but unfortunately were given a room on the first floor looking out on a roof other building but we were only staying for nights so didn t ask to change it was just the ordinary double room that we booked anyway
