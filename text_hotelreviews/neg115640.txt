in all my years of travelling and staying at hotels i have never in my life written a review i was so shocked by this stay that i cannot stress enough how awful it was do not stay here fellow travellers in rating itself as a star hotel i think the establishment missed an s in it s title this hotel is much more like a hostel had i known it would be a dump i would ve been happy as my expectations were managed i cannot believe this hotel hasn t gotten away with rating itself as a star hotel my studio flat in london seemed palatial in comparison and having thought i d treat myself to a hotel stay in my city i couldn t run back to my place fast enough their mantra should be we don t do it here we don t offer room service they don t offer room service on weekends did you get that on weekends zero room service instead they shoved a take away flyer under a guest s nose saying they should order take away from a local place and hope they deliver we don t do space the room is equivalent to a private hostel room the bed shoved in one corner with a tiny desk next to it and one window my companion and i literally had to walk out of the room to allow the other in to say the rooms are tiny is an understatement we don t offer hand soap yep no hand soap had to use shower gel to wash my hands in a bathroom the equivalent of a toilet stall we don t care that you have mistaken the tv for a cctv camera the flat screen tv is so small that you miss it the first time i d have taken a tv from the s rather than strain to see a picture from box that is smaller than most people s laptops we don t operate working lifts yep no lift in a star hotel we had to take the stairs we don t provide deck chairs or towels their basement pool is ok but they only have deck chairs
