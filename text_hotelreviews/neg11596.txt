during our night stay the fire alarm went off times in the middle of the night once in our first night and twice in the last the noise was deafening and sleepy people in night clothes came out to the corridor to see if there is a fire nobody even apologized for false alarms and poor sleep quality when we checked out although nearly each suitcase comes with a producer s warning that it should not be lifted by using the pull handle the luggage storage guy lifted the suitcases only that way and was really arrogant when i asked him not to two functioning elevators were far too few for a hotel of that size staying on the floor we experienced it every morning that the elevator that was heading down to the ground floor was already too full when it reached our floor having started from the by the floor at the latest it was impossible to enter the elevator so make sure to ask for a room on the highest floor we could not find the stairs to use them instead no idea how we would have found our way out if there indeed would have been a fire
