it was very expensive for a large but not terribly luxurious room no air conditioning but the real disappointment was that the car company that the hotel booked us on to the airport cheated us i suspect he forgot perhaps deliberately the machine for credit cards we were out of cash at that point and had only us dollars for which we were charged a very high rate of exchange and the driver was nice but kept taking us off the motorway along little streets very odd
