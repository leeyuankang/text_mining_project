we were initially put in a room underground where the wall paint was falling off the bathroom was so small that a full grown adult could hardly stand under the shower barely any light entered the room and overall it definitely did not meet star standards at a request with the manager we were then relocated to another room which was much more okay however be aware that quality might greatly vary between rooms
