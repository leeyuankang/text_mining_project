the connection between the room and en suite was a bit unconvenient since they were connected by the entrance and both had separate doors there was no way of leaving the room door open it was quite a heavy door and no light switch in the entrance either the ventilation is not that great really one morning i was woken at am by a fire alarm that turned out to be a burned toast from the cellar little dining room my whole room smelled of burned toast for several hours and not only that day but every monring really just usually not as strong the served breakfast in in another building which on a first day is a bit tricky to find the breakfast in general was allright
