goodenough club is a great place to stay if you have as i often do work to do in the bloomsbury area the rooms are simple but clean and comfortable but prices are high much higher than they were a few years ago for something that is rather less than a hotel it s good that a basic continental breakfast is now being offered in the basement area where there is also a computer for guests use but seating is limited i can never quite face the goodenough house refectory across the road which does offer a cooked breakfast
