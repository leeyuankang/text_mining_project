neighborhood could be too quiet for some people no shops no people in the streets i couldn t find a women hairdresser it wasn t clear that the breakfast was included in the room rate and that it was all you could eat my room was in the courtyard not on the courtyard but in it literally in a kind of glass bunker that was recently added on i would have preferred a view out on the street where there is a garden but something about that being a downgrade something i was not really left with a choice i would have been happy to pay the same price whatever happened to showing people different rooms so they can choose
