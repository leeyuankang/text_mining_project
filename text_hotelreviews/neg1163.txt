the place is designed by someone who thinks design is more important than comfort by the end of the trip i found the walk along the very long corridor to my room was almost painful the room was ridiculously dark it was a big room but with one small window for that reason alone i would never stay there again the air conditioning could not be turned low enough to make a difference almost every night i was woken up because it was too hot to sleep even on top of the bed the staff did not say hello to me once and i was there for five nights the cost was extortionate given the pleasantness of the facility but it was then suggested to me that i had taken things out of the minibar which was untrue not to be repeated
