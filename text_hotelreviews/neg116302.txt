the room was freezing and it took some fiddling to get the heating to work one of the window latches was broken which meant that the window could not be properly closed i normally like to sleep with the window open but not when it is cold outside the window is three feet from the end of the bed and that it is the lower part of the window that won t shut i would happily stay again but i d check everything first and make more of a fuss with the staff to get things sorted out
