my room was located in a dungeon like setting in the underground level of the external rear of the building within a group of independent little blocks a permanent and loud noise from some conditioned air machine i supposed ruined my sleep it felt like i was on a cruise on top of that the room had wide windows and apart the feeling of lack of privacy the curtains were not sufficient to retain artificial light to come in at night overall i did not feel comfortable the wi fi signal was really bad absent in my morlock room breakfast was served in a different building across the square but once there no signs lead the way
