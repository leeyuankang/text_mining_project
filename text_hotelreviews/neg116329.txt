it is more like collage accommodation than a hotel my room a courtyard view was from the next window sleeping with an open window in a poorly ventilated space was like sharing a room with another person it is totally over priced for what you get and the service is reactive it was a really bad experience i will not recommend the place to anyone the rating is probably obtained from tourists that might think it is a historical site but it is definitely not comfortable business accommodation the way it is represented on booking com make it as if it is on a garden with a old style charm but this is nothing like the perception they create with the photos
