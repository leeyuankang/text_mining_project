we booked months ahead and specified the room they assured us that would be fine i have stayed here many times over a year period in my case before but will never do so again when we arrived we were told that because our flight arrived late we were there by we missed out on the room that we requested and were put in an unsatisfactory room after paying top dollar i was travelling with a young child and we were put on the floor with no lift on a heat wave night in a room that was because there is no air conditioning uninhabitable
