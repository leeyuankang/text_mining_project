we were told that there was no parking available and would have to book an ncp car park luckily we didn t book as there was off road parking right outside the hotel so given wrong info there then we were given a ground floor room as female guess we didn t feel comfortable and asked to change at which the guy at reception said to go look at the room did not want to change our room for us though the room itself was clean it had a terrible musty stale odour we asked reception staff to call us a taxi he said they would be minutes and it would be a black cab a private taxi pulled up and tried charging us twice what a black cab would charge so don t bother asking for a taxi at the hotel walk up the road and hail a black cab there we were told breakfast brunch would be available upto not the case breakfast finishes at breakfast is served in a completely different building a or so yards away weather was good so walking across was ok inconvenient if it s raining whilst the choice at breakfast is good we didn t appreciate having to share this space with rude students when you pay for a room you don t expect to be sharing a canteen with rude students who push in front of you whilst you are in the queue breakfast was cold no waiter waitress service wrong info given to us consistently and truthfully we wouldn t stay here again or recommend it for the price there are better hotels
