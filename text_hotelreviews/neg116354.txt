basic facilities and small room we had the standard one and you have to spend ages trying to find the hall to have breakfast in staff seem unable to direct you there as it s too complicated and they genuinely seemed uninterested and it turns out to be a student uni building down the road so be prepared to have a buffet breakfast surrounded by students not very good buffet breakfast unsurprisingly and no staff are around to help because presumably they just see you as another student the most bizarre and disappointing experience we got this place for a last minute big discount and that felt like poor value for money if we d paid full price we would have been very very disappointed
