i have been to this hotel on numerous occasions the hotel opened up a series of new annexes which are far below the standard of the rooms in the main body yet cost the same which is not little in short they got greedy and made a great and unusual venue into a modest and common one not really worth the money now too bad i really liked it before i will have to look for alternatives now
