the asian staff in reception in the morning is quite nice but the one who is in charge of the reception in the night is bad both in facial expression and attitude we only have a luggage but the moment he saw the luggage he gave us a obvious white eye and started to murmured about his backache we even not asked for any help if this is the attitude goes with a so call hotel i think the full score must be ten star
