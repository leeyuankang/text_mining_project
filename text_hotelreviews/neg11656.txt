the car park had been closed for building work meaning that we had no where to park the car i was not informed of this prior to our stay and this was one of the main reasons why we booked this hotel the receptionist brushed it off like it was nothing and told us to park in an ncp car park costing us extra in parking fees was not happy with this service at all
