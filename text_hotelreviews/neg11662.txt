very poor overall for money spent drilling started first thing in the morning room very expensive and dumped into non refurbished area lifts complete nightmare spent minutes trying to get lift to ground floor not impressed at all barely adequate room at ridiculously expensive price the bedrooms that have not been refurbished yet shouldn t be used as not up to standard or offer them at lower price very disappointed
