unfortunately the bathroom s flush wouldn t work the first night they couldn t fix it but we were able to use the toilet down in the lounge area the next day they immediately fixed the flush so it wasn t a problem for the rest of the weekend also the pillows are a tad lumpy but the bed is fantastically comfortable
