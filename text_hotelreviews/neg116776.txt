i was booking for a group all of whom had to pay for their own accommodation on departure i had a number of issues explaining this to booking com and had to provide my credit card to cover all rooms there were too many people that i dealt with instead od one person dealing with my booking i had to explain the situation to a different person each time the bedrooms were very small and felt a bit like a prison cell black surround to the bed and grey walls the rooms were very noisy if another guest flushed the toilet or had a shower the pipes would make an awful noise
