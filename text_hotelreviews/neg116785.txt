one thing i found in my room was that there wasn t a mirror in the actual room we had a full length one and a big one above the sink but both in the bathroom so when my friend was in there i couldn t use the mirror the room was fairly small but having looked on other reviews i think that s quite normal for paris there wasn t a great deal of space to walk round the bed and the bath wouldn t be able to be used as a bath by an adult but if like us it was just a base to go exploring then it didn t cause us any problems
