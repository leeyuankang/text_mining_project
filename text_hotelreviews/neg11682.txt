the female reception staff english speaking levels weren t great had to get them to repeat questions on a few occasions walls were obviously very thin because we had the room next door complain that we were laughing to loudly at however come the next morning their baby woke us up with its crying double edged sword really hotel isnt a close walk to a tube station nor is it located with any real tourist points of interest i personally dont care about that as im a londoner but i do feel its location is abit of a pain because you have to get a bus to the nearest tube if your not a fan of rain or walking
