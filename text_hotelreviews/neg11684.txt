we didn t know the hotel was undergoing renovations and when mentioned this to the concierge all he could say was that everyone was complaining about it and that it was on their website which we hadn t used to book they also said work was happening but on the second day we were woken before with banging and drilling which was so loud the bed shook on the first day we ordered breakfast they sent the wrong one and by the time we got the correct one it was cold and rubbery it was a pretty stressful and unpleasant experience all round
