first of all this is definitely not a four star hotel it is barely three stars i booked a superior double room and it was minute i can t imagine how small a classic double room would be the rooms facing the street are rather noisy they confirmed no double glass windows i told the hotel manager later why they didn t give me a quiter room to begin with as the hotel was quite empty to my amazement i was told i should have asked for it as some guests prefer the noise the hair dryer wasn t working so i was given a little hair dryer later on however i could use it only by sitting on the floor all plugs are by the floor the worst however was the cleaning staff knocking on my door at am the first morning despite the do not disturb sign on my door it turned out that the problem was the sign had fallen and the cleaning person didn t know what to do so knocked on the door i get that however having traveled all over the world i am surprised to see a four star hotel to have one single sign for don t disturb on one side and pls clean the room on the other side why not get two not thinking clearly lastly the credit card machine didn t work when i tried to pay however i was told my cards i tried two us cards both of which worked everywhere else were denied then had to pay cash later when i came back to pick up my luggage i was told the system was down at the time and they said they had told me this so i didn t have to pay cash but they hadn t told me any of this i found this a bit insulting as i work in finance and i can tell the difference between system down and your card is not working the saddest part was when i mentioned all the above to the hotel manager he basically said there is not much i can do as you are already unhappy w the experience i guess they would do something if i had been overall happy
