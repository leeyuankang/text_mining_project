in the bathroom there is no electric outlet in the room there is only one electric outlet that is not used by something else but when two persons are travelling we need to charge our mobile phones every day sometimes we need to charge other electric items as well there should be at least preferably extra outlets in the room and they should be placed in a convenient position not close to the floor
