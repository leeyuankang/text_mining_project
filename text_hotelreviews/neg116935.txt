terrible customer service do not stay here if you are a business traveller who needs to print we booked this hotel three days in advance and then asked that we could print if necessary a presentation in colour in hotel says of course no problem but only we then emailed them again to confirm that we would need the printer to print one sided colour slides they confirmed this and then said that we would pay per page a professional print shop probably charges less but we agreed in writing straight away you can guess what happened next no printer working and mad panic and dash to find a business centre not acceptable from a supposedly business friendly hotel very sloppy service
