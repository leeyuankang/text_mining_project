the housekeeping theived my sun glasses and the hotel didn t want to know about it they put the blame back into me and tried to make it seem like i took them out with me that day and they got pick pocketed i have pairs and i tried them both on that morning so definitely left them in the hotel i am a cautious traveller and keep all my expensive things out of sight or locked away the safe was tiny wherever i stay so to say i am angry is an understatement i worked hard for years to afford this trip and the sunglasses which i bought duty free before i went to paris they offered no apology but claimed they would contact me if they turned up they are never going to turn up it ruined what would have been a lovely stay in a quaint small hotel also it is definatley not worth stars you don t even get free bottled water i do not recommend this hotel
