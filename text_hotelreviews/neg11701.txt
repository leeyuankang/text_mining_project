we couldn t use the pool on both mornings because it was full apparently they only allow max of ppl and they charge you to use the facilities even as a hotel guest when we checked in they assigned us the old room which was outdated and the bed was worn down i literally felt veryigo just lying on the bed worst of all they gave us a room right below the renovation work so there were loud bangings drilling and sanding in the morning my old woke up in a startle from the banging and sicked my husband was fuming because the staff at reception wasnt very helpful until he demanded to speak to the manager who moved us to a higher floor to the newly renovated room
