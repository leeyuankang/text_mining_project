on arrival i was given a room card three times i had to return to reception as the cards would not open the door on the occasion prior to my third visit to reception i had telephoned from the corridor telephone and was informed a concierge would meet me at my room with a new card to open my room door i waited almost minutes for this to happen and then decided to return to reception where my room card was again exchanged and i was escorted to my room to ensure the card worked which it did at no point through this minute experience was an apology given for the frustration the hotel bar also looked tired and the bar tender obviously wasn t aware he could keep the surface free from spilt drinks or polish the wood to reduce its stickyness my colleague that booked the day prior also gained a better rate for his room by i use holiday as often as possible and usually have a very easy care free stay this occasion could have been better
