despite a check in time of being given we finally got into our room at this was after it taking minutes to find the hotel looked like a office building no bath towels only hand towels told big towels finished what does that mean of us to share hand towels after a shower on the hottest day of the year is not good no air con just a desk fan that was tiny hair dryer broken could not leave the window open to get air due to sirens all night this place should not be a hotel and to charge for the privilege is a joke not a happy customer
