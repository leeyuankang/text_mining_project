wifi wasn t working at all and the staff did not do anything about it i asked them to let me know whether they would be able to fix it and the lady i spoke to said she would speak with the manager and let me know but i have not received any answers after that it was really annoying as i was supposed to work which i obviously couldn t i understand technical issues happen but i d expect the staff to fix it or at least try to fix it
