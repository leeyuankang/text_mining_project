very rude member of staff at breakfast firstly it was noticeable that those who had breakfast included in their stay were shunted off to a side room which was far dingier than the dining room used for those who were paying extra for breakfast on asking a member of staff for some butter having been unable to find some on the buffet she rudely grunted that it is on the buffet and walked away the sauna facility in the spa was in poor repair especially considering the additional fee for use despite these minor grumbles the hotel offered great value for money and i would stay again
