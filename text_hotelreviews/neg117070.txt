very noisy even with window closed lots of emergency vehicles travel with siren on that road and very poor soundproofing no ac so if it s too warm either the heat or the noise will keep you up wifi signal was very poor and internet link itself was too congested there was no qos or bandwidth shaping so one user hogged all the bandwidth trash was not removed in days i guess you need to ask explicitly for maintenance no reading light
