to their credit they made an effort to make the place hospitable to guests but without truly seeing the room from the guest s point of view some of the issues included there were some pretty blinds in the window which did nothing to block out the blinding street lamp outside that was aimed directly over the head of the bed the sink was too flat against the wall and had a shelf over it thus i had to very awkwardly brush my teeth over the sink because there was no space to properly do this and hit my head on the shelf several times because of this also there is a very bright fluorescent light in the room but if you want to read in the evening then there is no lamp or less harsh light suitable for reading unless if you wanted to use the street lamp which shone directly into the bedroom location was quite okay except for the fact that the room was located over quite possibly one of the busiest streets in the night in london there were non stop motorists which i could get over but there were also non stop emergency services driving past flashing lights siren sounds etc and that went on through the night
