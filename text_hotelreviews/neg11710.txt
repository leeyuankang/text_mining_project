hotel staffs were not trained at all the receptionists were rude and did not have any qualities match to the hotel brand name holiday inn i called the reception because our heating was not working but she hang up before i finished talking i just could not believe it also the insite parking was closed due to the refurblishment but there was no information about it when i booked with booking com so we had to park our brand new car in the street around i made a complain when i checked in but the receptionist accused me i was wrong that i did not check holiday inn website that was very very rude of her saying and i was pretty upset if people book through booking com or expedia or other websites she should know not all people check their official site to get information in advance i was treated with almost all the people working there with no respect if you know what good service is because you travel around all over the world this hotel is not for you they are in london but they do not have mentality as british i recommend not to chose this hotel if you expect excellent service from famous brand name
