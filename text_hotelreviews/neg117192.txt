the personal at the reception was really confused talking to himself and seemed to bit unorganized the rooms are very small for a four star hotel for more than nights the rooms are too small to stay the elevator was under construction during the days of staying there so carrying luggage from the very top to the very down floor and upstairs in pretty narrow steps might be tricky if you re have heavy bags
