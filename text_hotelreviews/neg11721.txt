room service food wasn t as expected and varied disappointingly from menu ie chicken and bacon burger had no bacon mozzarella and pesto panini had no pesto might sound like i m being fussy but if you re dropping on a sandwich you least expect it to be right also the hotel was cheaper a night due to refurbishments but this meant being woken at on a sunday by loud banging and drilling that felt like it was next to our head we rang reception and they did stem the loud noises for an hour but was still a bit rubbish for a sunday morning even with the discount
