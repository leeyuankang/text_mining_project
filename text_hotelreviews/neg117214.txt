a bad start with an arrogant unwelcoming receptionist the lift was not working with floors to climb and i did not feel well the room was over heated and air conditioning not working unfortunately you can t open the windows as the hotel is on a high traffic avenue reception had no idea how to control the temperature nor did they make any effort to help except for shouting at us one of our worse hotel experience ever
