the doors are wafer thin you hear everything including it sounds like people in the hall are in your room the bathroom was oblong shaped and did not have a shower it was awkward and not relaxing to try and bath last the towels were old and thin nothing that you would expect from a star hotel let alone star they were really worn out and should have been replaced a long time ago would stay here for the right price if i liked to take baths and if i planned on travelling with my own towels otherwise would not stay here again last they have a policy that when you leave you must leave your key at the front desk we are not used to such a policy at any other hotel and it was a bit unsettling to do so though nothing appears to have gone missing
