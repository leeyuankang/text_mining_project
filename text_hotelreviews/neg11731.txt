the bar staff were not very friendly the toilets for the foyer bar area and restaurant are in the basement which is too far away cost of wifi is ridiculous in this day and age wifi is generaly free everywhere i was thoroughly disappointed to see this hotel charged for such a basic service this would definitely make me think twice about staying there again
