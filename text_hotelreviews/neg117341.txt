our room was rather small not sure if all are like this but you expect to be bigger at a star hotel there were some on going construction activities inside the hotel we were not announced about this and one morning we were woke up by the noise made by the workers it wasn t a big deal as we had anyway to wake up and start the daily tour through the city it s just that we were not announced about it so we adjust our schedule accordingly going to bed earlier so we wake up earlier and of course during such a period a compensation for customers is expected
