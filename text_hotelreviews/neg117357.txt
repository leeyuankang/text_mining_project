the staff was unacceptable especially aylin we were precharged for parking and by the time we arrived they said they no longer have a parking place so they sent us to another one for which we also paid the problem is we still didn t get our that we had prepaid and it s been weeks since our stay aslo a week before our stay they had sent us an e mail telling us that there had been something wrong with the payment but the bank said they had already got the money weeks ago nothing like that has ever happened to me before and i am traveling a lot they still haven t paid me back for the parking they don t even have barcelona is amazing just choose another hotel
