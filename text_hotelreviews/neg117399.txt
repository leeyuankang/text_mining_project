when booked through booking com i expected to pay over the counter when checked in but the reception told me the payment was already through i was not allowed to settle by other means like gbp cash or another credit card as london is my last stop in europe i did a lot of shopping during my stay days nights in order to reduce luggage weight a few old clothing and empty shopping bags were left in the room when i checked out to my surprise i was being charged for one more night for the little trash i found this totally unfair and unjustified
