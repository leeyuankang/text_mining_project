we got a room with no air conditioning the maintenance man said the motor needed to be replaced so they moved us to a different room which made us late for an appt the other room they moved us to had air but then during the middle of the night that stopped working also we were incredibly hot but did not ask for another room as that then would be our third room no guarantee that room would be any better my brother sister in law did have a room with air conditioning had no issues
