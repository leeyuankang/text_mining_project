staff attitude especially when the dining area was booked the staff in restaurant did not want to do much but just inform me it was booked for dinner so no seating the hotel does not exclude the management of the restaurant from the hotel the hotel gives guest the impression its all a convenience then when you get there the bar is different and you cant get proper food from the restaurant brought to you at the bar if by no fault of yours its booked i was forced to eat light dinner when i was very famished
