for some reason the hotel had received identical bookings through booking com for two rooms when i only wanted one i only have one showing on my account therefore some technical glitch must have occurred this did cause me some stress but hopefully the hotel has sorted out any misunderstanding i paid a premium price for saturday and certainly did not want to pay twice
