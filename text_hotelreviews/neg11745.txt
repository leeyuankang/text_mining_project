we arrived to be greeted by a very grumpy receptionist who despite me assuring her i had followed all the procedures and requested a newly refurbished room as part of my booking kept barking at me that you had to pay more our friends who were also staying at the hotel followed exactly the same process paid exactly the same and got a new room we were not asked for a swipe of any card etc so then struggled to get anything in addition to the room room service was a joke we were woken at by the smoke alarm and when we asked at breakfast how this had happened we got waved away by the staff as if they were trying to keep it a big secret the icing on the cake was the my husband paid for a bottle of sparkling water from the hotel shop yes our room didn t have any hot drink making facilities or water in the room so we needed something an absolute rip off and a horrible hotel with a dreadful approach to customer service do not waste your money i have stayed in many many hotels in london which have in some cases been cheaper but in all cases had a much better experience absolutely will not be staying there again neither will our friends
