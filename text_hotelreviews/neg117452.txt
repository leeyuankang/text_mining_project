i couldn t find a mirror near an electrical socket so i had to look at my reflection in the glass of a framed picture on the wall when drying my hair our room was a nice sized corner room however it was next to the lifts so we could hear those until very late and from early in the morning other than that it was very quiet and we couldn t hear anything from other rooms there was a strange gassy smell in the bathroom briefly first thing in the morning but this cleared once i started using the shower
