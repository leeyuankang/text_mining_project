on my arrival at pm the room was not ready and we were told to wait until pm this is in theory ok i know general check in rules at hotels but on the other hand this is my first time in life that i arrived at a hotel and couldn t get the keys so we dropped off our bags and went out we came back around pm and received the keys from the reception once we enter the room it was horrible they gave us most probably the smallest room at the hotel that has no view at all i had booked an executive studio and the room we were given was not that after endless discussions they gave us another room which is more like an apartment nice view but very old fashioned furnitures but this overall experience was very much frustrating for us besides the rooms i saw have no similarity at all with the pics on the web site i have been to london many times and it was my first time in victoria district i can say that there is nothing special around and all main london attractions are far away excluding buckingham palace the neighbourhood is not too bad but also nothing interesting last thing we wanted to heat the room a bit as we had a small child with us but the air conditioning was set to cooling only by the hotel
