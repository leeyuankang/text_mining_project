our room was a lovely executive studio unfortunately it needed a bit of maintenance as the window seal wasn t working so we had a lot of car noise from the road and the air conditioning was leaking so the floor outside the bathroom was wet and the power socket next to the mirror didn t work the hotel is perfectly located if you travel into victoria and there is a lot to see and do around there
