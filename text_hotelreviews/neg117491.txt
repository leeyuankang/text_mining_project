the hotel runs on heating and air conditioning but not at the same time it is all either one or the other which the hotel decides at its discretion so when i arrived my room was incredibly hot and the only solution was to open the window street noise below whilst the bar lounge have a very pleasant atmoshphere i had to join a queue of guests to be served as there was only one barman amd no waiting staff on duty at the prices being charged this was no where near satisfactory
