delay for the check in after a long travel we arrived at the hotel at pm but the room was not ready they asked us to come back at pm but at pm the room was still not ready we insisted to get our room and we finally got one tiring check in process the location of the hotel is not the better one in london we did not really appreciate it cold air flows in the room air conditioning issues too expensive bad quality price ratio
