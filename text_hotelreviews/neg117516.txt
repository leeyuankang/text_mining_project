i got used to grant the park plaza a straight point grading until i got my first and single time where i needed something from reception staff which was out of the ordinary i needed to leave day before the end of my stay i requested that days prior to the end dof my stay and the saga started sir you have to talk to booking com we cant do anything for you had you booked directly with us we may have been able to help went to my app and there it said contact the property for changes your booking is in the past u cant change it the property will answer your mail within x days thats too late went back to reception the next day was told that i was too late i should have told them before said i told them before ahhh sir you booked with booking com u should contact them i showed them where the app says to contact the property ahhh sir the booking com app is disfunctional still we cant do anything for you we will charge you for the night you will not be staying with us ummmm in other words we are unflexible ppl ummm not good i thought that would be easy since ive been in this hotel many times and i had the feeling they were flexible and would accomodate gladly a multi returning guest s rightful request as i thought naively sooo disapointed by this but still i gave a fair rating that does not reflect how disgruntled i am since other categories remain good not excellent any more
