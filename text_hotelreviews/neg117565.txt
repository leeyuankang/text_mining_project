i had booked and paid for a large double bed rather than a single as i don t sleep well in a single bed i also asked for a quiet room on arrival i was allocated a twin room where two single beds were made up individually and pushed together this defeated the object i went back to reception and the room was changed for another room less quiet but it had to single beds pushed together and made up as a king when you ask for a double bed i think you should get a double bed
