the staff were not too friendly no smiles no greetings i was only greeted once by the receptionist on our way to the breakfast and thats it we spent nights in this hotel the breakfast was identical each morning their system is not centralized as housekeeping was not aware that we have extended our stay on the last day as they opened our door for cleaning even with the do not disturb sign was on
