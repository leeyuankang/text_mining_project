whilst staying there was a fire alarm activation at all the guests vacated the building but it was apparent that the staff had little or no idea what to do i understand from another guest that not all fire exits were open accessible once outside we were gathered on a street corner spilling into the road there was one member of staff leading the roll call whilst others wandered round with a list surely having one member of staff designated for each floor would have made this way more organised quicker and would have provided guests with more information we were outside for approaching on a very cold morning and given the fire brigade were quickly on the scene it would appear that we the paying guest were basically outside in the cold whilst the staff poorly managed checking that we were outside the hotel is very pleasant and comfortable although the bed linen duvet was not designed for the bed provided whilst i would happily stay here again as it is convenient and very reasonable for central london i hope that the management will learn from the obvious lack of staff training regarding fire procedures
