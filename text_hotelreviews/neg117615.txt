paid a lot more for this as i thought it was the westminster park plaza not victoria when i booked because i thought i was staying there i arranged to have dinner with a friend at the westminsterpark plaza and the staff couldn t have been less helpful when i realised my mistake after i spent several a fortune on dinner they had availability but even though they are the same hotel chain they refused to swap me over i had no idea how to do that via booking com so late in the day so i went to the park plaza victoria hotel i had booked in error cost me another taxi fare so the whole experience left a bitter taste
