i booked my room late it was a double there were issues from the start the room was bitterly cold big windows corner room and the central heating was blowing cold air and there was no way to change it to make matters worse the knob for the water temperature in the bath was broken once i turned it cold water would not stop running they had to turn the water off in the whole room to stop it i had to go down to the reception and complain they gave me another room which was just great warm with everything working properly and my question is why did i not get such room to start with the staff must have known that the first room was not up to standard and still they let me have it
