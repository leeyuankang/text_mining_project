i stayed there for nights honestly the stay was not pleasant i booked a twin room but was wrongly given a double room at the beginning it happened more than once that the staff opened our door directly after knocking on the door for only few seconds and without asking anyone there in the room or waiting for us to respond we have pressed the do not disturb button and confirmed the light was on before we left hotel in the morning however we went back to hotel only to find that someone had entered our room and the room cleaning service was done
