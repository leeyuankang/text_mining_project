i was very disappointed in the room itself although it had everything one would require it was extremely dated the carpet was well worn faded the black out blind curtain was all frayed towels were well worn grey and thin and the bed linen was poorly pressed and bed sheets not pulled over mattress all crumpled the bath room fittings were all old too you could see the walls had had a quick paint as it was on the edge of carpets so not worth the money
