as mentioned below upon checking in we were given a room that stank of cigarettes despite our specific request to have a non smoking room on a non smoking floor and had some other weird damp smells we immediately notified the front desk who immediately apologised and offered to move us to a new room we were then upgraded to the executive suite which was a very pleasant surprise another problem is that the fire alarm did go off on two out of the four mornings that we were staying at the hotel which was quite annoying i think that it was probably due to some guests smoking in their rooms bathrooms finally while the room was clean in general the carpet remained dirty despite the daily housekeeping service for the whole duration of our stay we also felt that the bathroom floor should be thoroughly scrubbed whitened more often as it seemed quite stained dirty
