i had a very unfortunate event during my night stay went out and came back after the first night to discover all our belongings cleared from the room two toiletry bags and some clothing we moved here from another non ac hotel due to the heat we were assured by the front desk that we do not need to change room despite holding separate reservations the guest relations manager tried their best to recover our things the funny thing was some of the missing items were recovered and some not the missing items would make up the price of the hotel rooms itself i think the housekeeping department needs to give a full explanation over the matter it seems very clear to me they just help themselves over these things presumably left behind by the guests so don t hold your hope high on getting back any of your belonging left behind unintentionally it s a shame that such a good hotel is marred by perhaps one or two black sheep
