fyi i never complain as very easy going traveller this annoyed me though room was a slightly larger double not a club room staff just shrugged when i told them which for almost for nights was very unprofessional electric curtains didn t work without manually pulling which wasn t easy extra bed setup when we arrived so had to request this be removed electrical wire hanging out near iron board rubbish crumbs kids toys and shoes valentino s should ve kept them on floor when we checked in at so not early really disappointing as used pp frequently in other cities or things annoying but ok but all this and the blase manner of staff frustrating feel that hotels are penalising booking com bookings now due to discounts no direct email to contact hotel to raise issues
