we stayed once before and were very impressed so we booked again this time we were quite disappointed the bathroom was in need of refurbishment with broken tiles and mould in the corners of the bath on our second day we didn t get our room serviced so came back at to have to do our own washing up and make our bed the phones weren t working so we had to go back downstairs to reception to let them know and ask for some more tea coffee also asked for a quiet room but were woken at by the bottle bank being filled up repeatedly the manager was very pleasant when we checked out and complained and gave us a small discount but we would have rather had the good service and nice room that we had the first time we stayed
