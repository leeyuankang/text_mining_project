the hotel changed the locks on all rooms with no notice while we were enjoying the steam room and we could not get in our room for almost half an hour on our checkout day this was highly frustrating and required is to go to the lobby in our bathrobes to retrieve our new key the first of which did not open our door seriously then we were told that they charged by the hour for late checkout that is something i ve never experienced at a hotel
