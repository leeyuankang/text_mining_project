the windows weren t as soundproof as i would have liked but the street wasn t terribly busy at night so the noise was limited to passing buses and cars the suite we stayed in was a nice room but seemed lack proper maintenance the first night the lights in the main room would not turn off also the shower didn t drain leading to us flooding the bathroom and hallway judging by the damaged wood and carpet this seemed to have been a persistent problem the toilet also didn t flush well the repair crew fixed these issues the next morning the curtains also didn t close all the way leaving about a inch gap in the middle for the price point and past stays at the park plaza county hall and westminster i expected better
