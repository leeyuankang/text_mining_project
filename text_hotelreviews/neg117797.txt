the next room unfortunately i thought the rooms was soundproof but alas the man in the next room snored loudly really unbelieveable noise all night through i tried everything putting ear plugs in duvet over my head nothing helped great shame as i was going in the morning to the queens patron lunch and i needed the sleep i spoke to reception and she just said nothing they could have done about the noise but we should have complained at at night i am not sure i would have got anywhere at that time because snorers are snorers
