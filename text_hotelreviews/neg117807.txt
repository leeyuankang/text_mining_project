quite expensive for what it is even in london on twin beds the duvets are too narrow they move and drop away during the night the so called executive room is still small and doesn t have any kind of view the hair dryer isn t in the bathroom and can t be moved it s a huge hotel impersonal nothing really to dislike but in my opinion nothing to love either
