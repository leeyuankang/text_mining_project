we were in a room on the second floor on same side as wilton road don t take a lower level room on this side its very noisy as the windows are not insulated well buses in london run through the night and one hears constant noise of traffic we had trouble falling asleep but as we had already unpacked bags we didn t want to waste few hours asking for a room change which i doubt would have been possible on the busy easter weekend anyway check your bill as well we were charged for mini bar items which we had not consumed but the hotel removed them on request
