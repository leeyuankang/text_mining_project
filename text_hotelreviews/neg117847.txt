even if we lowered the thermostat on the air condition to c every morning when we went out there were something wrong with the air condition so it felt like going to sleep in a sauna everynight during night time and to open the window towards the busy wilton road was making inte harder to sleep with all the noise but that was the only option or swelter in the heated room we mention the heating problem when we checked out and the receptionist pointed out that it had been like that during a couple of days during the refurburation which i think should be one of the first thing to mention when we checked in also sometimes the water became scolding hot without us touching the thermostat water heater
