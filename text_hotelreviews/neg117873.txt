the new automated system for lights air conditioning and curtains was not working properly the lights and ac kept coming on by themselves when we were trying to get to sleep two staff members had to come up on two separate occasions to try and sort it out and eventually switched off the fuse so we then had no power in the room all night it was incredibly disruptive and had we been warned that it was a new system we might have been a little prepared we also had to move a heavy piece of furniture in order to get the kettle out of the cupboard lovely hotel but just a shame about these things as it disrupted a night morning and meant we were late going to a conference
