the breakfast foods were only lukewarm and the toaster was a complete fire hazard absolutely burned one side of one piece of bread but left the other sides uncooked the waiter said oh yes it s been doing that lately we don t know why how about take that device out of service before a fire starts we ate future breakfasts in restaurants or in the apartment at am on february the fire alarm went off blasts and then stopped i called to the desk and after waiting on hold was told it was fine to go back to sleep our year old son was very freaked out and had trouble going to sleep less than minutes later the alarm went off again but without ceasing and we had to evacuate the room we were out on the side walk for a long while and later some were allowed into the lobby presumably for warmth with the alarm still blasting my constructive criticism to the hotel staff was that it would have been helpful if they had assigned someone to instruct patrons what is going on why it was happening etc this is simply wise safety protocol when you are running a business i was told well there are only of us on staff right now so we couldn t do that when i calmly told the daytime manager the next morning that this was unacceptable safety policy and procedure he was receptive to my comments and we were upgraded to the bedroom apartment our son had a difficult time going to sleep the next night as well because he said that the alarms were going off in his head i was always taught by my father a professional engineer that signs off on fire safety blueprints in the usa that you should always study that evacuation map on the back of your door while you are unpacking in the room my son s suggestion was to tell everyone in your party the passcode for the room safe
