it took quite a long time to get booked in due to the fact that the hotel hadn t received the reservation breakfast was pre booked to get the cheaper rate but i was put off by the fact that food was cold and the fact that i found a hair on my plate id book the hotel again but would probably leave the breakfast the hotel is pricey but i got quite a good rate the staff are very helpful though it seemed unorganised in some respects due to them not having my booking and taking a while to get me checked in and also the fact that house keeping kept knocking on my door the following morning it was only to see if i was still there
