when we arrived and checked in we were told that our room was ready for us the room had actually not been cleaned at all when we got to it so we had to return to the front desk to complain they offered us a free drink at the bar to apologise for the inconvenience and about an hour later we were allowed to go up to our room bear in mind this is now almost hours after the official check in time
