my last two or three stays standards have dropped compared to other hotels in london mainly the facilities regarding the rooms rather than the rest of hotel the last stay i had a room which directly outside workers were in the middle of laying new carpets this left the whole area smelling of glue throughout my night stay the cost was iro gbp for nights so value for money it was appauling
