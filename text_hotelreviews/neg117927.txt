overheated room and air conditioning not operating in winter months so far too hot to sleep was told to keep window open but not effective to cool room and also too much noise from street should not be advertised as having air conditioning if this facility is not available all year round got the impression we weren t the only guests reporting this inconvenience some of the furniture was also quite shabby not worth per night offered discount for next stay but will not stay here again
