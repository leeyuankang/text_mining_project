the rooms are of a very poor standard as a regular traveller for business this would be one of the worst rooms i have ever stayed in this was listed as a star hotel and in my opinion it is no where close to this rating they have tried to redo the main bedroom to modernise them however this has obviously been done very cheaply and it shows the bathrooms however have not been touched and the taps were caroded and had green build up on them when you don t want to leave your toothbrush in the bathroom that says a lot about the quality and cleanliness very poor value for money
