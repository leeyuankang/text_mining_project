my daughter and i were separated while touring london on our own i came back to the hotel and was informed by a female staff that my daughter called to check whether i was back i thanked her and let her know that i would be in my room however the next time when my daughter called again she was told that i wasn t back it would have saved us a lot of trouble if the staff who picked up my daughter s call had duly checked by calling my room or with his or her colleagues other than this hiccup i am quite pleased with the staff s services
