the thermostat does not allow you to adjust the temperature over a certain level the first night was very cold and uncomfortable i did contact reception and they were unhelpful the next day spoke to the duty manager and was told that i should have been offered a heater by reception i was just offered a heater for the following night and it was left at that i felt they could have been more sympathetic when i told them we were unable to sleep through the night and ruined our plans for the next morning i felt it was just ignored
