the wi fi speed wasn t great but this didn t bother us much as we literally used the hotel to get ready in and sleep in also we did have to ring reception to help us operate the shower the shower dials controls were really stiff to turn my boyfriend had to do this for me so we thought we were doing something wrong this is just me being really picky those things were the only slight downfalls but it didn t ruin our stay i would definitely recommend this hotel without a doubt
