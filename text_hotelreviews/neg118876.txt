superior double room was small unremarkable and worst of all was on a significant slant not flat so you felt sea sick and disorientated first night slept poorly due to a constant bright red light and loud humming noise over bed staff turned it off for the second night which was great but then we recieved a o clock wake up call this was a mistake and was absolutely not requested above irritating me it was completely unprofessional so therefore i experienced poor sleep on both nights very very expensive even for central london and nothing to justify it breakfast extortionate but thankfully endless places to eat within walking distance staff were pleasant but will never book here again
