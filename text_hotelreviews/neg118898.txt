the bathroom facilities were not as mornern as i would expect for a hotel specifically the old shower head that didn t really give any water pressure also the windows should have been double glazzed both for a winter stay and to stop us from hearing the cleaners and other staff walking past the outside of our room we could have also done with more towels and toiletries for guests in room
