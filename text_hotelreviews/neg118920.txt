initially booked to stay at grange beauchamp hotel however upon arrival we were told they were doing some sort of work on a few of the rooms and we have been transferred to a sister hotel we wouldn t have minded but wish they had told us beforehand shower in the room was broken and the sliding doors were all broken so had to be careful floors very creaky so could hear people walking around all day and night the bed was the most uncomfortable thing about the whole stay really rock hard and there was very little chance of getting a good nights sleep the pillows equally as awful didn t help would have expected much better considering the price
