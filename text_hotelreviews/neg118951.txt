when i had been in the room for a little time i realised that there was a fan blowing cold air through perforated panels in the ceiling it was very cold and noisy and i would not have been able to sleep in those conditions the staff on duty tried unsuccessfully at first to switch it off eventually they managed to switch the fan off from elsewhere in the building but the hour or so that this took was not at all relaxing i was staying for one night only and this problem spoilt what should have been a relaxing evening in this otherwise lovely hotel it was good that the duty manager offered me a small compensation of a free breakfast which i was not able to take up but this problem needs to be sorted out before i would want to stay there again a pity as in every other respect the hotel is perfect for my needs
