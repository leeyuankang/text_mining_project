room is very small i know london accommodation is always on the small side but it was pretty crammed i would have thought a bar fridge would have been nice but as i looked around i really could not see where they could have fitted one however bathroom was a good size unlike other places where you almost have no room to dress within the bathroom mattress sagged transversely across the mid segment of the bed because the base of the bed was two segments brought together i don t mean two single beds brought together which would have been ok but bases brought together one from the head and one from the foot to meet in the middle it was very odd and i think someone with a bad back would have been in trouble because of the sag in the mattress where the two segments met
