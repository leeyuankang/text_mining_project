windows in bedroom bathroom are single glazed the old fashioned types and the window in the bedroom wouldn t close at the top so there was quite a draft coming into the room there aren t any drawers in the bedroom for storing clothes so all our clothes had to be bundled on to small shelves in the wardrobe or draped over the chairs etc there was of course a wardrobe for hanging clothes the room is quite spacious enough for there to be a chest of drawers for keeping ones clothes
