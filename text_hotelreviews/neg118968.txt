wifi was terrible there s free wifi and you could also pay pounds per day for premium wifi the free version requires registration and is automatically disconnected every hour or so this is really annoying also there was no socket near the bed so it was impossible to use my phone charge it lay down at the same time while my room was only a short walk from the elevator i had to go through different doors not easy when carrying luggage the location for the luggage was at the narrowest part of the room when you open your suitcase you can t walk from one side to the other unless you go over the bed i thought there were much better spots for locating luggage
