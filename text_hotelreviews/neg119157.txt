this hotel was way too pricey for what it offered plus we felt as though the staff was all about the business transaction when we arrived after an overnight flight they immediately sat us down at a table preauthorized our credit card for the entire stay plus an enormous security deposit of pounds then they asked if we wanted breakfast pounds for four and that was after the discounted rate for paying at the desk as opposed to at the restaurant we knew this was ridiculous but we were all exhausted and hungry plus while the staff certainly was generally pleasant it often seemed like we were the first people to ever ask them to do anything service wise we really wanted to like the place but it simply didn t live up to the cost
