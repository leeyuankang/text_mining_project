we didn t get a turn down service however i m not sure whether our room was on do not disturb or not though so it may not have been the hotels fault also the breakfast was a tad pricey but it was very yummy italian inspired which was great and we got it brought to the room at no extra cost they even managed to accommodate my husband s request of scrambled eggs which weren t on the menu
