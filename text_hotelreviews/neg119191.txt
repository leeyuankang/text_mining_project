staff on reception not friendly upon checking in i was asked to provide my card and enter my pin for an amount of when my booking com confirmation had said it would be for two nights i questioned this and was told rather abruptly that i wouldn t get charged for anything until i checked out i repeated that as i was a little confused by the price and also this method of paying and was hastily told something about pre authorisation and again told that nothing would be charged until check out later that evening after an issue with my card whereby i had to phone my bank i was told that had been taken from my bank by the hotel i questioned this again with two different reception staff the next day who before i could calmly finish explaining what had happened interrupted and very abruptly told me that the whole amount is taken on check in and held until check out upon check out i would be refunded the difference which i am yet to receive back i got the impression that i was bothering the staff who weren t happy to help and didn t even get a smile from them or what i felt was a genuine apology for the confusion i await the money that requires paying back
