when christina was off the gentleman on reception was surly unhelpful and rude he charged me which has never happened before and when i queried this he said i would get it back as long as i did not take the shampoo however i thought it was there to be used he also charged me three times on my card for the room which blocked my card and i had to wait a week for the charge to drop off not happy with his service
