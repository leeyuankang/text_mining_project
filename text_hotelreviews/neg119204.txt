we booked a rather pricey double room for nights we arrived at the hotel very late only to be given a room where we had open a number of fire doors walk lengthy corridors stairs up and even more stairs down imagine all this while carrying suitcases each one of us the room was clearly in a different building without a lift the walls were paper thin and we could hear those next door talking not to mention shutting their door i ll never come back
