we have stayed in many central london hotels and this was the worst value ever for per night we had a superior room with a shower room so small the wash basin was in the bedroom the mini kitchen only had a microwave and china over what any decent hotel room has the room was small and the double bed even smaller though clean there were holes in the sheets the heating cooling fan was so loud you could not sleep with it on best of all you could clearly hear conversations in the neighbouring room and when other rooms ran water it was like an express train rushing through the room i could go on but you get the idea
