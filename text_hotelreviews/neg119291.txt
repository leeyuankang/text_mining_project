what i did not like i told the staff at the reception that the shower head to the flexi pipe was leaking and they did not repair it within the two days i stayed at your hotel i checked for myself and it was only a case of changing the gasket the water presser was low so the water was running down the flexi pipe and you can imagine there was very little water to shower
