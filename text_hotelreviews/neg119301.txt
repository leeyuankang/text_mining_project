the rooms weren t as clean as you would expect from an expensive hotel maybe i am a clean freak but if i pay this much money i would expect the room to be specklessly clean also the size of the room wasn t clearly stated when i was booking the air conditioning was too loud the neighbours were too loud we could even hear them sneeze they probably heard us talk as well i also saw that on the hotel s website the same room was cheaper then the cheaper room disappeared so i cannot prove this claim but i recommend to check the prices at the hotel s website before you book
