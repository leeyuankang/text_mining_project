i was told no payment would be taken until i checked out i was preauthorised on my card and a further deposit which i wasn t told about they have taken the payment for the stay and im still waiting to get the deposit back which is my own money i even made the bed and left the place the way i found it i will never use the hotel or booking com again both are misleading to say the least
