if booking com had booked our room we had to cancel a bedroom and rebook a double room this was at least a few months before our travel got the confirmation from booking com that i had double rooms when we arrived at the hotel only room was booked and the other room was cancelled i showed them my confirmation and the hotel was great and booked us another room but we where floors away from our family i was very disappointed in booking com for this error but could not thank the hotel enough for sorting this out for us
