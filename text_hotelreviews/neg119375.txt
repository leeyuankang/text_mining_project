very old hotel totally overrated and overpriced they provided us with a wrong room type with very old shower with strange and unusual bath setup when we complained and asked for a change at the beginning they did not want to help and said all the rooms are the same but later we realized that the room is specially designed for handicapped guests when we insisted they changed the room generally things do not look like a star hotel but mostly looked like a star guest house don t get how it is ranked so high the guests were getting stocked in the elevator on the ground floor and receptionists had to come and open the elevator by a metallic tool happened to me twice and they were so relax and cool like it was their everyday routine all in all never again
