my only real complaint was that while they had a hair dryer available i couldn t find a plug for it in the bathroom so i had to sit on the bed i could still see myself in the mirror to dry my hair a bit odd maybe i just missed it and i admit i never asked the toilet in our particular room was very slow to fill back up and had a few problems with finicky flushing as well
