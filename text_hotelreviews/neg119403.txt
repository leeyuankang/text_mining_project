what the hotel don t tell you is that upon arrival they take a holding fee of the total amount they tell you the card details are just for authorisation of stay when you then check out the next day they duplicate the payment and the holding fee takes x working days to be released my advice if you are staying there is to use a credit card as opposed to debit
