very disappointed given the price poor facilities no bar so we had to get our drinks from the attached independent restaurant and walk through the reception to a badly designed seating area the bed was poor and uncomfortable the pillow only one each was so thin it was like sleeping on the floor the room was next to the lift so sleep was almost impossible because of the noise cannot recommend
