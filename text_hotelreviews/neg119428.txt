wasn t given any information regarding meals specifically breakfast which led us to believe breakfast didn t start until on the saturday so we went elsewhere found out from another guest that breakfast is served for guests only earlier down stairs it would have been nice to know this from the start of our stay to save us finding somewhere else to eat even an informtion poster or clearer information in the rooms would help
