the hotel staff at reception are just one step away from being rude they are not friendly or approachable the walls of the room are like paper due to the placement of our room we were surrounded by three rooms and i could tell you every word all the people in these rooms said had a shower put the hairdryer on when they left and returned to their room it made for a very uncomfortable night on our first night there as we were constantly being awoken by our neighbours who were doing something as innocent as flushing the toilet the beds and pillows were also very soft and i woke every morning with a sore neck and back
