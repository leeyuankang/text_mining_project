although cote brasserie was very nice and we had a good dinner there on our first evening breakfast was just too terrible by the lifts there is a notice that cote brasserie is open from early morning to late evening for breakfast lunch and dinner unlike the previous evening when we entered from the street wearing outdoor clothing this time we entered via the door from the hotel and as we looked for a nice table by the window we were hustled with downstairs please into the basement we go breakfast was just about over the buffet was depleted the waitress hustled us with i will leave it there for another minutes but we close at we had arrived at we had to make a quick decision me standing up as to our choice i ran back and forth from the buffet getting coffee juice etc as a team had already moved in to clear it the coffee was the dregs from a flask and cold we had half a cup each a little spot of juice i managed to grab a slice of bread each some butter and jam before they too were taken away the cooked plates arrived whilst my husband was still eating his cereal then they started to mop the floor as we left i notice the board on the pavement offering what we had just had for sitting in the main restaurant with views and no hustle enter from the hotel and then you pay even though they had almost stopped service and had set up for lunch
