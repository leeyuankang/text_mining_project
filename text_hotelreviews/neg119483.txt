we got in at midnight on the first day and i was given a room on the ground floor overlooking the road it was not great and i requested if i could have a room on a higher floor there was but it was at extra whilst i as happy to pay that for the next nights i suggested that perhaps since it was already midnight they could have just given me a first night free upgrade as it was unlikely they would get anyone for that room anyway it was declined and i think they missed out on a nice goodwill gesture at no extra cost as it was really unlikely they would be able to rent out that room at that time i have a poor impression of management at club quarters and unlikely to stay here or any of their other chains again compared to my earlier stay at citizenm which i highly recommend the staff and policies at club quarters seems made to squeeze out any bit of from you oh yes you also have to pay extra if you would like late check out after even if it s just to pm any other hotel would have just thrown in free subject to availability
