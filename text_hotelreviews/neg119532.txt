as my experience there the staffs weren t very helpful with luggage they don t help you carry it to your room to guide you around the hotel and where your rooms are as i had to find my room myself there were some major confusions at the check in as i had to pay per night as deposit even though i had already paid for the full price weeks before i came down to london to check in this wasn t explained on the website the staff who worked at the reception didn t speak english very well so more confusion were made
