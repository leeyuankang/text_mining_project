would have been nice to have cups as options for water machine too also clarity regarding deposit policy and more understanding from staff i arrived ready to check in and was terribly tired unfortunately i d recently had my bank card blocked due to fraud and awaiting the arrival of a new card which meant i didn t have a card to provide a deposit hold from i offered to give id but this was declined some more understanding compassion would have been appreciated i had to wait for my girlfriend s arrival to pay this deposit which was inconvenient as i really did desperately need to sleep
