i got stuck in the rain wearing my extremely expensive designer jacket i was pretty upset and i asked if there was a dycleaning service or anywhere i could take it the lady at the desk told me somewhat rudely that there was nowhere for me to take it because it was saturdaya d everything was closed and then proceeded to tell me that i could use the dryer in the laundry room i went up to my room and googled dry cleaners and i found at least that were open and close so i was a bit frustrated that she didn t even attempt to help me but i still enjoyed my stay and would definitely come back
