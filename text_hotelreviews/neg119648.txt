check in system is very unprofessional for a star hotel the system chooses your room and everything is done is a self services like system some may find this useful but it felt cheap to me the first room allocated was described as a small queen this room is definitely too small for two people and the bathroom is so tiny that you could probably sit on the toilet and have a shower at the same time i opted for an upgrade for pounds a night i was put in a suite on the floor unfortunately i was woken by rattling walls and loud noises from the neighbours the walls of this hotel are so thin that i could literally feel every movement of the very active couple next door i called reception to ask if there was something we could do they replied that they would speak to the couple and phoned me mins later to ask if the noise had stopped which it did not bearing in mind that this is am and if the noise had stopped their call would have woken me at i gave up on getting any sleep as the bunnies next door were still at it i left the hotel for a walk and upon returning asked the receptionist if we could do something about the noise or the room as i was not happy about not sleeping at all she said that their was nothing they could do about it i then asked if i could check out of the hotel and go somewhere else to which she replied that there would be a penalty for this i told her again that i was not able to sleep in the hotel and would rather avoid taking my chances by staying another night she told me that their was no management on site to make such a decision and that i could check out but had to wait until the following monday to dispute the penalty after further discussion she referred me to her colleague kristine who very politely listened to my complaint again and assured me that they would hate to see us check out because of this and offered me another room next to a regular guest whom they know to be quiet
