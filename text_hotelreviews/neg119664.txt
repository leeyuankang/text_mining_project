check in was awful reception said my card was declined twice but then it was accepted the third time now my bank account shows the transaction has come through twice i think there is something wrong with the hotel system but i was left feeling it was my fault finally at check out the receptionist was very helpful the room was so hot all the time that i had to open the window the aircon also just blew out hot air overall this was not value for money
