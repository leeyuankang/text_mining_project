bed covers were very very uncomfortable and i didn t like the style and layout of the room but this was simply because we were on the end of the corridor i m sure the rest of the rooms had a regular layout the bathrooms were extremely small and dated and the shower cable was very small and had no bath which i was very surprised about also beds right up next to window so all the busy traffic in this particular area left me and my partner up all night
