we had a problem with the water temperature the water was boiling hot and could not decrease the temperature since we were staying for only one night and we discovered it at am in the night we thought that maybe the problem will disappear in the morning but unfortunately it was not better on the next day we called the reception and a technician came to repair the temp controller but it took too long and finally we had to leave the room without taking the shower we wanted to profit from the city and not spend our time waiting for colder water the hotel did not make any discount effort we left paying the full price
