upon arrival you will be asked to pre authorise your credit card with an extra amount on top for alleged expenses that you might incur even though there is no minibar in the room this is a nonsense as the hotel has your credit card details and is protected in any event if you do not agree they will not register the check in reception staff were in don t care it s just my job mode this is a surprising policy for a supposedly higher level hotel it is far from a welcome to treat the guests as if they are potentially bad debtors in the interior it is a throwback to how offices looked in london in the the bed although described as a king size bed was too narrow for two persons sound insulation is non existent so you will have plenty of chance to hear lovers making love lovers making war children crying and the cleaning ladies cleaning aircon is a noisy ancient system that continues for minutes after you switch it off but you will need it to stave off the chilblains there was a table stand only on one side of the bed normal practice would be to have one on each side as a final bit of context i have never before given a negative review and have stayed in hundreds of hotels but st paul s club quarters will not get another visit
