location right next to st paul s so all good there room clean and adequate no thrills but did the job sky sports on tv so bonus as didn t realise it did have no condiments in room communal ironing board and very noisy at night in the corridors as the rooms are packed in very close together probably didn t help having a group of women crying in the hallway but tough to fault the hotel for that reception staff lukewarm and slow to check in and out
