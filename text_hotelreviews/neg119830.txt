i booked this on an offer for a night instead of more than i ve been to better hotels in london for less than what we ve paid and the room would never be worth the so called standard queen room was a very standard double room with cheap carpet floor and a bathroom that reminded me of a gym instead of an upper storey room we got one on the ground floor where the main view from the window was the wall of the building the wifi didn t have any password protection so didn t seem too safe to use considering the price tag and the very positive reviews we were expecting something much more luxurious
