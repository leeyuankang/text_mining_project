the corridor to our room had a smell of sick the bed was hard the fruit sweets etc wasn t stocked until the monday morning when we left they only had biscuits which after a long day a cup of coffee with a biscuit would have been nice but the biscuit barrel was always empty at the end of the day only one lift was working on the sunday so we spent ages waiting for a lift and in the end gave up and took the emergency exit
