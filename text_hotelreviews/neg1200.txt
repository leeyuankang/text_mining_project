when staying in a deluxe room guests have use of the club lounge except in our case due to the free upgrade i thought this was a bit mean spirited also we were awoken at on our last morning by maintenance but reception staff were unsure why however they offered us a free upgrade with their sincere apologies the next time we book with them
