the absolute worst check in process ever i mean why would any hotel request to write down my credit card number on paper and claim that they ll use it in case i use anything from the mini bar they then said it is a standard procedure around the place which i ve never seen anywhere around the place if you don t want to give up your card number then be prepared for a long conversation at check in
