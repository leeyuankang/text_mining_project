i was charged euros for the minibar charges incurred on the night of our night stay at this hotel we were charged for a bottle water chocolate now onto the best part we did not even know that a minibar exists within the room apparently it is hidden under the work table which we rarely use i was told of this minibar charge while checking out on our last day and minutes away frm our ride to the airport i told our receptionist that we did not consume anything within the minibar especially since we did not even know that it exists the receptionist opened the log and insists that we must have taken the items from the minibar in order to save time and effort i slept for hous the night before we had a morning flight i paid the euro for something we did not consume at the end of the day it is not the amount that counts but the way we were charged for something we did not consume be it or euro this most certainly left a bad taste in my mouth for the hotel i have asked the receptionist to re confirm with his staff about the minibar and hope that the management can respond here about this matter
