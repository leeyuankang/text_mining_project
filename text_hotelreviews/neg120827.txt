we were made to wait for hours because they have a policy for check in at pm so even though we arrived at the hotel at am they did not give the room despite it being ready vacant after hours the person at the reception told us that he can give a room earlier if we pay half price of euro i was with my old parents we were made to wait from am to pm before he gave us the rooms this was despite me booking the higher category of deluxe class rooms the gentleman at the reception was most curt with a care a damn attitude the afternoon shift lady was very sweet helpful when it came to giving local tips on sightseeing etc the normal rooms are very dark n dingy and tiny but do have the basic amenities in the room bathrooms overall if you can walk a bit mins or so everything is within reach for comfort sightseeing etc if you re looking for a comfortable luxurious place for the kind of money that you pay then this place is definitely not for you overall
