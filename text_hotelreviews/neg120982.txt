we inadvertently booked two rooms instead of one we had to pay the full amount as the hotel made no attempt to rent out the extra room in our confirmation email the two room booking was not mentioned they also got the date wrong and has us booked in a day early which i did see and draw their attention to the shower drain was also blocked
