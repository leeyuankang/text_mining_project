although it has been mentioned that there is a lift in hotel the lift works from the first floor and should take stairs from ground floor to the first it is better to be aware of strict rules of this hotel about credit card i had a reservation and although they had charged me before my arrival they wanted me to show the credit card for check in since i did not have it with me the receptionist wanted me to pay the whole price in cash and returned the money to the credit card which i used to reserve the room i had no choice because the withdraw had already been done and reservation was completed without cancellation they claimed that they had already announced me when they sent confirmation email to me but i found it later as the last sentence which was written at the bottom i have traveled to many european countries and stayed in various hotels where my passport was sufficient and i had never had such a problem in check in sometimes i saw that glasses and cutlery were not quite clean at least i could see the water mark on most of the spoons and knives
