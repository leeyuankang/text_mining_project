the rooms we stayed in opened directly into the very small breakfast area and kitchen the preparations started at am even with the very good sound proofing we were woken up felt very strange opening the door to people sat next to it eating their breakfast city view it was a building site not a city view breakfast small selection right next to late night take aways arriving late at night the children found it a little daunting given hotel was not clearly signed and lots of people around drunk waiting for their kebab the reviews all said staff were helpful but we didn t find them to be as helpful as they were to the french couple checking in before us parking is not included and is around the corner at euro per hours this wasn t clear during the booking process
