close to the train station therefore a lot of homeless and cheap eateries not very pleasant the entrance to the hotel is meters wide and located between doner and chinese imbiss the receptionist didn t help us a lot with a parking just took money and gave the envelope with receipt and wi fi code the window was on the street and it was very noisy they should change the omelette it is awful the ac minimum temperature is that is very cold but without it there is no fresh air because you can not open the window overall overrated hotel but quite good
