unfortunately there were several things we did not like first it was cold in paris the night that we arrived in the hotel f c we arrived to our room to find the window wide open and the room freezing cold there were cigarette butts on the window sill obviously someone smoked and then tried to air out the smell it took hours for the room to warm up again the thermostat in our room did not work until the front desk reset it for us second the shower had a noticeable smell i thought it was cleaner but my fianc thought it was mold though everything did look clean third the room is most definitely not sound proof we could hear the street traffic a tv in the room next door and people in the hallway we stay in paris twice a month at different hotels each time and soundproof rooms are insulated from this kind of noise and often even have two layers of windows our room was in a small hallway with only two other rooms so it wasn t like we were next to the elevator or a central meeting space where this might be more expected to be clear i don t think the walls were especially thin but to label the rooms as soundproof would be dishonest fourth the wifi connection was so weak we could not use it at all we booked this room last minute and got a very good deal eur but even with this benefit we cannot ignore these other issues
