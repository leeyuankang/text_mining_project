the room was huge i booked the deluxe double but the closet was still just a foot or two wide with four hangers despite the sq footage of the room i still had a full week s worth of clothes all over the place it doesn t make sense to have a room that size with big empty space and no closet space for longer stays there was also a huge brown soaking wet stain in my carpet outside the bathroom all week which wasn t cleaned up despite my call to reception i was told to wear slippers and put a towel down instead also the worst internet in france it kicks you out on a minute timer and you have to log back in with a user name and password not at all practical for a work trip
