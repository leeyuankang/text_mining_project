the housekeeping staff were not consistent when we arrived we didn t have conditioner or body lotion the second day we did but they didn t restock the tea coffee or milk the third day we got two bath shower gel but no conditioner and also no milk but we did get tea and coffee the key thing this hotel could improve is a check list for housekeeping so everyday the room is made up identically and consistently
