i think the hotel needs some small maintenance such as new iron and making some fixtures secure but these details really are small the rooms are small but big enough for what you need i wouldn t ask the hotel for a taxi back to the airport as you will receive a really nice car but will be more expensive then a meter taxi who have a fixed airport faire but if you would rather have a really nice private car then it s the best price you will get due to the special deal the hotel have with uber
