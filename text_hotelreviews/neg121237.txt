well after i had made this booking on your website my credit card was compromised and then i had to update my information before travel with my new card details it was confirmed that the hotel had my new details when i arrived they did not and would not accept my new card they even asked to look at a bank statement obviously that wasn t going to happen on my side so we had to cancel the booking and make a new one they were less than happy with this and said they could not do anything as booking com had not sent the new information who knows but it was frustrating then we had a leak in our bathroom coming from the ceiling and the same receptionist the next morning when i went to tell them seemed to feel i did not know what a leak was and practically laughed at me so when we returned hours later the leak was still dripping and the bathroom was flooded so i called maintenance and they looked then we were moved to another room immediately not sure what she was thinking when i said water coming from the ceiling of our bathroom all in all the rest of the staff were very nice and the hotel was pretty comfortable i guess she was just an exception also a set of headphones were taken while we were out and about and when i told them at reception they said oh thank you
