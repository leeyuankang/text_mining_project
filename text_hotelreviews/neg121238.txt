there was smell in bathroom everytime when we took shower seemed like they have problems with they plumbing system hair on the floor in bathroom and dirty carpet bedside table was broken and you could see it as walking in to the room charged a night deposit huh so we dont take anything from the room question was there anything to take by the way they said it will be automaticty refunded back to the card but on actual check in i was told it will be refunded to the card by a team member end of day after ny check out still nothing in my bank account reception staff being sarcastic most of times small lift and room attendants with unhappy faces like we need to get out from the lift just because they have more important things to do in general small superiour room and i would recommend hotel looks a bit worn out lobby and bar design nice stylish but plain at the same time seems like something is missing at the bar we waited untill bartender finishes his sigarette outside then we got served straight after he went back to continue his chat with other team members dont even bother to try connect to wifi it doesnt work we stayed on floor and it has no wiev more like a loft small apartment rather than a hotel
