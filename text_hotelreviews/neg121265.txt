before we arrive at this hotel we sent a request message while booking for nights weeks ago which was we have a little year old girl and we need a quiet room for my family and for keeping our little girl feel safe and comfort when travelling she will sleep with us when we arrived they asked for extra euros per night and gave us a room with a extra sofa bed on ground floor and we found we couldn t sleep because of the subway noise every minutes we had to request to change to a quiet room and one man of their staff lying to us that there was no subway nearby we insisted changing the room and they said all the rooms occupied and we had to suffer the noisy of the subway at the first night they finnally offered a top floor room for our second night after complaining to their manager for our experience please avoid the rooms on ground floor
