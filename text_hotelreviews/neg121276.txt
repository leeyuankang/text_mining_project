the room is extremely small they must of used graphic to show these luxury rooms however this isn t the fact as you can t even walk between the beds and the walls wasn t clean the carpet and no shampoo in the bathroom extremely poor service you can find much nicer for this amount of money and i would rate this as a star hotel
