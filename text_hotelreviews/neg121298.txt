the noise is unbelievable the walls are made of boards so you can hear every thing in the corridor and the rooms i was able to feel the vibration of the next room cell phone while am in bed this is tooo much the corridor is almost wide so you can feel people moving around and luggage being dragged i stayed there for nights and it was the worse ever cuz seriously you cant sleep at all the noise starts from or am till the night also the rooms are tiny and small you cant even move or ask for an extra bed this was not the size that was displayed while we booked
