the hotel in under renovations at in the morning you can hear drill bits the metro runs straight underneath the hotel and you can hear it every couple of minutes would not recommend if you re a light sleeper the key card to my room was stuck and the whole mechanism needed to be replaced the toilet was not cleaned before i checked in for the classic room it is much smaller than what you see in photos they make you leave a euro guarantee when you check in that they don t tell you in the hotel page
