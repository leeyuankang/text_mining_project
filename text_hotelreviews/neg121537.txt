noise noise and noise once again we got a quiet room facing some dumpster better than facing the street and i mean it but extremely thin walls made us hear everything i mean absolutely everything couple upstairs having romantic moments or using toilet neighbours moving their luggage neighbours talking to each other people walking on corridors also there was some shouting in the middle of the night included in the package deal that woke us up nights out of people were shouting from floor below us and we could hear them very well very poor facilities no bar no really waiting area no nothing staff they were not bad they just did not care we had the fastest check in out in the world and i do not mean it in a positive way we got zero information about hotel facilities if there are any breakfast etc we just got a room key and wifi password another thing is how the receptionist lady checked if our room is ready she basically started yelling like crazy to somebody upstairs and after several shouts she got confirmation that the room is ready yay our room was cleaned although we left card saying we do not wish it to be cleaned
