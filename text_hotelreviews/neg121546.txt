the hotel was too expensive for what it offered inconvenient elevator very small and slow if you have luggage this is ok for a cheap hotel but not for e per night breakfast in the basement also without any daylight this is too expensive very dark room hard to work there for business because you need the lamps and the light of those was not bright and rather dark loud traffic even if the windows were closed you could hear the cars and the street was very much frequented with cars
