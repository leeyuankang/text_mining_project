for the first time the rate of the hotel at website booking com did not reflect the real situation first il is definitely not a stars hotel forget about it no standard of stars hotel not even stars in many aspects the room was extremely small even for the paris standards and for sure it was not of the sq m surface what was promissed during the booking some of the rooms are bigger but we have got a really small room which however the receptionist defined as bigger that the others the entrance to the bathroom was right in the middle of one side of the bed and only from it so it was very difficult to step or move there the bathroom was the smallest i have ever seen once the door was closed it was very difficult to open the door to enter the shower or even simply to turn around the more so the decoration of the whole room was very dark the wall stores on the windows the floor etc what made the room even smaller in our room the predominant colour was violet which in some countries is a colour of the mourning we asked for another room they promissed to do something but they did not do anything despite of the fact that they had at least one room free that night which was bigger but as it was a room for persons they did not decide to upgrade us leaving us unhappy in our room then they decided to resolve the problem the following day but it was never happened they gave up this problem and never come to us again with the solution or justification we stayed the whole stay night with the room being far below the standards expected from the booking com site to summerise we did not like at all the decoration of the hotel the main hall is not nice the main entrance to the hotel is even worse similar like in very cheap hotels the corridors are also very dark all that is very depressing
