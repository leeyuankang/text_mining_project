bathroom was nice and updated but tub was too high which can cause getting in and out difficult specially for older people also the glass shower screen was small and didn t seal completely every shower ended up with water on the bathroom floor we had a problem with the key card to the bedroom every single day we stayed this was due to a malfunctioning set of cards sent to the hotel even though this was annoying staff was extremely helpful and accommodating
