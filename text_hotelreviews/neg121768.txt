while still centrally located what i would consider outer circle and excellent tube access it was a little bit of a trek from central sights for quick long weekend trip to london other trips to london i ve stayed more central where i could walk everywhere at the nadler we would take the tube and then walk everywhere after careful research however i couldn t beat the price for such lovely accommodations so it was worth being a little farther out
