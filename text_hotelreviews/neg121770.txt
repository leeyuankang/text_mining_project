not particularly friendly welcome or helpful for a family arriving quite late at night after a long flight delay unfortunately from there we only noticed the negatives there are some physical challenges for example all the stairs and doors with suitcases to navigate and the lack of breakfast service on reflection a okay hotel for couples or solo travellers
