very tiny room no where to store our very large suitcases so we were tripping over them constantly the bed was a little small but still enough room for a couple disliked that it was pushed against a wall so one person had to climb over the other to get in or out on the whole it was a nice experience and the minor negatives did not outweigh the positives
