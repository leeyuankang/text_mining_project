the staff was great super friendly the room was clean and quiet and had everything i needed the housekeeping staff even let me sleep undisturbed i know rims in london are generally small but it was a little smaller than i expected the mattress was a little too firm for my taste i had difficulty sleeping and woke up a little sore
