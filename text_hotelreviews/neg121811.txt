not sure if we had been forgotten but i asked for our room to have some attention e g the windows to be locked wash liquid to be placed in the kitchenette and the air extraction in the bathroom to be looked at as it didn t seem to function it didn t seem that any requests were carried out we stayed a couple of nights this time probably an omission but still i have given nadler top marks in the past but this time was disappointed i had high expectations and have recommended this hotel to colleagues and friends finally please use a different cleaning material when you come into reception its smells like dettol weird
