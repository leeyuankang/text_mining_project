the bed was really hard no good for anyone with a bad back i didn t sleep much at all the first night and although i have rated other features favourably i would not stay again due to bed comfort i stayed at the holiday inn at manchester airport weeks ago the comfort was amazing and slept really well which is important when you are away on business
