i stayed at many hotels in and i never wrote a review before but because of the appalling stay i had at this hotel i decide to rate my experience which was horrible first the room was booked for someone else whose name were on the screen but they gave it to us for some reasons we didnt get second the room we had was freezing and we couldn t increase the temp at night the wind was below through the window like ac never had night like this before in all hotels we stayed in and what made it worst is the staff were so rude in the next morning when we asked them if we can get one night refund because we left the hotel second day even though we paid for two night unbelievable experience so bad
