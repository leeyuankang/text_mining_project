we received a room in the lower level we didn t open the curtains since there was a car parked directly in our window the rooms had beds we were people it was very difficult to move a very tiny table it was really not comfortable during the day and it was not a cheap hotel and our room was supposed to be luxurious the kitchenette was actually cupboard doors not what i have expected
