the airconditioning made a the only disturbing sounds the mattresses in our room were wobbly without the supposed top pad and uncomfortable so my back ached badly also the pillows are just okay but we had much better elsewhere i spend three uncomfortable nights the bathtub is tiny the water comes out burningly hot the furnishing a bit blunt the lighing in the room is not well balanced ceiling spots right above the bed are blinding no breakfast the safe inside the room is too small to fit a laptop and the smallest i ever had so we had to leave our valuables at the front desk the price is on the higher end of comparable places we visited
