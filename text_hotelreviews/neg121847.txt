although kitchenette was well set up we had to ask for dishwashing liquid and a towel and then discovered that there was no sink plug our main issue was with the shower it started cold for about five minutes with good pressure and then decided to provide some heat at a lower pressure we did end up having a reasonable shower and so not a reason not to stay here
