having stayed at more than different hotels in london i founds this one to be quite poor value for money the rooms are not just small they are tine i booked two different rooms during my stay while small double room was decent for its price the what was called a kind room was almost the same size with the bed occopying almost the whole room the room was so small that it does not it even have space to place your luggage i dound the explanations provided by the management by email to be misleading as the room clearly was not worth paying extra pounds per night the bathroom was also quite small and the choice of amenities very limited there was also no water served which you normally get at the hotel priced at more than per night
