my sleeping top was by accident removed from our bedroom by the cleaning staff together with the linen the manager took trouble to get it back without success instead of just apologising and suggest a way forward he implied that they were not at fault that his staff is reliable and that i may have made a mistake in that my sleeping top was not removed from my room his treatment of the matter was disappointing and i will never go back to this hotel
