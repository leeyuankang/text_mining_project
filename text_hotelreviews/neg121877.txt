my partner stayed this evening as a single occupancy guest so i am writing this from his comments the room had no windows at all no phone reception at all and was rather grim design over substance so to speak they then moved him to another room which was still basement but had one bar of signal he decided to stay in this room as it was late evening but thought to himself i won t stay here again we normally stay in the ampersand down the road which is about more per room and it s a huge difference in quality service and facilities shame it was full
