rooms were tiny we were given a room in the back ground floor of the hotel and told it was an upgrade it had one open room for the bathroom which was for customers with disabilities we had paid for a king bed and this room only had a double after complaining we were given the room we had originally booked very disappointed in our experience and we paid well over pounds for our room not good value for money at all
