though the hotel is great in all aspects and i will certainly stay there again there was a small downside the shower during the rush hour around a m when all the hotel guests seem to be taking shower at once the hot water pressure is not high enough and one may experience an unexpected contrast shower with blasts of cold water however if you take your shower earlier or in the evening there is no such problem
