when leaving i asked the reception manager for the receipt of our payment and he insisted that i could not have it and had to unload it from booking com when checking in i had been told that i could have asked for the receipt at their desk only upon insisting and telling that we had paid for our stay the hotel and not booking com could i finally get my receipt it was a rather annoying experience
