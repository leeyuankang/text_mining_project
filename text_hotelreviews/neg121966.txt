this is not a complaint just an observation i placed our used towels on the rail however housing keeping replaced them with beautiful fresh ones everyday we were there nights that was great and quite unexpected thank you however from an environmentally energy saving prospective it runs the costs up for the hotel and is not environmentally friendly in using precious water and power energy when it was probably unnecessary the heater rails dried the towels throughout the day we would have put them on the floor when we needed clean ones which seems to be the universal practice
