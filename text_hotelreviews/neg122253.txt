a few minor but important details no coffee unless you paid for their continental breakfast that was majorly weird and disappointing for a four star hotel also what seems to be a steamy hot tub room is really a very pleasantly temperature pool no way to put it in hot water and no way to turn up the temperature we had a great time down there but it was disappointing at first i thought it was really a spa where we could steam and so forth thinking of it more of a private pool made it a lot more fun
