the toilet seat in the room was quite loose when we arrived and despite making reception aware straightaway it wasn t fixed for the duration of our stay only nights mind you the hotel also felt very compact and whilst this isn t necessarily a problem wasn t what i expected also the cooked food for breakfast ran low on both days from the buffet and wasn t replenished so i was left with the dregs i would have liked to have seen more awareness from the staff when it was low without having to ask
