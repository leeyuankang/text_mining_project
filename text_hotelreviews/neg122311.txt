the hotel overall is extremely small so you have to be prepared for this the room itself which was superior with a balcony interior i think it s biggest that they have is very very small to the extent that i can reach to any where in the room without moving from the bed because there was no room for me and my wife to stand or pass from one place to another without one of us jumps on the bed to let the other pass
