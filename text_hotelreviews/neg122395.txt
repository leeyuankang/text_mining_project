i could not spleep at all because of wrong fire alarm three times in a night well that could happen but the way how the staff in charge handled with it and treated the guests was simply unbelievable i thought i have enough experiences with incovinient situations at hotels but this hotel gave me a chance to enjoy a negative travel experience beyond my imagination
