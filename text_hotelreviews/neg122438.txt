i made a genuine mistake when booking this hotel and accidentally booked it for a day earlier than required arrived in paris phoned the hotel who were extremely unhelpful and despite having available rooms for the night i needed and having taken the not so cheap room rate for the no show the night before they would not allow me to stay without repaying apparently there is no such thing as customer goodwill anymore it might be a nice enough hotel but it s not cheap and in my experience the staff were rude and unhelpful shame because i was really looking forward to staying there
