the service in the hotel is very bad the staff are not helpful at all and make you feel uncomfortable in the rooms there are no power points for computers or phone chargers and in the bathroom there are no power points for hairdryers or shavers the room service food is below par for a so called star hotel when i asked for a late check out until they wanted to charge a full one night rate
