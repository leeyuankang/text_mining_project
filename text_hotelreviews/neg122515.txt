concierges not particularly helpful especially the guy who we asked to call allard and tell them we were running late and when we got to the restaurant we were told he had cancelled it i figure this was a miscommunication or your bar waiter who got my drink order wrong and blamed it on me my friends laughed as i had explained it quite well and didn t apologize literally told me that s why i asked you and blamed it on me frankly relative to the other top hotels in paris the bar is rather unimpressive
