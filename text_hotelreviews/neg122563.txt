it was noticeable that the staff were stretched perhaps due to the time of year the restaurant was understaffed and it had a negative impact on the service it was about a minute wait and then anything additional took to minutes for example extra hot water additional toast it was disastrous coffee was not very nice we also had to be moved to another room the first room was next door to some kind of housekeeping cupboard and the doors were constantly open and shut the noise was horrific so that night we didn t get much sleep we were not very happy about that and believe me we needed our rest we were exhausted the morning after i would also add that the carpets in the room could benefit a bit from a better vacuum cleaner or maybe it is operator error
