breakfast is a bit expensive specially if you are a family of in our case at per person for what is actually available there is no buffet so you have to pay for anything extra you order out of your fixed menu choices also the choices available for breakfast whether continental or cooked is quite ordinary for a star hotel i think the breakfast is a big let down for me personally during our otherwise fantastic stay at rosewood we really should have had a decent choice to choose from be it continental or cooked breakfast it appeared we would get charged for every extra we wanted of our choice the menu can be a bit confusing as well after our first day s experience we decided to skip breakfast altogether at hotel as we found better options near by this was the only issue i had in an otherwise great stay
