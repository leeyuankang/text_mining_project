the corridors to the room was a little like a labyrinth and i got lost all the time and i mean all the time as my room was on the opposite side of the quadrangle from one of the lifts but losing my way meant i found the budgies and also finding edgar a few times who was always happy to point me to the right lift stairs not a bad comment and really to be expected for an old restored building possibly one of its finer charms
