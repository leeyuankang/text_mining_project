room service is terrible both service and quality of food provided to the guest are horrendous the price is also exaggerated thank goodness theirs a mcdonald s just across the street the hotel gave rooms with the worst view possible even when requested otherwise i had a view off a parking complex very inspiring i might add the tea time at mirrors is highly disappointing they serve the worst pastries and cakes i have ever tasted in my life
