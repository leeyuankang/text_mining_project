breakfast in the holborn restaurant was mediocre but very expensive service was the worst i have experienced in any grade of hotel anywhere think fawlty towers and you get some idea staff were a total shambles mins before anyone took our order toast with no jam or marmalade and no knife or plate either toast was no more than warm bread sent it back but the replacement was just as bad we complained as did several other people and as a result we were not charged however this was a new year treat and we would have preferred to pay and have a civilised relaxed breakfast at this price i will look elsewhere next time i am in london
