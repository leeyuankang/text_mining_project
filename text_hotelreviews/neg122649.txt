having arrived in london on an early morning flight from asia i asked for an early check in i felt staff didn t go particularly out of their way to accommodate my request like other star hotels that i have stayed at in london i had to wait almost hours to get my room assigned if the hotel is going to cater for business travelers they will need to be more flexible in these types of situations
