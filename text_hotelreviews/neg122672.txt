we enjoy saying hi and greeting the little parrots living in the big bird cage outside the elevator on the ground floor however i do agree that they belong to the nature we were also surprised by the intrusion of the housekeeping for consecutive days i was having a shower in the bathroom while my wife was still in bed i heard the lady was questioning herself if there were someonelse inside the room while she had already standing outside the bathroom door while i was not decent enough to replied her that i was still in the shower
