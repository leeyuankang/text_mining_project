unfortunately the room we stayed at was awful broken down used and dirty i booked a superior family room for and a small dog the rooms had a double bed and a couch that could be opened as a bed the room was very small the hallways were also ugly and had the feeling everything was cheaply done and dirty my wife used the toilet near the reception and later told me she had never seen such a dirty toilet in her life
