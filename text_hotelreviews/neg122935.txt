oh boy hotel is worn down full of families with kids breakfast area is so crowded that you may come to que for minutes to get a seat location is far from tourist areas and the real parisian atmosphere won t stay again here before leaving the hotel my wife wanted to have a tea in the lobby the guy was so rude saying to her that he is not making any tea for person he is busy and that she should go to any coffee shop in the neighbourhood for a croissant and a coffee we went straight to the shift manager who after listening to us promise to compensate us by refunding us the parking fee which didn t happen not even now weeks later you can judge by yourself btw entering the underground parking is really an achievement parking spaces are so narrow that only mini cars fit in just to be aware of but so is almost every parking in paris
