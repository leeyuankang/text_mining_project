at breakfast one usually had to go through quite a few plates to find one which did not have food remains on it our room was cleaned for days in a row and glasses with juice in it were left in the same position we left them each time one day we came back to find our toiletries had been left in the sink after the room was cleaned in general the facilities need to be improved if this is indeed a star hotel otherwise this isn t worth the money
