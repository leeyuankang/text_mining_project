breakfast one of the most horrible breakfast experiences ever customers expected to make their own fried eggs omlettes using pans etc make their own orange juice using oranges and extraction machine no service on the table at all unlike other star hotels room size and layout horrible layout of standard room with very small size that leaves no room once the sofa bed is opened toilet on one side of room entrance and showers on another very odd combination my first such experience in years of travel housekeeping no individually packed shampoos a squeeze bottle provided instead with no idea of the content and integrity of the contents no body lotions no dental kits provided on request out of stock as per front desk first such incidence in my years of travel
