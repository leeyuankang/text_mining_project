the cooling was just a normal air it was pretty bad the first room i got was on the corner of floor the cooling there was horrible i then complained to which they changed my room as if they know that this room had problem with cooling the new room was on same floor it was better with cooling but still wasn t enough they have provided thick blankets with which sleeping was a nightmare i even have to open the window in order to sleep well the mattress in sofa was with springs and springs literally pinches you while sleeping the room service wasn t efficient on the first morning while leaving the room i put their provided tag mentioning that you can clean the room and when i was back on night nothing was cleaned next day i did the same and went directly to reception in order to tell them the lady there said that have you put something on the door to which i said yes and then she said that s why they didn t service your room but i said the tag was mentioning that you can clean the room mentioning directly that i am not in the room so you can clean it god knows what are there policies but the impression was quite bad
