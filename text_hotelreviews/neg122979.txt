be warned that this hotel will purposely try to hide charges from you like breakfast costing euros a day per person the reception will inform you that breakfast is upstairs and tell you what hours it takes place but will not make sure to let you know that you will be paying an arm and a leg for a breakfast that isn t even worth euros per person a day when reception told me this at the end of the stay and told me i owed euros i was very disappointed reception should explicitly tell their guests that they will be charged for this rather than surprise you with it at the end it all seemed very sneaky to me and not a way a hotel should want to run their business
