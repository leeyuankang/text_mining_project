all the staffs were very helpful like mr ahmad who printed our airline check ins and booking our taxi to cdg the next morning but the big minus was on the day we checked in and were told by ms ghania at the reception that we were not going to get our confirmed two adjacent rooms for persons non smoking which were confirmed and charged for since may she should not be at the customers facing position because she was arrogant impolite and even told us that the rooms were taken by expedia who booked many rooms that day is booking com lesser important than expedia really after minutes of arguments she offered to move us the next day which we decided not take it as re packing was a waste of energy had she been polite and not so arrogant we would have accepted the two separate rooms willingly she kept to her true form when we checked out by asking twice if we had taken breakfast even when we answered no to her first question already if you are checking in and see ms ghania at the reception i would advise you to avoid her to keep your sanity
