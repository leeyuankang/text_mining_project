reached the hotel at around and i have been told that my booking was cancelled systematically although i have confirmation from booking com the receptionist told that confirmation is different than the hotel confirmation which actually didn t understand so i they offered me one room instead of two and told me they can help me in finding another hotel finally they got me another room in the same hotel
