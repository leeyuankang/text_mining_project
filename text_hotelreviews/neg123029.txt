the air condition was not working and they couldn t fix it so we had to spend one night with out it next night we asked to change our room to another one with a working air condition after complaining several times they offered us a discount for the first night also we had rooms since we had kids we asked to be put into adjacent rooms but instead they put us on seperate floors
