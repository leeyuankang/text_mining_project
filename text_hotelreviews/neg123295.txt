we booked a room for two adults and two children thru booking com the ages of the children was inadvertintly entered incorrectly while making the reservation the hotel refused to accommodate us because of that booking com refused to help as well we were forced to pay for additional room and we had no choice since we couldn t cancel our original reservation bad customer service both from the hotel and booking com the rooms were too small and barely would sleep two people our room had a strong sewer type smell coming from the bathroom but luckily it was addressed promptly once we called in for service
