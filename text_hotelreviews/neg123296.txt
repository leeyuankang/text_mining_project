the breakfast was very simple and to be honest not my taste would have expected a better breakfast for the amount of money i paid per night very little choice and we didn t even bother on the second day with breakfast room was small and staff not very welcoming the room was very dated and needs updating i do not class this hotel as a star and is very expensive we were given the room at the lower level and we could hear the underground train which was constant the bed was so uncomfy the mattress was rock solid i could have got way better value for money very disappointed and will not use this hotel again unless the price drops drastically no tea and coffee in the room just these little touches are missing as well i paid extra for the poster bed room as it was my husbands birthday and thought this would be a nice touch don t waste your money
