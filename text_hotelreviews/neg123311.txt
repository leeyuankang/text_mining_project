room size is ridiculous one could access the bed from side only and the free side of the room had space for a suitcase so one had options have the suitcase or pass through moving the suitcase away no a c just a ventilator small tv radio with iphone dock iphone however fungus in the bathroom there was a chair in the room no idea what for as there was no space to sit on it i have stayed in many hotels in london even the more central have had bigger rooms the quiet side of the hotel was facing the train station so at night one could choose between the heat or loud noises from the trains i honestly cannot understand how this hotel can have a rating no space to turn around in the room no ac no mini bar it would not have fitted anyways the pictures and other ratings are really deceiving
