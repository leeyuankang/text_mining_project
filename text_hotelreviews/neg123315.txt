booked a room with two single beds as i was traveling with my elderly mother once we saw our room it was a queen only they knew this but didn t mention it went back to reception to ask they stated that it was a preference not a guarantee despite the booking confirmation stating it was two singles no refund available no rooms for us to change to i asked if they though they could have contacted us in the days since we booked to inform us of the issue but apparently it s too difficult to do so via booking com a fact i know to be untrue despite the bed issue the room smelt was on a busy noisy street and was poorly put together terrible last night in london never again
