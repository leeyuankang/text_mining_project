the rooms are unwelcoming the bathroom was at least clean and fairly modern the reception lulls you into a false sence of security and appears the the rest of the accommodation will be as tranquil it wasn t the breakfast continental choice was mediocre at best tables very cramped and you almost feel your sitting on top of other guests
