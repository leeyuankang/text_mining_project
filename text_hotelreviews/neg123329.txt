the room i stayed in made me jealous of harry potter s cupboard under the stairs at the dursleys i know the booking stated it is a small double room but hey how small can a room get i would never call that a double even for one person it s below standards me and my boyfriend literally couldn t turn around in the room and we re not fat or anything not to mention the bathroom which is like the smallest bathroom i ve ever seen in my life i felt like i m on a boat trip staying in a cabin the hotel looks a lot better on pics than in reality the pics show only the nice rooms the one i stayed in didn t even come close one more thing breakfast very very poor we ate croissants defrosted i presume with butter and jam for days because there wasn t anything else to choose from please work on it it s not such a big investment to offer a couple of things more e g more veggies selection of hams and cheeses eggs bacon more cereal better coffee tea etc
