i was surprised it is rated a star as no alcohol licence so the bar just has soft drinks no restaurant except for breakfast no room service shampoo shower gel in the bathroom but no shower cap sanitary bag etc however the main street is less than two mins walk so everything available to buy but i d like to see the rooms about a night cheaper than they are to reflect what is on offer
