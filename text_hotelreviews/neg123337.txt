very rude staff upon arrival not greeted they just demanded payment card and id we felt like we were not welcome when we walked in and it was as if she had to go out of her way just to deal with us breakfast was poor bit can t moan too much seeing as it was free rooms tiny but measurement are given in the description poster bed made such a horrendous noise when we got on or off that it made it so we didnt dare move in fear of disturbing other guests with the fees they are charging i m sure they can afford to replace it as that nights sleep was very uncomfortable and disturbed due to it
