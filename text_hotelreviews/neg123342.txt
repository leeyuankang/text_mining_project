the room was quite small and dark and the bed rather uncomfortable the layout also wasn t very user friendly for example there was no bedside table and you couldn t turn off the lights while lying in bed the week i stayed was extremely cold and the radiator in my room wasn t working so i had to have an electric heater which the staff was kind enough to provide running the entire night which isn t ideal
