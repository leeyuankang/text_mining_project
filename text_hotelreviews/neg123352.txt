the room was far too small to have a four poster bed shower was very weak would never pay recommended price the price i paid i wish i d gone to a holiday inn premier inn as it would have been better accommodation how this is rated i don t know the breakfast was very average and you get kicked out at even if you ve not finished luckily we had much more important things theatre and great meal to do so hotel and room fortunately didn t ruin our day night
