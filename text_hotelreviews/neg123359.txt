i didn t like that we arrived late and the apartment wasn t in the main building we had to walk with a newborn on the streets also i arrived with my own car and payed for parking which was couple streets away from the main building which i found very odd to park in someone else s private parking area we agreed with the gentleman who escorted us to the parking are that we can leave next day the car at the car park while we visit the embassy next morning the receptionist was extremely rude telling us that we only payed from till next day for parking and it was already am so we are late and we have to pay additional for parking if we want to leave the car there for few more hours seriously what do you think how long is it takes to get out from the apartment and walk few streets with a newborn i had to move my car and park somewhere else for all day only for i feel ripped off with the parking and for sure i won t stay again in this hotel because of the staff and their lack of communication very disappointed
