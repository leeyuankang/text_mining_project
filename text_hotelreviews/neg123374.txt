the customer facing staff are excellent but the management of this hotel need to show less contempt for the public i resent being forced to have a copy taken of a second credit card because i didn t have photo id to prove i m a uk citizen i was told this was required by legislation which is false i have recently been the victim of credit card fraud and felt very uncomfortable about this procedure it seems the hotel doesn t trust its customers but expects us to trust it with our card details which should never be lying around as a photocopy i shall not stay there again i feel very sorry for the staff having to impose this policy they were very patient with this grumpy customer and they re very professional
