double room was small the room in floor could be for person i didn t have space to place my things or coffee it was really bad how we found the corridor outside of our room upon arrival the maid didn t manage to finish and clean the area the vacuum cleaner and the dirty linens were outside of my door and also the small store with chemical materials was open with everything outside bed was okay but little moving area was noisy at night because of the roads i didn t find water to drink but the reception said that from the sink was drinking water at the breakfast room it was very busy and many persons were waiting the others to finish and after to find a place to sit very small area for the money that i paid i could have a bigger room for sure
