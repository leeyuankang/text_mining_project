when i arrived the women at the reception didn t give me a good feeling not really handsome not really talkative then the room it says deluxe room was way too small just meter around the bed i travel with two suitcases and had no space to store them so i had to jump over it when leaving the room the chair for sitting at the table was too low and not useful for working with a pc so i had to work sitting on the bed the bathroom was even smaller with just a very small washbasin and fixed shower the bathroom had no exhaustion so all the smell and vapor goes into the room the bed creaked every time i turned around also the old building has creaking wooden floors the breakfast was very standard but with yoghurt and fruit the breakfast room was smelling when i arrived due to bad ventilation this hotel with this room and breakfast is not worth it euros per night
