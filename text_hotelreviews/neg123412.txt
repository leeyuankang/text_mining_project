we booked an executive double room which increased the price for added quality and found that our double bed was two single mattresses pushed together this was a shame especially for the added price both mattresses were very hard and uncomfortable which was disappointing the walls are quite thin so you can hear talking of people in the next room also strange permanent bathroom smell
