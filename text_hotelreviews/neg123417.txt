the room was tiny the poster bed took up most of the room there wasn t even enough room either side to open a suitcase on the floor the room itself was nice and clean and relatively well equipped but the bed was a joke it squeeked and rattled constantly with little to no movement and the mattress was rock hard also had a lot of trouble with the door to the room was very hard to open with the key and sometimes would re open itself even when locked somehow overall it wasn t a bad stay but there is a few things that should be addressed for me to give it a more positive review
