staff not friendly as we arrived the lady at reception south american didn t even say hello just asked us our name w out a smile and we could barely understand her directions to the apartment as she spoke so quickly there was no hot water the day management arranged to fix it straight away but staff acted as if it was our fault apartment on floor with no lift bedroom bed is under sloping ceiling so you can t sit up bathroom is miniscule guess it is london but rest of apartment quite spacious
