for the price i paid i expected a much bigger room this was a booking for a room above standard and i was very very disappointed with the fact there was little room to move there were no bedside tables there simply was not room for them at the side of the bed which helps explain the pokiness of this room if there is two of you forget it you will be tripping over each other
