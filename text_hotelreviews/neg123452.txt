the staff are not friendly for what we paid they originally gave us a small room in the attic location on we had to pull our luggage without any help to our room which included stairs the receptionist relocated us to another room and didn t even offer to help with the luggage even when he could see we were struggling they do not offer extras like most hotels such as shaving kits or toothbrush they rarely come to your room to give you something when you ask for it they request you go to reception for it the walls are thin and you can hear people walking around the other floors above you
