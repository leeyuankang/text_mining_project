double bedroom more like twin room pushed together one matress was hard other was soft trying to get comfortable was impossible the lights were awful for some silly reason you would turn the lights off and they would still glow energy saving bulbs wouldnt have minded if it was only a few minutes but no hours later still glowing so in the morning i had to unscrew all the bulbs to actually make the room dark pieces missing of tap handles the cups for tea and coffee were tiny had to make two for a decent drink only other problem anyone on same floor and corridor as you if they shut their door yours would rattle and bang from the wind of other peoples doors
