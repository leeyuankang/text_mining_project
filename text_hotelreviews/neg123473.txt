i received a room upgrade which i really appreciated but the room was just in front of the tube station initially i thought it would have been an issue but we eventually did sleep well the room though was too small the breakfast was disappointing and the staff removed all the food at on sunday it was up to they should guarantee to the people who get there before the service stops to finish their breakfast without any rush we have been invited to take as much food as possible before they took everything away which is not very nice
