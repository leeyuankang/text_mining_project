our bed had two single beds pushed together there was a dip in the middle were they met and it was very uncomfortable there was also an outage with the hot water our first morning there the member of staff wasn t very helpful when my husband enquired about it obviously these things happen but a spot of empathy would have been nice the rest of the staff were lovely so top marks for the rest of them
