the quilt bedding had two stains on when i went to reception the did give me another cover leaving me to change the bedding the rooms didn t have air conditioning which we knew about when booking the fan left in our room was no use and the room was like a sauna which wouldn t of been so bad if our window wasn t level with the garden seating so everyone could see in meaning we couldn t really leave the curtains and windows open to deal with the heat issue the floor in the room was incredibly creaky so it made it impossible to get up in the night to go to the bathroom without waking your partner up the hallway flooring was also very creaky also so you could hear people walking past our room to get to theirs
