with busy lives and children we only get away together very very occasionally and do spend time choosing hotels where we are going to feel aesthetically comfortable as both of us work in the arts on the booking com website the deluxe double rooms looked lovely what we got we are sure was not a deluxe double room with four poster bed it did have a four poster but it seemed we were given a room in the un refurbished part of the hotel perhaps a standard double i d even looked through the photo examples of deuxe rooms provided on booking com and contacted the hotel when i booked asking if it were possible to have a particular room not always possible but worth the ask so essentially i booked this hotel going on the photos provided on the website our room was nothing like those shown and that was very disappointing considering that i could have found this standard of room anywhere very disappointed and wouldn t return or recommend anyone unless i was guaranteed one of the rooms shown on the website to be quite honest i feel we were misled by the photos on the website
