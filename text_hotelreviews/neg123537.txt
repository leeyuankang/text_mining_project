the location this hotel is located right next to the underground station you can basicallu hear the announcements in the station the walls are also thin so in addition you can hear every noise in the hotel the staff were rude when we came down for breakfast it was a monday but it was a public holiday so according to their hotel rules breakfast ran for longer the staff were unaware of this i guess and were rude to us due to the noise i woke up everyday with a headache the bed we slept on was two singles put together and there was always an uncomfortable gap in the bed
