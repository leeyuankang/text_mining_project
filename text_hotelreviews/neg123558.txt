service was not friendly and not customer oriented this experience was really awful and it ruined our vacation mood on wednesday morning we received a phone call from reception to ask us for checkout sunddenly my husband and i realized that we only booked for three nights that was one night less than we scheduled we made a mistake and felt very anxious and got worried we explained our situation to the reception lady and asked for another night stay with better price as we booked for the previous days but without any negotiations we got direct negative answer and the price we paid was almost doubled we didn t have any other better choice and had to accept it at the same time the reception lady threatened us to pack our luggage immediately within ten minutes and change to another room otherwise we would get fined around pounds you can imagine how embarrassing it was when we were still on bed at that time we totally understood it was kind of hotel policy but the service was really not freindly and not customer oriented this experience was awful and it ruined our vacation mood by the way the room is very crowded and close to traffic road the breakfast is with limited selection and not tasteful at all the only good thing is the location which is about minutes walk to underground station
