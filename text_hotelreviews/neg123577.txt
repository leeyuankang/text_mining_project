the initial room we were given was very small and the bed wasn t big enough for two people so we had to pay extra to move to a different room which was more spacious quite noisy as right next to the underground station tea and coffee facilities not up to scratch not enough for people and instead of tea spoons you get plastic sticks boiler in the room to add to the noise from the underground breakfast very very basic
