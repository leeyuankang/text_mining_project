the standard double room was a bit on the small side and you could probably get something bigger for your money the noise from earl s court tube station is quite noticeable and the walls aren t very sound proof as a young couple in our s they weren t major issues but might be off putting for senior couples i d be inclined to stay again but hopefully pay a little less if the option was available i d remove the breakfast continental wasn t suitable for us i d prefer to have breakfast out you can get a good cooked english breakfast from as little as metres away in one the many pubs restaurants on the high street for under the hotel is an excellent location
