breakfast wasn t good for us as we are both vegans it was dry toast with tomatoes and cucumber for us hotel in general was cramped the floor level changes and we kept tripping over in corridors when rooms are being serviced big bags are left all over the corridors and tops of stairs which you have to step over bit of a hazard the lift wasn t working we were on third floor
