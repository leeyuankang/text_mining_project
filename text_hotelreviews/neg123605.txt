it was down as family room but it seemed as though an extra double bed was just popped in there to get more people in we where literally tripping over each other and constantly walking into the beds the bathroom door could only open half way due to the bed being too close the room was baking even with window open but with kids this was not safe being stories high and the fan was too noisy preventing sleep very frustrating it looked nice on walking in but needs some tlc
