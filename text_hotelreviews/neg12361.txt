some staff were not very friendly took a while to warm up to you there was some miss communication with the airier pick up i gave them all the flight info but because they could identify the airline code they didn t send a pick up they could have easily called the airport or type in the airline code i provided but little apology was given they seemed more intent on blaming me for not receiving their email anyway public transport worked out to be much cheaper and easy thank you paris metro
