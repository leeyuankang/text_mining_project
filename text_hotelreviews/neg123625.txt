we did not like the way we had to enter our room through different doors and stairs as the hotel was actually two different buildings at one breakfast was toooooo poor and really was no value for money most of the times we preferred not to eat our breakfast at the hotel also they had a different option for english breakfast with charge consider that the first day we asked from the waitress for boiled eggs and she told us that the cost for eggs would have been while afterwards we saw that the cost per egg was we have paid for an executive room and we had the boiler for hot water inside the room and it made noise during night even though we had the boiler inside our room we had problem with hot water in the douche as not all the times we had hot water we could not open any windows to take some fresh air when we needed we had to get out of the hotel we had to close the door with the key even when we were inside as it was half broken and if we did not lock with a key the door would open on its own the floor made noise in every step
