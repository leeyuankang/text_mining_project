i had requested for a quiet room not facing the road or located next to the lift lobby i was given a room facing the road and right across from the main access door to the wing the room has an old latch window when it s shut you can still feel the cold air from outside seeping into the room and all the noise from the road outside it s a reasonable stay for one night
