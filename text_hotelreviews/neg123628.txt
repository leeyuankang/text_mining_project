just two small concerns the bed was quite hard i travel a lot and this wasn t a firm mattress it was hard my wife likened it to sleeping on a board secondly bit cramped in the dining room we stayed on a weekday i can imagine at the weekend it would be even more crowded also a cooked breakfast is available for an extra cost something we would have gone for if we were made aware of it we were halfway through our continental breakfast before we found out that this option was available
