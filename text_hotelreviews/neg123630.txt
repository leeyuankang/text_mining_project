i didn t like how they told me on the day i was arriving that i owed them more money for the accommodations i had booked we booked a superior bedroom apartment for adults children months in advance i even sent them a note asking for separate twin beds for the kids it was not until i contacted them via email to let them know our flight was delayed did they inform me that i owe them an additional pounds day for the additional child at that point in time i had no choice but to pay it as it was too late to find alternative accommodations in my opinion this was very sneaky and unfortunately it left me with a very negative feeling if you check the booking site it clearly shows the apartment can accommodate adults children
