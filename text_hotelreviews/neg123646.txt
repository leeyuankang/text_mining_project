quite a lot staff seem fairly incompetent although pleasant messed up our booking and then stuck us in the basement in an extremely noisy room with no air conditioning the bed was two beds pushed together with a sheet over to conceal that this was the case extremely small bathroom and i was showed that the room had an outdoor area underground which was disgusting also don t be fooled by the parking seriously don t go here really tarnished a nice getaway
