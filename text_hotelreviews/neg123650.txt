we made our booking last minute on booking com when we arrived at the hotel they assigned us a room in the back of the building in the basement it didn t look anything like the pictures shown on the website that it was small was no problem for us we are familiar with the size of london hotel rooms however the dirt we didn t expect the window was blocked by a vacuum cleaner on the outside there was no fresh air in the room on top of the radiator which the bed was pushed against and was about cm away from the pillows there was a thick layer of dust it obviously hadn t been cleaned in ages when we came up to reception to complain the staff was very rude and would not help us at all unless we paid pounds extra for another room type and on top of that we would have to move rooms during our stay this was completely unacceptable to us since the room was dirty we decided we wanted to leave the hotel since the room was dirty and we felt uncomfortable by the treatment from the staff the hotel then informed us that they would only refund of our day stay we only were inside the room for minutes we didn t use or touch anything they could easily resell the room to another victim if they wanted to this room is more like a storage space then a hotel room they should be forbidden to sell it at such a price at all any normal service providing hotel would let their guests leave if they are this unhappy with the room and refund them the entire amount we travel a lot for work and never had such an awful experience in any hotel around the world besides the room being dirty the staff is very rude and unprofessional they ve never heard of customer service instead of trying to resolve the situation at one point the lady at reception told us you are so stupid and stop talking and walked away to the other room
