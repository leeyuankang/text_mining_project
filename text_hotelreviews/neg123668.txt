the room next door was extremely loud they might as well have been sat in my room they were loud till so no sleep and there s no sound proofing in the rooms i booked rooms a standard one for my son and an executive room the rooms were both very small could do with some rules on keeping the noise down after a certain time at night and also maybe a bar area downstairs that s open in the evening to encourage people to have a little drink down in the bar rather than in their rooms
