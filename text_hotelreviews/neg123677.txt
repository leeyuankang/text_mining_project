stayed in next to the breakfast hall so from onwards constant noise could hear everyone going for breakfast doors slamming noise from neighbours didn t have any sleep at all also heating came on and off all night so again restless sleep and then woke up with a sore throat reception did not ask me how my stay was the following morning so felt i could not provide feedback
