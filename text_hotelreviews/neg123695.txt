the hairdryer was wired into the socket and had a short lead next to the bed near the floor so it couldn t be moved and was no where near the mirror which was on the wardrobe door on the other side of the room making it virtually impossible to use the hairdryer effectively i had to kneel on the floor by the side of the bed in the corner of the room to use the hairdryer and prop a small mirror that i d brought with me up against the lamp on the bedside table so i could see what i was doing the free wifi didn t work with my phone there was a cracked floor tile in the kitchen area which was dangerously sharp the water from the shower wasn t very powerful which made it difficult to wash properly
