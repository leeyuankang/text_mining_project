staff unhelpful bordering rude apartments minutes away from main hotel their largest rooms are suffocatingly small claustrophobic dark and damp feel to rooms we had an early morning appointment at a hospital near by the idea was to stay local so we didn t have to drive very early we had booked the apartment and large family rooms the apartment is minutes away something they state in the description i mean who reads the blurb in the main description this would have been acceptable but then the second shock was the size of the rooms you cannot have two people yet people living in such tight spaces they refused to refund we were left with a choice of staying here or head back home and travel in the early hours back it was that bad we decided on the latter you are all warned stay away from this place stick to more mainstream hotels and apartments
