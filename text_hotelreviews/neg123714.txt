we have stayed at the mayflower many many times twice bringing friends so have spent thousands of pounds there over the past years we asked to store a small bag for a week and was told there is a pound per day charge we find this outrageous and have never had this experience in our travels the woman manager was rude and told us to store it at a train station we will think twice before booking here again
