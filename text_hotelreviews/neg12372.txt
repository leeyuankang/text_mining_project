each night there were loud drunk people out on the square in front of the hotel it was not possible to sleep with windows open the sunday night concierge gave us wrong directions pointing us in the wrong direction to rue st jaque he was also unable to locate the first aid kit that the weekday staff had provided for us after getting a small cut on our last day the cleaning crew only gave us one bath towel lots of little mistakes that added up to a mediocre review the room was very small we had to dance around each other if we were both standing at the same time we preferred staying in the as it was quieter and had more upscale restaurants and stores this was just our preference though
