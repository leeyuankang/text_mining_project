wifi signal this is a permanent weakness in the hotel and it seems to me that room was not the only which had connection problems as there were always guests in the reception sitting in the sofas taking advantage of the good wifi there was there apart from this issue i strongly recommend select hotel for those who do not mind to have a wifi operational signal successfully active only in the hotel reception but i do repeat this is the only dislike i can tell from select hotel and i shall be there again when i get back to paris
