all of the staff were very helpful and friendly except of one staff that he never satisfied our requests and inquiries he was not friendly and with short temper the breakfast is good and clean but does not have much variety there is no business center but they offer a tablet at the reception for customers when needed you have to walk or min to get to the nearest subway station
