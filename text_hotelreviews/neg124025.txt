the rooms are extra small funny smell in some of the rooms and so very disappointing considering is a star hotel i woudnt pay that money for that quality the pictures on the web are very smartly done is just not fair on the customers to be sold something and receive something else me and my friends booked the same hotel but after one night they switched to another they were just as disapoonted
