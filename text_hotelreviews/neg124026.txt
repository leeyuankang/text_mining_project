i have left behind a skirt part of a two piece ensemble in my room which i noticed immediately and called from the train to ask to locate it and keep it at the front desk so that when i returned to london in a couple of days i could pick it up i also followed up this request with a e mail asking to get back to me as soon as they can they did not do anything when i arrived two days later they told me they did not find anything but when i talked to the manager he assured me that he will call the cleaner and will get back to me shorty he never did the manager lied to me about his assistance knowing that i will leave next day and the whole problem will disappear with me you have a better chance to find anything you accidentally leave behind in a public place than in this hotel even if you try hard to get it back
