i was really annoyed when we checked iin when i made the booking and also in an e mail to the hotel last weekend i had requested that the two rooms mine and my friend s be situated close together next door or adjacent also i had requested that both rooms be in a quiet area away from a lift what transpired was that were allocated rooms and on different floors furthermore was situated beside a lift the requests had been completely ignored i had booked over months ago which meant that there was plenty time to allocate appropriate rooms was the failure due to inefficiency on the part of the booking agent or the fault of the hotel on check in the hotel was fully booked so there was no chance of rectifying the problem
