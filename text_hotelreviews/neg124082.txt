the rooms were not sound proof at all and we could could hear the people in the neighbouring rooms all night every night the sounds of snoring t shower kettle we could hear every word being spoken and then felt very self conscious about any noises we were making even though no one was doing anything particularly noisy at all it made it very uncomfortable and we did not have a good sleep also the door in our bathroom which was a sliding door did not fully close and thus it was not great to not have privacy in the bathroom and to be able to have no choice but to hear each other using the toilet the breakfast which was complimentary in our last stay was not in this one and we found it to be ridiculously over priced even with a discount voucher which saw the beak fast at two pounds less sadly we will not be staying here again even though we love the location nor would feel comfortable recommending this hotel to anyone we ultimately did not have a restful or relaxing stay there are many other cheaper hotels inclusive of breakfast in the area i would strongly encourage these issues to be improved upon thanks
