i didn t like the fact the toilet had no sink so you couldn t immediately wash your hands also the bathroom had no door and was right opposite our bed if one was showering and the other sleeping and the bathroom lights straight in his face and the noise of the shower i know there are better rooms we stayed in better and will make a point to ask for one next time
