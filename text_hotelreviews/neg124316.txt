very disappointing experience i booked this hotel for our special occasion engagement anniversary and wrote this in my comment i asked for a nice room i was looking forward to see the surprise made by the hotel for us however i never heard any word from their side in this regard and not even given a nice room there was no view and also the room was too small a simple welcoming letter and nice wish would have made my stay nicer but nothing at all
