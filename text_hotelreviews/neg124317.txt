the bathroom is weird and very inconvenient either they forgot to finish the bathroom in room or the designers decided to trade off guest comfort for a minimalist look in all their bathrooms the bathroom is a smaller than a standard one but i must say a very neat looking one what was strange was that it had absolutely no hooks behind the door or anywhere neither were there any shelves ledges or towel rods anywhere except for one very short towel rod just behind the wc where extra large fluffy towels were folded several times and squeezed on to this rod this created its own problem but one could live with that so when one was changing or showering there was absolutely no provision for hanging one s clothes or for placing a used towel somewhere for re use one has to either keep it over the toilet seat over the sink or on the floor no exaggerations here beats me what the management was thinking it was a very big struggle and inconvenience for me as for the shower area the challenge was even worse in the shower cubicle there was not a single shelf or a wall niche to place the soap or shampoo bottle you just have to let all your toiletries share floor space with your feet that s the only way you can have your toiletries with you in the shower i reported it at reception certain it was a lapse during renovation or something like that but i and was very surprised when the very helpful receptionist came back to me after making internal inquiries to tell me that that is how all the bathrooms in hotel xanadu were i still think it was an oversight as everything else about the hotel was very good and i really would have liked to make it my preferred hotel in london if not for this inconvemience
