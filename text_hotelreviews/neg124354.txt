advertised on booking com that it was less than miles to wembley stadium which was our sole purpose for the stay in fact it was miles away half an hour in a taxi at per journey to which it cost us just under in taxis to and from wembley as we were told by the hotel staff that it would be easier to go to wembley first then get a bus to the hotel we wernt told the bus takes an hour after wembley there was no chance of a taxi with people coming out so we had to walk as far as the motorway then wait an hour until a taxi was willing to stop for us
