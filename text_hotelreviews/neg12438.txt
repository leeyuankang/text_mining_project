the maid service is iffy we stayed for days and only had our room cleaned for of those days although we left early in the morning and didn t return till mid afternoon the biggest problem is the design of the rooms especially the bathrooms it s as if the designer thought how can i make this bathroom as difficult as possible to use the sink takes up half the room leaving no room for storing toiletries but it s so badly designed that the water only trickles out because otherwise the sink would overflow the taps are round and smooth so you can t turn them off with wet hands which is kind of the point of using them you have to walk under the shower to set the temperature so you freeze or boil while doing so the rooms even for paris are extremely small so you end up with bruises from constantly tripping over furniture too bad because it s a wonderful location and the front desk staff are great
