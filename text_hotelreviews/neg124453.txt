the bathroom was spacious with quality fittings but lacked a surface for a toiletry and make up bag so we had to put them on top of the cistern the small shelf over the basin was full of hotel toiletries it would also benefit from better lighting over the mirror and a makeup shaving mirror there was nowhere in the bedroom to do make up the rainfall shower head was lovely but a hand held attachment is preferred by some people and would be a good addition
