when i arrived with my friend she was told that she had a room upgrade and i didn t get one so i felt a bit disappointed she was given a nice room with a king size bed i had a single room and it was incredibly small there was also a lot of noise from an ac unit that one of the other guest had switched on the entire night as my room faced into the back of the building i asked the night porter for ear plugs but he hadn t any i paid for the continental breakfast and it was a bit sparse of choice with basic cereals the coffee was also like rocket fuel
