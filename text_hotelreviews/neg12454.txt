we stayed nights booked a winter garden view room with bathtub arranged to the floor which view was kind of dark and dusty at least not as shown on the photos no door for bathroom so makes room humid after shower also showerhands was weak hard to being able to take a good bath after long walk the facility varies from room breakfast was a bummer what matters is the service when i ask staff if there s any kettle or maybe the cleaner forgot the welcoming water the first day they provided the answers were always nop we don t have nop you have to buy it costs euro so are u taking or not i don t think a hotel deserves a star without warm hearts and trying to solving customers needs and provide alternatives my recommendation is that it s no necessary to be equipped for every room but be prepared for some needs that s what good hotel should do not sure if i was being picky because of this is my honeymoon at least this hotel has rooms for improvement
