we booked a deluxe garden view room with single beds what did we get a room that felt like a cave with a double bed no shower and not even a door on the bathroom when we asked for another room they said they were fully booked and gave us a bedsheet and a roll of duct tape to create some privacy for the bathroom when we checked out we were charged the same price as the deluxe room the complimentary water had already had a few gulps from it
