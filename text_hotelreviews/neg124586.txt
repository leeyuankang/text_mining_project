toilet seat was broken in our room which was surprisingly annoying also we were shown to a table for breakfast went up to get a drink then another couple were also shown to our table which was by the window i had moved things around on the table to try and indicate it was taken however we did not want a scene as it appeared the other couple of ladies did so we moved not very proffessional made it quite uncomfortable
