parking was a nightmare you have to phone a number when you got to the car park so they could lift the barrier but no answer so i rang the hotels reception to be told i had to walk up to reception as noone would answer the number that was left breakfast was a bit of a sham everything lovely once you finally got it but seemed to be chasing staff constantly to get cutlery juice jams
