got in late wanted to go to bed and order room service to be told that they had stopped cooking and had run out of everything from the snack menu so ordered take away and the staff on the desk were not even good enough to ring the room to tell me the delivery guy was here they would only give us one room key which was very annoying as my partner went to the bar to get drinks and i got in the bath he asked for a key and was refused which was most inconvenient had to pay extra for wifi the bed was very tired and noisy
