room service very poor it was a selection of left overs as described by a member of your staff as a result of this we had a processed meat type sandwich cobbled together and a packet of crisps grand total of which came to a staggering where as i appreciate room service is expensive by the very nature i would expect said sandwich meal to be all singing and all dancing to coin a phrase this not being the case i would appreciate some form of recompense i shall leave this for you to determine what is fare
