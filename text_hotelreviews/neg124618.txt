the hotel was very busy at breakfast the restaurant was packed noisy and not well laid out for finding the food poor bread selection in our double room the duvet was too heavy there was only one bedside table in my opinion our room should have been a single room as there was not enough room for a double bed i wish premier inn would open a hotel nearby they are far superior and much better value for money
