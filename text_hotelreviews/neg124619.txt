the taxi service the hotel uses was very poor we booked him to take us to a show which we arrived mins late for and not only that but we had to get our own navigation out on our phones to get him there after a hour transport from the hotel felt like the gentleman was deliberately driving wrong to get more money our of the journey wouldn t recommend this at all to anyone wishing to get a taxi into the city from here we called a black cab on the next trip and got where we needed again centre of london for less than the hotel taxi even the black taxi cabs on the way back cost cheaper to book this was the only upsetting part of this trip
