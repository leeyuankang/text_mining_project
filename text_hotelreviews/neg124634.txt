the air con did not go below which on a hot day is a nightmare someone said they would look at it but never showed up we saw them giving out fans but they apparently ran our the door which opened to the outside would not lock there was a barrier outside and a small chain inside but anyone could have climbed over and bashed the door open the car park was full so they sent us to one down the road which you could exit on foot right near the hotel but when you had to return to it with your bags you couldn t get back through those doors so you had to walk down the road and then basically all the way back on yourself to the hotel side underground it was narrow and difficult to manoeuvre in a big car and they still charge not like it says on some sites for the privilege don t stay here if you want to be close to city centre either a long bus ride to the nearest tube stop or ferry ride over to canary wharf with a walk to the tube we had a drink in the bar only to find inflated prices and a discretionary service charge we went to the bar for our drinks but would have paid the same if we d just sat down and got someone to serve us we found a dirty coffee cup next to our bed though i have to say generally the room was clean and tidy small but fit for purpose i personally wouldn t stay here again mainly because i didn t find it very convenient for getting to or getting around
