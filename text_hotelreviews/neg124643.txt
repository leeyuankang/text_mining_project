the reception staff are very cold unwelcoming really think they are superior to everyone the view was meant to be a city view if looking at the back of the hotel a car park building site is meant to be city booking com you really need to change your wording the arrangements to get to the hotel also need to be clear if i had known i could travel by tube then jump on a boat to take me to canary wharf to then catch the regular ferry over to the hotel it would have saved me walking in what i class as very dodgy areas
