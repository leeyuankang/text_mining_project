the room had a few oddities there is no mini bar there is an ice bucket ice machines on the ground floor along with two glasses there are no water bottles in the room there is a kettle for tea and coffee though when we wanted drinks we of course consulted the in room menus ah no drinks apart from tea and coffee on the menu tap water only how absurd so if you re a fan of ice do stay here and use that very thoughtful ice bucket and maybe even take it down to the bar that the staff assured us was open till but was in fact closed by and supply your own ice for what i m sure will be very average mimosas we also booked a balcony room we got a juliette balcony room with a view of the river but not a balcony just an open window with a railing in front of it the bathroom was dingy and the shower head cocked to the right the hotel is a maze of corridors when i asked for directions to my room from a porter he explained that there are floors everywhere and then proceeded in telling me a very homer esque set of directions to the room it was an odyssey to be sure the location is good for exploring the lovely greenland docks rotherhithe and canary wharf with free tickets for the ferry but that s all the rest of the hotel is a bore it s average to the extreme and missing so many key features of any good modern hotel that it really feels like stepping back in time oh wait no there s a very modern vending machine close to the lobby but alas no drinks just condoms and toothpaste presumably for the working clientele who can t make it home because of the late meeting
