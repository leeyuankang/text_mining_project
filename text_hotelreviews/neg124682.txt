the service at the hotel was terrible it was my partners birthday and had arranged the romance package along with my own champagne on ice the romance package was just rose petals on the bed and nothing else they promised for his birthday there was the smallest chocolate thing which wasn t even worth sending up the shower was never a constant temperature it kept going hot and cold we ordered room service twice for drinks as it was a hot day and we had to call up twice to check where the drinks were and to ask for ice and glasses as they only sent bottles would not stay here again
