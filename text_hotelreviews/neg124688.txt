firmer pillows would be nice didn t sleep well when i go to a b b which is far cheaper you get biscuits and a variety but not here the extra effort is not there there is no ambience reception were really good even though they initially charged the price it was refunded and as an apology they they gave us free wifi in the room and a complementary drink in the restaurant why do they charge for wifi in the room also the air conditioning didn t do much conditioning i e cooling also noisy and no obvious airflow as for the restaurant food looked and tasted ok but is basically expensive pub food service was awful put at a table and then ignored complementary drinks we argued over that one plus they charge a service charge on top desert was awful then they said we had to charge to the room and reception said we should have paid in the restaurant
