the hotel was very far away from the centre which was not really well indicated on the site it takes you hour at least to get into town the service of the hotel was ok not great there is no mini bar in the rooms so even a bottle of water is not available the rooms are a long way from the main bar the furniture in the rooms especially the chairs were worn out at the bar we asked for crisps but that was not available only drinks the quality of the breakfast is very poor it is a massa production eggs and bacon were cooked long time in advance no fresh orange juice and the croissants were no good at all
