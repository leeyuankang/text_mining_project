the fact my friend got charged twice when we checked in we both payed half each for the hotel so we payed the full price on the first day when we checked out we were told that my friends payment did not go through and that she needed to pay again we advised that she received a receipt confirming payment however we were still told she needed to pay the price the member of staff who checked us out was incredibly rude and very patronising it was out of order especially for a hilton hotel my friend paid and when we left she phoned her bank who advised that she had been charged twice by this point we had left the hotel so i phoned the hotel and spoke again to the rude member of staff who was again very rude and patronising she said on the phone that the bank were lying and that only one payment had gone through and was adamant this was the case she advised that she would send an email to confirm once we received this email it contradicted everything this staff member said and advised that it was correct my friend had been charged twice my friend had to make a formal complaint regarding this matter and it ruined my opinion and expectation of hilton hotels
