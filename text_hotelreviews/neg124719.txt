no mirror at dressing table so was not able to dry and style hair with hairdryer or straighteners easily i was resorted to sitting on the floor by the door where there was a full length mirror and a socket just close enough to manage this i consider a basic consideration which is why i marked down on the facilities also there was not window in the room but there were french doors that opened onto a little veranda that would have been fine but anybody could access that balcony which was outside our room and the neighbouring room therefore didn t feel comfortable leaving open the doors at night and became a little to hot and stuffy
