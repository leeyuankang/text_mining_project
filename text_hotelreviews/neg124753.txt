when we got there at first they couldn t find our reservation and was also told that the hotel ddnt receive any of the emails i sent through booking com making certain requests to make our trip pleasant when we were even calling the hotel before we arrived they kept saying we can t find your reservation so we should call booking com and sort it out with them although i kept giving them the reference this made me really worried wit my partner and thought of booking somewhere else last minute but we thought about the fact that my card would be charged if we ddnt pitch at the hotel getting there from the train station in canary wharf was a problem the hotel could have at least mentioned they have a ferry that runs every now and again for our convinience but obviously communicating them was hard now we had to take a taxi which cost us a lot we apparently got upgraded to a king room from a double room but to be honest those rooms are small if if were we stayed was the king i wonder how tiny the doublr is for that price the hotel doesn t even have a mini bar just great the pictures of the terrace are what sold me when i made the booking but clearly they were deceptive looked nothing like what we saw there all in all mediocre standards and service i believe
