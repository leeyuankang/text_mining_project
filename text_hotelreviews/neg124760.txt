the room was very small with no window felt like a prison the wifi in my room did not work on iphone or ipad despite several attempts tried to order room service and was told there was no food left and to use just eat not the kind of service you expect from a star hotel paid over for a night stay on a weekday and this was not enough for breakfast to be included
