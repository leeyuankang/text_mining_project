the bed was very squeeky any time you moved it was very loud and noisey and un comfy there was also no mini bar which i thought was strange as the room was very hot would have been nice to have a cold drink and our room looked on to a fire exit which wasnt amazing for viewing would have been nice to look on to the thames
