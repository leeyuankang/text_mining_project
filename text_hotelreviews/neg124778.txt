from when we checked in at till we left at to go out we were waiting for the staff to bring us something when we got to the room we asked for fresh milk the robes that were included with our executive room an ice bucket and for the tv and the patio door to be fixed the only good point about this hotel is your maintenance who came quickly and sorted everything no problem fresh milk for tea was an alien concept only robe ever materialised about as did our ice bucket every time we called we were told not our department you need to call this just isn t good enough from a hilton brand one employee should have taken responsibility and noted down what we needed and then ensured other departments were informed my partner physically went down to reception twice asking for an ice bucket he would have just bought it back up but they insisted on bringing it two hours too late they never admitted they had ran out of robes one was finally bought for me with the promise another was on its way still waiting we hadn t bought relaxing clothes with us as we re planning on just chilling in our robes we never had time to relax as were constantly waiting for the door to go it all could have been solved within the first mins shabby poor organisation i d have been better off saving my money and staying in a travel lodge
