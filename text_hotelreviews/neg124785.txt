this hotel cost me a lot of money and it was for a special occasion the pictures advertised and the price gave me the impression that my partner and i would be in for a real treat unfortunately this was not the case when we got to our room we were extremely disappointed as it did not quite look like the advertised pictures also this hotel sells itself on its spectacular views which we were very much looking forward to when we opened our balcony we were in disbelief we had a shared balcony with two doors either side that seemed accessible by anyone the view was of the back of the building and nothing more i personally felt unsafe and thought that the balcony would be better bricked up as there was no view and to reassure safety i felt as though anyone could have walked on our balcony and got in to our room what was also extremely disappointing was the noise level on both mornings i was awake for it seemed from our room you could hear every little squeak and movement from what i presume the other rooms i could hear showers and toilets flushing there was lots of loud banging that was probably people just getting around there room normally but from our room sounded like someone trying to get in to our room we had a terrible balcony and view the room did not match the pictures i felt unsafe and the noise was unbearable which resulted in a very tired frustrated couple that were trying to enjoy a romantic trip i am disappointed as we were very much looking forward to this trip it was meant to be special and for an occasion we are frequent hilton stayers and expected much much better for the money and from the advertisement
