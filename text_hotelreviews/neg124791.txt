the images on booking com of the queen size room didn t reflect the actual size of room i got and it didn t look like the photos on the website the pictures made it look much more impressive than it was the room was clean and modern but the room i got was more like a box room and not queen size i wouldn t like to see the size of the standard room did upgrade to a king and that was much better
