i didn t enjoy the room itself as it wasn t the same room as depicted in the photos on booking com the room had a lack of plugs meaning we had to switch between charging devices the television had a slow response time and poor choice the room itself didn t contain a fridge which would have been useful as maintaining food was difficult the balcony wasn t great either it was just a door that opened to a walkway so the view was awful
