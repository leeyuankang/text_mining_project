it is expected to add a provisional per day on account of potential expenses so nights would have added towards it i did not accept it as it is not mandatory and i knew i would not spend anything extra but it is presumed not to be queried i have been to other hotels with the same category and this provisional day was not ever mentioned i could not have a hot shower as the water was barely tepid on the a la carte menu there is no mention that the price for each course does not include the vat plus a service charge so a meal that would have been adding up the prices shown on the menu becomes also the printed bill expects the customer to also add a tip on top of it the booklet in the room should mention that if there is an early start when checking out the staff can prepare some breakfast to take away this same booklet does not say on saturdays breakfast will not start till instead of the usual consequently i left without my breakfast which i had paid for the wifi was free but very poor i did put a good for staff because the restaurant staff made up for it some staff i dealt with at reception were not as efficient unfortunately the negatives outweigh the positives therefore i shall not return to this hotel
