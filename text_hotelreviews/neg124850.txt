the mattress was hard and the room was cold despite increasing the thermostat to its top temperature the shower head wasn t connected right to the hose so at least a third of the water ran down the tiled wall instead the water wasn t hot enough either possibly an annoying safety feature the guests in the room opposite were noisy and inconsiderate but you can t blame the hotel for that
