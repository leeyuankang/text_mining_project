there is a free boat put on by the hotel we found this excellent as it was more convenient and you can get off at canary warf tube and walk mins and jump on the boat the other option is getting off the tube at canada water and walking about mins this also isn t too bad but we went to see a show at the which finished late and by the time we got to the boat it had finished it would have been better to hae that boat running longer even for a small charge
