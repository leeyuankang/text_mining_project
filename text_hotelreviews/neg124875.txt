the room was small and it felt like we were on a boat we made reservations at the hotel restaurant waited at the bar for an hour and after the hostess seated us in the worst spot next to the kitchen when at least other tables were open no one even came to give us a drink menu or bring water after minutes of no service we left it was a very disappointing experience i ve never left a bad review but i would definitely never come back here
