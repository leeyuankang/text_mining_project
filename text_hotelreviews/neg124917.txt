i specified in my booking that my partner will be arriving after hours of continuous travel so that they could do the fastest check in possible he arrived before me at pm which is normal check in time and didn t settle till pm because a the first room he got didn t look anything like the pictures we saw for the queen deluxe with river view there are pictures of spacious rooms bathroom and we got the room in the picture which was horrible it was very small almost feels like someone could choke in there this room should definitely not be in this category b my partner asked for a different room but couldn t communicate well as his english is medium level he speaks french and arabic but no one spoke these languages although it says on the booking com page we speak your language c we ended up getting a new room that looked exactly like the spacious ones we saw in the picture yey but the air conditioning was on on cold and it wouldn t turn off it was already freezing outside we asked for someone to fix it but we got a small electric heater instead d once again we had to let go of the room we wanted and stayed in a kings deluxe room instead where all appliances were working fine but the room was as small as the first one my partner barely fit in the bathroom we lost the atmospheric room we were paying money for to enjoy if we wanted a room that size we could ve stayed somewhere else for cheaper there weren t any room slippers robes as well although we found some in the previous room we found out that we couldn t order food and drinks to the room we didn t know as it wasn t mentioned on the booking profile this ruined the experience as well we expected to find a small refrigerator in the room instead but it wasn t there on the day of our check out sunday we woke up and didn t find hot water
