the service i recieved from the staff i ordered room service then to be called back minutes later saying i would have to go to reception to then get home the day after my stay and they have charged me for something i had not had it then took me times to call to be hung up and lied to by linda at the front desk who said they could make the refund and it would be in my acocunt immediately then to be hung on by someone else then eventually getting through to the manager and saying she couldnt do anything right then so i had to wait hour for a phone call for her to say they was refunding me and it would be in my bank account the next day that was on saturday and i am still waiting for the payment back this has ruined my stay and i would never recommend this hotel to anyone
