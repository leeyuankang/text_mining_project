booked a king deluxe room with a city or river view room had neither had to ask to change second room had a better view but still not in line with the pictures seen when booking tv didn t face the bed it was on an arm but you still couldn t turn it round to face the bed not a big deal as we weren t planning on watching it much but still not what you expect when you pay for a king deluxe room water was only just warm in the morning so not a great shower website shows photos of a terrace bar but it turns out this is only available for group bookings
