we came here to stay to celebrate our first wedding anniversary and was so disappointed the check in staff were lovely very welcoming but after that point it wasnt up to expectations the room was so small the bathroom wasn t the cleanest either looked slightly run down the tv lost signal every also had a constant high pitched noise going all night that kept us awake and the room walls were so thin every noice of talking walking past was heard very loudly heard another rooms tv going off till am other than disappointment of the room we went to check out restaurant bar and can not put in a good word at all the staff were so rude to the point we decided to eat elsewhere the attitude of the food and beverage staff that were serving on time of our stay really let it down we also skipped breakfast the next morning too to avoid the restaurant such a shame as was looking forward to staying in hotel for meal and having few drinks with the beautiful view overall very disappointed
