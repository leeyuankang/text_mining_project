when we arrived we were assigned a room once we got to the room we found that it was still being made up by the facilities staff we mentioned this to reception who then replaced us into another room but with a less adequate view this shouldn t have been an issue in the first place and rooms should not be issued to guests until fully cleaned and tidied the floors were incredibly creepy and we were worried about waking other guests
