the room price we paid was the same as the executive room however our room was not up to scratch the tv didnt come out from a fixed position on the wall deeming it useless this was the only downpoint other than that and the bad pricing it was okay balcony room hardly worth the extra money especially without breakfast i would also recommend not checking out dead as gets very very busy or make sure you can express checkout
