the fire alarm went off several times during the night finally becoming an urgent continuous bell at as a permanent wheelchair user i had been given instructions to stay in my room if the alarm sounded and a member of staff would come and get me this did not happen we could not get a reply from any phone number so my wife had to get me up and dressed not easy i need to use a hoist to get in out of bed we went to reception where chaos reigned full of guests in various states of dress a member of staff in a hi viz jacket was explaining the situation to one couple saying he would speak to everyone individually i interrupted him to suggest that he made an announcement so that everyone could go back to bed which he then did it was clearly ridiculous that it took me to suggest this and my wife was very distressed that hilton had not followed their own instructions and notified us that we were either safe or unsafe in our room the following morning all the guests looked very worse for wear we saw one man leave at in the morning he couldn t take it anymore obviously however edward loader head of operations spoke to me at length and said that he would waive the cost of our room for the dreadful night a gesture i appreciate
