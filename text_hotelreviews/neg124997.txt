we were attending a wedding nearby on this occasion and so my requests of the hotel were a bit more critical than usual particularly early check in so that we could change in preparation for the wedding at check in approx i was told that early check in was not available the receptionist s response to my suggestion that they should at least have communicated this to me ahead of arrival was that they had no record of any of my requests i have been using booking com for many years and this is the first time that has been claimed i am inclined to doubt the accuracy of that statement therefore thus very poor service from a four star hotel
