we had pre booked a room only to get there find it had been given to someone else then told they didn t have a similar room available which we refused to accept got given a room as we opened the door walked in on someone already staying in that room fuming at this stage we were given a twin room which was nothing like the room described or paid for not a good experience staff very unhelpful
