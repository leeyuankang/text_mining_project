i called from the airport to ask for directions to the hotel they told me they didnt really know they transferred me somewhere and nobody picked the phone considering the roaming cost it was a waste of money i had mentioned in the booking that i was taking my daughter to london as a birthday gift i expected some kind of special attention or at least saying happy birthday to her but none of it happened getting some food at the bad took ages bad location if you want to do sightseeing the closest station is quite far
