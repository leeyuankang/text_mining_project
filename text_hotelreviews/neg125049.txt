staff were abrupt at the restaurant when asked for food at and said food had stopped being served but the website said until the restaurant didn t suggest getting food at the bar had to pay a deposit for the room per night hopefully this will be refunded soon the car park at garage is strange there is no way down to the car park direct from the hotel you have to use the car entrance to access your car and walk across the car park
