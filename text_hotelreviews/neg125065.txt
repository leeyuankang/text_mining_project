arrived in the hotel in the morning to leave some bags i asked them if they have my details as i booked my room a couple of weeks back via booking com but they said my name was not on the system even when i showed them my confirmation email they assured me that they will fix it but when we came back at night to check in they still said i wasn t on the system then i heard another person complaining because she was in the same situation as me
