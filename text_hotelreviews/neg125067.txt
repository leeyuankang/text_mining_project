paid for a deluxe king room with balcony but the room was small and there were no chairs on the balcony so we couldn t sit out there also it overlooked a car park and tennis courts should have booked a river view room the housekeeping staff knocked on our door twice way before check out time asking what time we were leaving so we felt rushed to get out the room when i booked the room it said breakfast included but when i checked in we were told it was not the tv in the room was on a wall next to the bed and it wasn t on hinges so we had to lay side ways on the bed to watch it bit strange
