the staff on the reception desk are polite but painfully slow we were initially allocated a room that bore no resemblance to the description on booking com we returned to reception to be greeted yet again with a long queue too few staff and another painful wait finally we were given another room slightly better but it didn t match the criteria that we d booked this whole situation had taken far too long we were due at another appointment for a very specific time and were late the reception desk is the front line they should be reassuring alert and quick the staff here at doubletree docklands are non of these we have stayed at other doubletree hotels and had a wonderful experience and that s why we chose this one think very carefully about booking this hotel it s nowhere near the standard of the others
