i had contacted both the hotel and used the chat option on the hilton website as i am a photographer and required uninterrupted views of canary wharf both recommended the same room so that s what i booked however the only way to get a view of canary wharf was to stand on tip toe and hang out of the window thankfully there is an outside area that i could use for taking pictures but if the weather had been bad this would not have been possible not the view i was promised by reception or the person on chat the staff seemed to lack training subsequently some were great and others were unsure of pretty much everything in some cases the bar for example the staff were good but way to stretched which did not help them or the customers
