staff were rude from start to finish we were checked into our room late after emails months in advance about early check which was great after a flight my wife fell asleep in the lobby she was so exhausted multiple people were checked in ahead of us and all they could say was its not ready no apology or niceties were given my wife and i were both ignored in the bar more than once to the point were we just left horrible experience and we won t be back i wouldn t even give star considering how expensive the room was i have stayed in hostels and had a better experience for pound a night not oh and they also tried to charge us extra for the room claiming that this was their policy even though the price on booking com was final
