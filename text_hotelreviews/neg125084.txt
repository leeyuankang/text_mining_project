terrible parking which we were charged twice for then had to carry our cases up two flights of stairs to reception long queues for checking in checking out breakfast rude hotel staff housekeeping supervisor barged in our room whithout knocking telling us we shouldn t be in the room then after nearly an hour of waiting not knowing what was going on we were told we could stay in the room paid extra for a bigger room with balcony and river city view but the room still felt cramped and the bathroom was tiny the door hit the loo when you opened it and there was barely a square foot to stand in the whole bathroom as for the balcony with view the river city could only be seen if you stood right at the edge of the balcony and stretched your neck right over and round poor quality breakfast bacon was more fat than meat and the rest was tasteless when i tried to complain whilst checking out i was shot down and ushered off as quickly as possible real let down expected a lot more from this hotel
