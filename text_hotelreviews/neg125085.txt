oh dear we arrived early during the day and from the way we were received and welcomed i thought this was going to be an amazing stay unfortunately i would be sorely disappointed the service i received from the night staff was the worst i have ever seen and received and for the last months i spent at the very least to days a month in a hotel i thought i seen it all first night having requested before my arrival foam bedding through hilton honors my wife s allergic feather down as silver status member i am apparently entitled to this but alas i didn t find any i tried to call and left the phone on speaker for a good minutes before i hung up i tried another number that they made available apparently this number was supposed to make your stay better and no answer again then i had to trek five floors down through a maze of rooms on the ground floor you have to see how poor the floor layout is to appreciate the strain and when i finally got to reception guy told me they never answer their phones on weekends because the phones are serviced he also told me it would be impossible to get any foam bedding because he could not leave the front desk because pointing at the queues of people behind me i returned my wife removed all the bedding and we were prepared to sleep on a naked bed when bless his soul he managed to give us one paltry foam pillow the next day when i went downstairs and reported the lack of foam bedding maria was amazing she apologised for the inconveniences and assured that the matter would be resolved without any hassle and she kept her promise i thought ok perhaps dude from the night before had a bad day hey i worked in customer services for many years in many ways as a government official i still do so i know you cant always have your a game on when it comes to customers i forgave him and doubletree
