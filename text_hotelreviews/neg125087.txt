queuing for minutes to check in with nobody explaining why it was taking so long and it was very unwelcoming when we came down minutes later there was still a queue the tv in the room was in an awkward position when we arrived back on saturday evening there was nowhere to sit in the bar so we went outside only to be told that the area was closed so we went to bed breakfast was disorganised though i had spoken to the kitchen about gluten free toast when it arrived it the bread hadn t been toasted and the waiter suggested we put it in the ordinary toaster when we checked out the receptionist didn t even ask if we had had a good stay definitely won t be coming back
