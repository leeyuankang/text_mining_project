i planned the nights stay here as a surprise for my boyfriend it was supposed to be a luxury getaway based on the amount i paid i booked a table ahead of schedule and the only time available which was admittedly we were a little late the member of staff then appeared so desperate to clock off that he made us feel like we were an inconvenience the food was average lack of facilities in the bedroom meant i couldn t even make a coffee in the morning overall i feel disappointed by the stay and the service we were given ultimately a waste of money on something that was meant to be special
