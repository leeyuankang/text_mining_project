the room was stuffy and smelt stale not what you expect when your paying the cost you are also the room i booked was a deluxe queen room which was not deluxe by any means the bed was a standard double bed the bathroom was tiny there was nothing about the hotel that stood apart from a cheaper priced one the price you pay is for the name of the hotel it s most certainly is not reflected in what you get i will not stay there again also the photos advertised with the hotel are very missleading
