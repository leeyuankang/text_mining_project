the rooms and bathrooms were a lot smaller compared with the marriott which is a short distance away and cheaper staff talk to each other whilst serving you which feels a little rude they rush through the check in i missed the small print where they actually debit your account of a further on top of the room cost then refund it back within days where they know there has been no damage theft i called about this and was told to call back if the money doesn t go in annoying the worst part of this experience was breakfast having arrived at a busy time i had to queue for about not too much of a problem but what really annoyed me was that we were queuing when we could see lots of empty vacated tables which just needed cleaning however there was a shortage of staff so the tables were not being cleaned until a lot later than the guests had exited probably to ensure that they had actually finished and not gone to get more food perhaps also annoying was the girl at the front restaurant desk in front of the queue who would see people walk up let them join the back of the line then bark at them saying excuse me you have to give me your room number first before you line up not what was expected for a hilton hotel
