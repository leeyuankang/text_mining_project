i had a rather frustrating experience i booked the room because it came with a guaranteed view and a bathtub in reality the room looked out onto another building through dirty windows so i complained and the staff tried to be helpful upgrading me to a room with a view of the river i was so pleased until i actually got inside the room it was a family room and had two double beds in it and wasn t cosy or nice at all for a romantic getaway with my boyfriend it just all felt so wrong the bath drain didn t work so we couldn t have a bath and the toilet didn t flush properly it was supposed to be a special night away for us an anniversary and birthday celebration and ended up being rather a let down in terms of the room and facilities etc i had also called ahead twice to stress that it was a special occasion confirm that i would have a view of the river and ask for some wine glasses to be in the room which i was assured i would get and never got when i checked in i asked again and still never got wine glasses which is just freaking annoying
