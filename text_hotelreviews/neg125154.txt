the view paid for a city river view but could only really see the ferry dock the roof of the walkway connecting to the other half of the hotel not exactly the prettiest of views the wifi didn t work properly which wasn t ideal our room was right invetween the boiler room and the lift so all we could hear throughout the night was the pressure valve in the boiler and the lift shaft clanging the price that we paid for the room just for night i feel wasn t justified with what we received of all the things we were promised when booking the two most important things the river view and the city view were amongst others the two biggest things lacking i would stay here again if the prices were lowered
