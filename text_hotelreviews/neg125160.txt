firstly when we got in our room and started to unpack we found a pair of ladies underwear not my wife s then my wife found a pubic hair in the bath the next morning at breakfast my wife went to have some cheese which was in a wrapper and noticed it was a month out of date we told a woman that looked like she was managing the breakfast about the cheese in which she did say sorry and walked off with it after that we did not see her again and we was there for at least another half a hour after to top it all off as we checked out we went down to the car park to set off home as we got to the shutters they did not open so we parked back up and went to reception to find out how we get out that s when we got told that we need a car park coin to get out why we was not given this when we checked out i don t know as i paid for the parking whilst checking out so then we finally thought we was ready to go but no we couldn t get out still because the had done the same to two other cars my wife went back upstairs to tell them what was going on she came back down with a caretaker sort of guy who said to my wife i don t know why they always do this meaning this is an ongoing problem the staff where rubbish at this hotel they defiantly need more training i would not recommend this hotel and i most certainly never stay there again
