the bar staff in the evening were awful didn t know what they were doing didn t know whether or not they were serving food and took far too long to make drinks and serve you i had also informed the hotel that it was my partners birthday and it would be nice if they could make the room just that extra bit special but no such extras were made which is a shame cause i would have been happy to pay for a bottle of champagne or something in the room on arrival there was a long queue to check in and out we were also woken up by a cleaner in the morning continuously knocking on the door and then when we answered she simply said it was the wrong room staff at breakfast were not very helpful either although the food was nice and there was a great selection there was no coffee and no one to ask for help
