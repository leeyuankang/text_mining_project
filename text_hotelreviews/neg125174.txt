when we first arrived i had booked a room witha private balcony and a partial sea view they gave us a tiny room with a tiny window with no view or balcany like i had booked the problem was that i had booked this room especially as an anniversary gift but they gave us a very subpar room thankfully they changed the room for me after a little complaining and the new room was much better and overall didn t spoil our stay
