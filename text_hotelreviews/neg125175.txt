i had purchased a deluxe king room with balcony and was also told that i would be able to check into my room early upon arriving they said that the room wasn t ready but we were able to leave our bag with them in a safe place when we eventually got into the hotel room at night time we found that our king bed was in fact two single beds pushed together there was no balcony whatsoever and the bathroom wasn t great the power of the shower was also very weak which left us disappointed the morning after overall i feel that this hotel was not value for money whatsoever and me and my partner both feel very disappointed by this hotel and its facilities
