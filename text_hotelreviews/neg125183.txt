the car park located in the hotel was completely full so we had to park our car outside down the road when we arrived they told us our room was no longer available and gave us a different room we took the key and went into the room to find they had given us a key for someone else s room with all they re belongings in there i was mortified i would hope that my possessions are safe in the room but this made me uneasy the rooms were ok basic nothing amazing for the money
