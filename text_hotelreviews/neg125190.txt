the staff was very helpful but we had a small confusion upon our arrival the receptionist gave us a room with partial side view on the river whilst we ve booked one with full view on the thames queen size when we contacted him he said that luckily there was still one room available with full view so we changed for that one happy end for us eventually but just be sure you get the room you booked
