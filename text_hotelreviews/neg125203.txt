view from the room was more onto an ugly building across but from the right angle you still have a view of the river it s a short walk from the ferry to canary wharf station but long enough so that if it were raining it would be off putting but in good weather it s a pleasant walk but there is a bus supposed to arrive in front of the hotel too that goes to canada water station to be honest this is nitpicking
