tiny claustrophobic rooms expensive wifi poor service noone picks up the phone had to chase roomservice times went through reception who promised they would call back but nothing happened in the end it took to get some food to the room which meant i could not get to bed until asked for a newspaper at breakfast was promised to have brought to my table finished breakfast minutes later without any papers seems like staff very nice and agreeable but then doesn t care much about carrying out the actual service far from public transport
