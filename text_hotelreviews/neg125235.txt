we had many issues with the hotel as soon as we arrived firstly they had given us the wrong room and then we rang the reception so many times without any answer we rang all the numbers and no one answered any of our calls which made us have to walk all the way down to the lobby overall it was a very disappointing stay with us questioning whether this was really a hilton as we have never experienced such bad service in any hilton we have stayed at before we would not recommend this hotel to anyone
