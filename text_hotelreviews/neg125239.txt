well the rooms are as basic as a travelodge or premier inn despite paying for a deluxe room the tv didn t work the bedside lights didn t work not even bottles of water were provided i wouldn t bother paying the hiked fees for this hotel spend your money on a decent hotel that is actually worth the amount there s alot more noise than i was expecting too the beds are so soft so i wouldn t recommend if you suffer from back problems overall i m very disappointed
