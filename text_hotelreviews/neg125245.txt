i thought as it was my partners birthday i had booked a room with a balcony and river view i could slightly see the river but i more had buildings and a badminton court it was my partners birthday and i had spoken to someone and they said they would put a little something in the room i got their and their wasn t anything when i rang reception the lady on the phone said to me ill pass u to the manager she can deal with you in a very very rude manor then the phone was hung up on me i didn t feel like the ladies at the front of reception was approachable to talk to them about it especially after i had been spoken to the way i had on the phone i have always stayed at your branches and found them lovely but to be honest this kind of ruined our trip a bit as i was very angry
