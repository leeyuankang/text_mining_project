breakfast looked delicious and had loads of choice but cooked breakfast was all cold and served on cold plates easily avoidable mistake which ruined it tried to charge me over to make two quick phone calls to my husband who was lost having been redirected to a different car park as hotel one full and had my phone with him by mistake that was very disappointing and ridiculously priced they took it off the bill but to try and charge that amount seemed very unfair
