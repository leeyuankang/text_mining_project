one of the reception staff was abrupt and unhelpful i do not understand why we was offered a newspaper if it wasn t going to be available we didn t find out our paper was unavailable until we asked for it we had to queue for a long time for breakfast there clearly was not enough staff available to cope with the demand i had to ask for a glass for juice on several occasions it was a similar scenario when i wanted a bowl i was finally told they were all being washed
