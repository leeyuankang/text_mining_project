the hotel could do with a small store selection of supplies nearby or on the premises a fridge in the rooms would be very beneficial my only other minor quibble would be how small the bathroom sinks are i enjoy having a really large sink when i go away as i only have a very small sink at home so was disappojnted to see that the sink was the same size as or possibly even smaller than my one at home doh
