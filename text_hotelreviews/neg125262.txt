there was no net curtain to cover the balcony door and you could see the bed in the next room the only way to get privacy was to shut the curtains which blocked all the sun out the tv was fixed flat to the wall therefore you could not lay on the bed to watch tv to relax we ordered a continental breakfast to be brought to our room firstly it arrived later than within the of your given time there was no spoons for the cereals there was no pastries or croissants and quite frankly the tray arrived looking like it had been thrown together and not nicely laid out as we would have expected i rang room service to ask for the rest of our breakfast items but got no reply so i rang reception a short time later pastries and spoons were brought to the room but no croissants we were not happy with the way the staff member pushed his way into the room we felt our privacy wasn t respected on this occasion we would not return to this hotel lastly there was no light near the only mirror in the room that would be used to dry your hair and put on make up light is needed for these tasks
