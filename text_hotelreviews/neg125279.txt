our room was right next to the lift machinery equipment and very noisy and also right above the loading area which was a problem and spoilt our break value for no we complained at reception and they offered a free breakfast but that wasn t any compensation then as we checked out we were blocked in on the hotel car park for half an hour by a guest that had gone out for the day its a free for all with parking that the hotel have no control over our stay overall was very disappointing and it ruined a special weekend we had looked forward to for a few months nice staff but we got a raw deal and won t be returning
