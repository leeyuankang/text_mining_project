breakfast staff very rude i had to ask times for a cup of tea at breakfast most hotels offer you a pot when it did come it was slammed down in front of me also whenever i ve stayed at a double tree hilton we ve been given warm cookies on arrival this wasn t offered but must have been available as i saw other guests with them
