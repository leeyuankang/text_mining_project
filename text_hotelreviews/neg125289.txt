our room felt like it was in the staff area poor view car park bins corridors a bit shabby in places lifts tiny our room was adequate but small bathroom location my only gripes nice to have a balcony if only to strain ones neck to see the view of canary wharf the bar staff were frankly poor this needs addressing especially in the evening after events more heated areas outside too for us non smoking capers cookies not all that
