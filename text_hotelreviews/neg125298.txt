the fact it took nearly minutes to check in was crazy to have an e check in desk which i had done and a hilton honours desk to recognise different guests was great but then to not let guests use the different desks was madness i tried to check in at but was told the room was not available you should have let me check in at that point instead of telling all guests to come back later creating a massive queue that you could not cope with as i say madness additionally it took keycards to get out car park and i did not enjoy walking up and down the road
