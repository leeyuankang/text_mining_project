terrible location we specifically booked this hotel because booking com said this hotel was miles from tobacco docks where we were attending the bafta gaming awards that evening we could have stayed at any hotel but chose this one based purely on location value for money what a joke miles should take no more than minutes in a taxi and it probably was minutes from our destination across the river the reality of it was a minute journey via car booking com need to make this clear on their website as we were then late we also paid extra from a room upgrade a superior twin room well all i can say is god knows what the standard twin room was like because there was nothing superior about the superior twin it was tiny the bathroom was so small i didn t even have room to dry myself off after the shower it reminded me of being on a boat the layout of the hotel is also horrendous upon check in you are given an elevator number a floor number and a room number all of the elevators are located in different locations across the hotel it was like a maze we had to ask for help in the end as lift was no where to be seen eventually after walking through the main building across a bridge and around several corners we finally found it and that was just to get the lift up to our floor oh and suprise suprise despite us having suitcases suit carriers and a carry on bag not one person offered to help take our stuff to the room
