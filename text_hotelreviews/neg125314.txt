the ferry was actually great after i booked the hotel i realised it was not in canary wharf itself but across the river so i was expecting to spend a lot of money on taxis but still slightly inconvenient if planning to go out at night one of the men on reception was a little rude and not helpful at all which is a shame as all the other staff were brilliant and very accomodating my friend and i do not know london that well and he talked to us like we were idiots
