when myself and my partner arrived we were first given our card key to a room that was extremely small very hot with a fraction of the river view i was extremely disappointed with this as not only was we lead to a very poor room but there was no champagne waiting that i organised as a surprise for my partner i was left quite embarrassed and had to go back to a reception immediately and inform them that the room was not what i expected and was not what i upgraded the lady confirmed the room was an executive queens deluxe however i knew this was not the case as i did carry out a lot of research on the variety of rooms that the hotels offers when i upgraded the room to a maximum price i could afford without arguing she immediately gave us a new card key for another room which thankfully we were very happy with unfortunately another problem occurred in the morning when we arrived at the restaurant for our breakfast we were informed that breakfast was not included in our room i had to bring up the confirmation on my phone to confirm with them to be allowed in which again left me fairly embarrassed in front of my partner bedroom although our room did have a wonderful view the bathroom was very small the bathroom tap was leaking and from what we could see this was a problem in the room for quite a while as the bathtub was fairly green under the tap the bathroom was very hot and stuffy and there was no vent
