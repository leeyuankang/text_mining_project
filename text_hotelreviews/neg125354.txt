had some problems checking my booking hence the upgrade i simply wanted to know if i could check in early and if we had two double beds as per the website the effort it took to find this out was less than good and spent minutes talking to people to find this out i even called the hotel and was told to talk to my travel agent also had problems ordering some sandwiches and room service just after an hour and half later we cancelled the order they waived the parking fee to compensate
