me and my boyfriend booked this for valentine s day and booked a king with a balcony i chosen this hotel as it was so close to the river and had wanted a room with balcony with at least a decent side view of the river in the booking i asked very nicely if it would be possible to have a room with a decent view as it was my first valentines i m originally from london and absolutely love the river when s we arrived the room we received was over looking a car park we were at least four rooms away from the view of the river from the side that was visible through literally a crack in between buildings i didn t even feel like we were next to the river at all i appreciate that there are many rooms but seeing as i had specifically asked very nicely and there were many rooms that were closer to the river even from the side or ones that over looked a a small artificial lake would have been fine but i may as well have been in any hotel in london the view was the opposite direction to all of the classic london sky line so basically could have been anywhere i couldn t help but feel very disappointed it s not like i was not willing to pay for a room with a decent view but this was the most expensive room that had a balcony this was my first ever valentine s day as i have never been in a relationship before and i can t help but feel like it was a let down as i had booked this hotel specifically for the view of my beloved thames
