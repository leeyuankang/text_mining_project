our first night was spent freezing in a room with no heating we made several complaints after receiving extra towels and a thin blanket to stay warm finally the manager came with a portable heater he was very apologetic and we did receive a discount room transfer for the second night and complimentary breakfast however the first night was very uncomfortable due to the lack of sleep and temperature i have recently been very unwell and being so cold all night was certainly not ideal
