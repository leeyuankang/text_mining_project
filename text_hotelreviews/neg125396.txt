the wifi wasn t free in the room according to my girlfriend i didn t use it and stuck to the room was really nice but in the booking it said we d receive a city dock view and we faced the opposite way it wasn t too much of a big deal the room itself creaked lots the doors and floorboards from our room and the surrounding rooms creaked and the bed was although comfy hard to settle in because it was by far the creakiest thing an alarm did go off at which was incredibly loud we didn t know what it was but it could have been because the heating was up we had no warning this would happen and it my girlfriend was a little shook by it
