we arrived quite late to check in and were quite tired from a day walking around london we got to the room and it was pretty nice until we started noticing small black hairs all over the place we ran a bath and just before getting in noticed a number of these hairs floating in the bath then went to the sink and more hairs there went to phone reception and to my surprise there was even hair on the phone reception didn t answer despite a number of calls so we ended up having to go back to reception to complain we were given a new room but this isn t really ideal at midnight when all we wanted was a relaxing bath and to get to bed the staff seemed too used to dealing with complaints and even at this time there was a queue at reception where we overheard a few more complaints
