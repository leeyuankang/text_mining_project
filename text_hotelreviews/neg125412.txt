i thought i had booked the hotel near the tower of london so was disappointed when we arrived the hotel location was quite a distance from any sightseeing places and with the ferry that takes you across the river finishing at midnight we felt like we were on a curfew our rooms felt like loft conversions with slanted ceilings not great with a husband and you could feel and even hear the springs in the mattress so no sleep for all the wrong reasons our alarm went off on the final evening of our stay with no explanation whatsoever to top it all off the towel rail was positioned behind the bathroom door so sprang back every time you opened the door causing injury on the last day to my arm
