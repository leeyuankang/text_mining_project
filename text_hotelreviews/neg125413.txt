the first room we was given out of radiators worked which meant our room was freezing very small room considering price we paid we got moved to another room which was also very cold we arranged for breakfast to be brought to the room the same as many couples at the hotel and after waiting an hour our breakfast did not arrive and didn t think the overall service was acceptable for a valentines weekend stay at a hilton hotel
