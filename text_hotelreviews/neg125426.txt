the fact that i had wasted my phone bill and rang customer services straight after i had booked the hotel room asking for a small favour to make that one night very special for my girlfriend as it was her asking if they could give us a room with a good view or anything nice and on the phone they did say they will book us into a good room with a nice view but when we got there they had given us a room with a backyard view and very denced space i wasn t happy at all i had to make the effort to ask if they could change the room which they did but not what i expected for me this was very embarrassing overall the fact that i had rang customer service and had it planned weeks before the arrival and still walking in to something completely opposite to what i expected not happy
