the whole hotel is clearly tatty and slightly tacky the hallways the doors the woodwork in the rooms are that old dark brown stained bashed up wood used in seedy cheap b bs around the uk they have pipped an artificial sickly sweet air freshener via the air conditioning which makes a dreadful noise when on into the corridors and bedrooms truly nauseating if not a health hazard the shower bath very narrow and difficult to climb into for a shower and slippery had rusting taps and mould between the all the edging the towels and flannels were actually shredded the beds were so creaky you daren t move for waking people up and you could hear everything that was going on in the neighbouring rooms oh and finally if you are into all things brown this is the hotel for you not at all what we expected for a so called star hotel shame on you
