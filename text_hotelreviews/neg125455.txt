staff came across a little rude trying to rush us through check in maybe as there was a que but still we had travelled for over hours and it didn t feel very welcoming we only had milk sachets in the room so when we returned from an evening at the we went to reception to ask for more milk so myself and my partner could have a drink from the room facilities but it seemed we interrupted a conversation between members of staff i felt uncomfortable on departure when checking out the receptionist did not tell us about stairway in the building down to the carpark so we went outside and found we couldn t exit the way in which we had arrived as the metal shutter gate to the car park was down this wasnt down on arrival down the ramp so we came back up the ramp into reception to be told of a stairwell in the main reception going down to the carpark then after going downstairs we found out that you need a coin to exit the carpark which we were not given after returning upstairs a second time and feeling rather annoyed after having to que and ask to get the coin it all felt very unorganised
