i ordered room service pizza chips and some noodles i had to wait for over an hour for this when i finished you was told to leave the plates on a tray outside your door which we did it was very dangerous and the corridor was very slim but that wasn t my main concern when walking to breakfast the next morning me and my partner walked in a private room next to the elevator mistaking it for the stairwell and in there was the tray with the plates and leftover food on i have photo evidence the room was clean but bits were obviously rushed and missed there was what seemed to be a pubic hair on the telephone and long blonde hair in the bath i have brown hair overall it was an average hotel to stay in nothing like it makes out to be i recently stated in the hotel in leeds doubletree which was amazing and is the only reason i went for a hilton doubletree again very disappointing
