i m not sure that it was the faults hotel but when booking this for new years eve through booking com i was led to believe i had booked the hilton beside tower bridge we therefore had planned out entire day thinking we was in another part of london when in fact we was the other side of the river this caused a few issues as we had tickets booked for the theatre a restaurant booked for the evening and even tickets purchased for the fireworks all on the south side yet we was no where near any of this the hotel is lovely yet very disappointed with booking com as their description of the hotel is not up to date there is no swimming pool and the king suite does not have a kitchenette nor does it look anything like the pictures they are advertising
