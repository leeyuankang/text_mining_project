hotel was quite out of the way as the tube station was quite a walk as we found out with bags in tow there is a bus service which runs from canada water station to outside the hotel which was useful but next time i would rather stay more central as we spent a lot of time travelling in and out plus a tray charge for breakfast was rather extortionate however it was nice
