i booked a smoking room as an essential part of my stay with the intention of smoking my last box of cigarettes ever with plans of giving up for so my partner and i arranged to do it in style only to arrive at the hotel and be told they have never had smoking rooms we decided to stay anyway since we had made the trip trying to park was also an issue as the shutters did not work so i had to leave the car and walk back in to inform staff who let us in manually i believe we checked in at and checked out at because what i had prepared myself for in terms of smoking my last box of cigarettes ever became much more stressful than i had anticipated so much so that i had to check out and we deemed it better to go home rather than stay in the hotel room
