hotel is very isolated unless the ferry to canary wharf works for you i chose the hotel because booking com told me it was only a couple of miles from the venue in wapping i was spending the evening at it didn t point out there was a bloody great river in the way and the taxi fare to get across was about so the need to use bus and overground meant i had to leave before the end
