our tv didn t work i m sure if we d asked it would have been sorted but as we were only staying a night we didn t bother shame it wasn t checked beforehand though the main issue is with the wifi the code didn t work in the room and we had no phone signal i really think such a massive hotel chain should provide free wifi in the rooms
