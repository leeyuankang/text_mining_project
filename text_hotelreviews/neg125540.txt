i emailed to find out about the ferry to get to the hotel but received no reply i called to check and the person i spoke to told me it was complicated to get from the tube to the ferry so recommended getting the bus it s actually very easy to get to the ferry from canary wharf the room was okay but as i have found with lots of these rooms on booking com in london they are huge rooms that the hotel really has trouble selling or need upgrading and don t really represent a deal as such
