the length of time it took for us to actually check in was ridiculous i had always been told double tree are great hotel and give you a cookie on arrival where as this wasn t something we experienced on our stay but did see others had which isn t great service also we had booked the king suit and this looked nothing like the pictures there was no telephone in the room to call down reception and we was on the floor staircase so as you can imagine this would have been useful also the hotel added on to our taxi fare and we wasn t made aware there was an additional charge for the hotel calling the taxi overall i was disappointed i wouldn t choose a hilton or doubletree again i would recommend a novotel
