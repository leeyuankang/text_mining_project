the ferry over the river is difficult to find when you first arrive on canary wharf side when you eventually find the dock there are no clear directions not particularly good when you arrive late in the evening very tired also tv in room was not working so having arrived late and unpacked we had to pack up again and be moved to another room the hotel sorted it quickly but inconvenient having to be moved all amenities should be checked prior to arrival to avoid this
