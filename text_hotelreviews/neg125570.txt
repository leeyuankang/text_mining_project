i booked a queen suite however was extremely dissapointed to find the bed was only a double i confronted reception who offered us free breakfast but no offer to put us in the correct room at breakfast the service is shockingly bad we sat out on the terrace and i had to go looking for for cuttlery and glaases for drinks when people inside were waited on at tables would never reccomend to anyone
