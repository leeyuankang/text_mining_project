breakfast on the sunday was very busy people staying at the hotel we turned up at and we had to queue for a table and then we had to queue again for a cooked breakfast not enough staff to cope with the demand which resulted in uncleared tables no plates and glasses at the food stations and not very happy customers though once you got your food it was very good with a wide selection on offer location was a bit too far out for central london but once we located the right tube line at canary wharf situated within the shopping centre which is a bit of a maze we managed to get into covent garden
