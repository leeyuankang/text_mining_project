in the past if i ve booked a docklands hotel it s usually walking distance from canary wharf i booked this hotel in error this hotel should be titled hilton surrey quays not hilton docklands as this was misleading our taxi driver which cost us a fortune as the boat was on a break said a lot of people make the same mistake on arrival the reception had no record of our booking luckily i had my paperwork and email on me however they had no record of me bringing my children even though i remember i had to input their ages when i made the booking to be fair the hotel rectified this and put my husband kids and i in a very spacious bedroom suite my parents however mum was celebrating her birthday were put in a tiny room overlooking the carpark and was kept awake till with crowds leaving the hotel and car doors slamming lesson learnt read the address of this hotel don t just look at the title and assume
