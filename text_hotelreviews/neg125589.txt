the heating on our room was extremely loud all night to the point i could not sleep i called reception but the phone was not working also so i had to go to reception in pjs which was quite a walk away i was told there was an issue with the heating and nothing could be done other than a refund of of my room rate i had to call to chase this up and not even of what i paid was refunded
