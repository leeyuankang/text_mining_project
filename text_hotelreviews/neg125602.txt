there was a horribke horrible smell in the room it was horrible we were told when we arrived that we have to have an adapted for disabilities room we said we did not want that so we had to wait for half an hour for a normal room we then tried to phone reception about the smell and it just kept ringing no answer the bedsheets did not look clean drinking glasses were dirty it was freezing cold i was very disappointed as it was not cheap i would rate the hotel and a half star
