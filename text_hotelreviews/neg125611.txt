there was a confusion with room service and our door number and our pizza and sandwhich s took over an hour to reach us so when it did it was cold we requested a taxi to be called from reception they said the earliest any taxi could get here was a minute wait when we had somewhere to be we requested on the phone please could you call us if it arrives early we will come down minutes before it s due we waited and no taxi came we then had to que for a further minutes to speak with reception who did not take any responsibility and we explained that we needed to be somewhere and we were made to feel in the wrong a lovely taxi driver picked us up and explained there was not a minute wait on taxi s leaving us to miss part of our venue and feel very disappointed with the service
