bad points are staff only seemed to be member of staff on front desk meaning i had to queue to sign in came down in morning and asked guy on reception when next ferry was free service he took a while to find out surely he should know then when i got off other side i got stopped and asked for a ticket the guy should have told me i needed a ticket when i asked him the times i obviously wouldn t have thought i needed a ticket as it s a free service and literally goes from the hotel to other side of river it s not as though you could have jumped on half way the woman insisted i proved to her i stayed at the hotel it s the only place i could have come from she wouldn t call them for me to check either also apparently the maid barged in on my boyfriend even though he had shouted to say he was in there and not to come in
