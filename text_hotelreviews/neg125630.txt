water bottles in our room were not replaced after the first night had dinner on the rooftop terrace on friday night we were escorted to our seat by a lovely friendly waiter however service after this was appalling we were asked by our waitress to provide a credit card as our room didn t have credit she then took my credit card away with her to keep until we had finished i didn t feel comfortable with this so i asked for it back from another member of staff after a long wait to find someone after our meal well about mins after we had finished the waitress came over to the table to collect our plates lifted them up and set them back down on the edge of the table while she went to another two tables to serve other people without excusing herself each time cutting it short and ignore diners to move to the next table she then cleared an empty table and disappeared for about minutes before returning to our table to remove the dirty plates we had to ask her for the dessert menu and the bill and ended up going to the bar to pay as she took so long getting back to us she seemed flustered and appeared to be the only one serving the whole terrace which shouldn t be the case on a friday night our bill was wrong as we had been charged higher prices for our food and drink than were stated on the menu this was resolved but took a while to sort this whole fiasco ruined our evening and took away from the outstanding food we received
