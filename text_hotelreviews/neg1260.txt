the room itself was clean and of a good size but lacked in any form of character it felt like a place for business rather than somewhere you would go for lesiure it was a stereotypical hotel room very basic design art on the walls you d expect to be in every other room no character or unique qualities the view from our room was also dissapointing a concrete wall it made the room very dark however not all rooms can have a view and that is understandable in this instance i was after something more romantic but for those who aren t this hotel is perfect and cannot be faulted for its cleaniliness and quality of staff
