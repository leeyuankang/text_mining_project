after booking in advance for two months through booking com the reception was cold because it was discounted the hotel dont care about the guest i guess i wont be booking through booking com again the reaction is the same in all the hotels booked through booking com the exception was novotel den hague netherlands that allowed me in to my room as soon i arrived even though it was early morning novotel den hague rocks because the hotel showed their human side everything must not be about money everytime
