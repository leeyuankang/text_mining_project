we were put into a smoking room that smelled strongly of stale cigarette smoke i requested to be moved into a non smoking room apparently there were no free non smoking rooms and i was offered a can of air freshener instead very professional a quick check on booking com and the hotel website told a different story ample free rooms i then spoke to a different manager who after a few minutes of searching upgraded us to a bigger suite the initial room we stayed in needed a lot of work and was shoddy to say the least damp patches loose cable fixtures dirty carpets for a junior suite in a supposedly star hotel i would expect more in saying that there were a few good things location of the hotel is very food breakfast was good maybe i just got unlucky but after doing some more research and reading a lot of reviews i am not the first person to have had this massively disappointing experience a few words of advice for the hotel please inform your potential customers when they are making the booking whether the room they have chosen is smoking permitted or not do not offer the guest a can of air freshener as a solution to the problem under no circumstances should you lie to the guest about the availability of rooms or lack thereof in the hotel kindest regards patrick
