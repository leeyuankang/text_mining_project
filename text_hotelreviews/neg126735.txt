bathroom extras shower cap etc missing empty boxes buffet breakfast on first day had no product available to eat and by the time fresh was cooked we missed our first meeting on second day breakfast was served cold which was a shame as it was well cooked staff told us we were in the car congestion charge area and we wasted minutes trying to pay for the charge to then be told by another staff member we were not in the charge area staffs accents were hard to understand and some staff spoke no english at all we drank some cocktails they were very poor some of the common areas of the hotel bar and chairs in resturant are very tired
