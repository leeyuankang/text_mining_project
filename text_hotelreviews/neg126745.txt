it had a faulty towers quality initially the fridge and kettle didn t work we wanted to make a cup off tea we found the problem to be the power point which had burnt out we had to look under the fridge and there was a whole lot of rubbish swept under there bottle tops etc very off putting we called reception reported all of that and they responded quickly enough but missed the point each time sending a new kettle new glasses and finally a repair man the cleanliness issue was never addressed once we experience an issue with cleanliness i m afraid it tarnishes the whole experience of the hotel and we experienced the stay as doing time rather than enjoying the hotel the decor was ornate but again a closer look and the windows were filthy and broken the gold and black marble spa bath was held together by loose panels of board the chair was wobbly and worn through to the stuffing lastly the breakfast was hugely expensive we took the opportunity to enjoy breakfast elsewhere at a fraction of the price all up we couldn t recommend this hotel and i think it is the symptom of a bigger problem which is that london hotels get away with it not ok
