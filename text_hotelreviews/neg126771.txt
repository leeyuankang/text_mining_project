there were one or two minor repairs needed in the bathroom wobbly tap and no make up mirror in my daughter s room considering the price of the roooms it would have been useful to have had some indication as to whether the nibbles provided were complimentary or to be paid for as part of the minibar service it would also be useful to have a price list provided for the minibar this particularly useful as the lovely bar area that we would have liked to have used was not open to hotel residents on the night that we stayed because of a private party we had not been informed of this ahead of our stay and could have chosen a different hotel had we known we were given the option to sit in the foyer area of the hotel and have drinks brought up from the bar however this was a rather cold and draughty area that was brightly lit and whilst lovely in the day time does not give the same ambiance as a cosy bar in the evening the breakfast was expensive but was very good and there was plenty of choice the lady who served the breakfast was the friendliest memeber of staff the others were all most polite but a little bit stiff maybe that s a reflection of the clientel to whom the hotel usually appeals
