i think it would ve been nice to be given instruction on the wi fi when we arrived it appeared to be simple our devices looked liked it was connected but then service didn t happen as it turns out you need to enter a code that the hotel provides to get the access but there is nothing that tells you that we went for days thinking the system was just overloaded and it made it challenging to make plans for our visit since we weren t connecting to the internet anyway discovered the answer an hour before we left i think it should have been presented to us on arrival
