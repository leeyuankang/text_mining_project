a little bit shabby around the edges my bill was not broken down and itemised fully on a consolidated bill card was charged and preauthorised and payments were taken a number of times i therefore had to check after checking out which was a bit embarrassing and still am not sure whether i have been charge properly as i didn t get a receipt for my room only for the extras i had on two different bills its a small matter but i wish it had been dealt with more efficiently as i felt uncomfortable as if i was distrusting the hotel when actually i only wanted receipts for my accounts
