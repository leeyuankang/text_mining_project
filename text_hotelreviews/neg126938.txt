our room could only be described as a box in the basement with a cupboard for the ensuite very very small no view from the window other than a brick wall even the guy on reception couldn t find the room as it was right at the end of a corridor luckily we were travelling early in the morning so it was just a bed for the night this was all part of a birthday surprise for my husband and the extortionate amount i paid i d have been better in an ibis because the rooms are larger at least you know what you re getting from the start very disappointed wont use again
