i had asked for my check out to be delayed by an extra hours due to a flight delay and the receptionist said i would have to pay pounds per hour which is absolutely fine however on the day of check out i received a call from reception that i have only hour extra because they were fully booked i found this ridiculous had they said this earlier i could have made alternate arrangements overpromises are not nice because it resulted in my rushing to pack up and not being able to shower before a hour flight
