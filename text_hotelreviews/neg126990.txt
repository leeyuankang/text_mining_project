without exaggeration i didn t think a hotel could ever create a room smaller than a cruise ship but the rooms are incredibly small a double bed is smaller than a us full size and there is only room to walk up to the bed on one side although the finishes are new and luxurious i ve had more room to move about when tent camping only one small stool to sit on and no place for suitcases we were tripping into each other during our entire stay the bathrooms were modern and recently remodeled with high end finishes but so small that actually hard to use both the toilet and the shower also the drains did not work properly in both rooms we had so sinks and shower filled up during use our first room was on the third floor which is actually flights up with no elevator the staff was very accommodating to give us a room accessible by elevator on the second day this was the most expensive hotel of our european vacation far exceeding madrid barcelona and ireland in price it s a very old building which has been re done as a hotel the location was pretty good and london hotels are very expensive just be aware of the pros and cons before booking read other reviews and when they say small rooms know that they are tiny
