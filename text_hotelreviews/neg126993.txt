room was billed as a deluxe twin room picture alongside description looked fine that was not what we got this room should have been a single beds were head to head zero room to walk or open suitcase it really was disgraceful when asked about the description hotel staff said that deluxe means the same as standard are you kidding for nites felt as though we were taken advantage of we explained that this was misrepresentation they offered us a per cent discount we said that we would rather write and warn people unless they change the description then they told us it was what booking com wrote not the hotel s description well where did booking com get the room description they did offer to change our room after we had figured out how to place things in the room we were too tired after traveling all day to do that for just another nite i would never book with them again ever
