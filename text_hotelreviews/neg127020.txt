the images of the rooms on the internet did not match with reality i paid for a tiny room in the basement which had an unpleasant smell masked by air freshener or cleaning agent when i expressed my disappointment i was later handed a letter of apology and four pieces of fruit by way of compensation this was wholly inadequate as a frequent visitor to london i shall never stay in your hotel again and will not recommend it either
