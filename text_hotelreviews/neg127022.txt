on arrival i was allocated a basement room which i did not like ok for a night or two but not for a day stay after three nights i requested a move and was quickly accommodated in a top floor room with a view and wonderful daylight my delight at this move completely overshadowed any disappointment i may had at the beginning and i can only compliment the reception staff for their fantastic response and understanding
