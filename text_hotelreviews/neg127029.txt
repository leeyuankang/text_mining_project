i knew i had booked a compact double but thought that referred to the room not the bed itself the bed was tiny and my husband and i ended up sleeping top to tail in order to have enough room the room was so tiny that the bed was up against the wall window meaning you have to climb over one another to get in and out there was a loose mattress topper and sheet on the bed so as you turned over it all bunched up and the bed appeared to be on a slope or the mattress was worn basically very uncomfortable the curtains were set into the window at the top but we re longer than the window so hung at an angle this sounds like a picky criticism but when the bed is right up against this window it means that the early morning light shines right in your eyes as you try to sleep and just a really little thing that doesn t really matter but just seems wrong biscuits fruit and water in the room on the first day only why i paid the same amount each night
