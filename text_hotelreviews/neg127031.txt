there are some noise from the cleaning staff also my room was close to the staff room and i can hear the door opining and closing all day also i ask for extending my staying for few more hours than the checking time they accept for two hours only and they charge me pounds for each its much higher than the usual rate since other hotels charge for four hours such as a very close and nice hotel near by called mercure hyde park hotel also there is a staff lady at the reception i really hate her attitude she was really rude i am not sure about her name either marlien or daniel
