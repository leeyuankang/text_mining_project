the room is small but it s typical for london we never took breakfast in the hotel a because nice places with good english or whichever breakfast are in walking distance and at a more reasonable price b the place for breakfasts and a bar and a part of a hallway all in one had bad ventilation and always was full of smells it was neither good for the guests passing by to the elevators nor for the guests having breakfast
