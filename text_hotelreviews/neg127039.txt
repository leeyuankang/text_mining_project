i was disappointed with the size of the room given that it was supposed to be a deluxe double room luckily we were only staying overnight i wouldn t have liked to have been staying for longer with such limited space we also thought there was a restaurant at the hotel it was pouring with rain and we didn t really want to venture out the receptionist recommended a good italian restaurant within walking distance but she did not encourage us to eat at the hotel bar
