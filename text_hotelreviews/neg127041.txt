breakfast was not good do not pay the for breakfast it is so not worth it and very poor the room was super tiny for the price that we paid for it was definitively not worth it value for money was not good the bed was along side walls no space to move around had to jump in and out of bed and try not to wake up my husband as i was trying to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night just know that everything was so compact in that room even the bathroom if you re doing anything you re grazing the walls so very very uncomfortable location was ok walking distance from paddigton station which was the only good thing about this hotel also the staff at the reception were so rude unfriendly and not accommodating at all which you wouldn t expect this from a hotel i don t know if the receptionist was having a bad day but we have never been checked in with such unfriendliness also it does not mention that the the rooms are in another building just annoying than anything else i will definitively not be coming back here only if you find an amazing deal you should book here and not expect anything nice but if you can t find a better deal at this hotel my advise book somewhere else
