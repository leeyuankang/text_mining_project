the size of the room almost ruined our vacation no space for two people to pass by one another not to mention the luggage basically there was no space to open it properly the bed was sticked to the window therefore there was no possibility to get out of the bed on both sides no room view if we were to open it or look outside we would have seen nothing but walls
