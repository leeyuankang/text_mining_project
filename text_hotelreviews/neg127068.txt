at first i was accomodated in a ground floor room in the main building i reminded them that during reservation i requested a non ground floor it seems that they don t receive the requests made at booking com i was reallocated to a different building across the street on a high floor no elevators the add says that the hotel has elevators at least the staff carried my luggage to and from the room this building looks a lot inferior than the main one uglier interior no hall no front desk then safety perception decreased not good arriving late night at a building with no front desk at least key card required to enter no elevator it is far unfair that we pay the same price to stay in such inferior building the room is very small but i must say that it seems to be normal in london the bathroom had almost no space the space between the shower box and the sink is too narrow can barely fit a person with arms down quite a chalenge to brush the teeth or comb your hair the shower drain was partially plugged so after min of shower i had to turn it off before the shower box overboard and flood the bathroom floor had to live with it for days before they sent someone to fix it narrow space between the bed and the walls on both sides
