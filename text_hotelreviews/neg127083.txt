the room was totally cramped the light of the fire alarm as disturbing my sleep despite the comfortable bed the free wifi was asking for too many personal questions which i did then not use it is not acceptable to ask such questions on a free and therefore unprotected wifi i suggest another system for the hotel besides i was glad not to have had much luggage this hotel is not suitable for people who cannot carry luggage along the maze of stairs also since the room and bathroom had been newly done why was there carpet in the room that is so outdated and not hygienic why was there zero space in the bathroom the sink looks nice but is quite an nuisance for space
