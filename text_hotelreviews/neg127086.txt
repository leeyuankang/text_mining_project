i m absolutely appalled at the fact i booked online with my debit card and the pre authorisation amount was taken which was gbp not a problem but when i arrived on the march i paid on my credit card the same amount the staff said they would reimburse the amount onto my debit card as otherwise i would have paid twice i gave it a week and it didn t go back on i have now phoned have spoke to the duty manager and have even emailed print screens of my online baking personal statements which have all my ingoings and outgoings on to prove i haven t relieved the back onto my debit card it s beyond a joke now i ve been told i ll be contacted many many times and i haven t is a lot of money and i m still month on waiting to receive that amount of money back
