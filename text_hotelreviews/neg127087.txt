parking at the property is very poor with all local parking for residents with permits there were active traffic wardens in the area and a number of cars with tickets so i wouldn t dream of chancing it local multi story car parks were available but for a high price at per hours as we were staying for night this would have been expensive but we decided to park around miles away from the hotel in a nice area with free on street parking and got the underground to the hotel the car was very safe
