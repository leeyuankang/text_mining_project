when i arrived they said there was a maintenance problem with one of the rooms i had booked and they were going to move me to another hotel i had already had bookings fail that week having paid in advance for each and awaiting refunds i was also supposed to have paid no deposit but they had taken pre authorisation for the first night despite not having a room for me i m normally a pushover but in this instance i just insisted that they give us rooms on their property and if they had a shortage then they would just have to upgrade us which they did i wish they d offered that to begin with
