getting to the rooms was very inconvenient no lift was available for our part of the building so we had to go up and down multiple stairs to find our room after nights we were well ready to leave we also had an incident with the hotel taxi where we were significantly overcharged we booked one for people but were charged for even though it was clear there were just of us they just did not seem to understand why we were unhappy with this
