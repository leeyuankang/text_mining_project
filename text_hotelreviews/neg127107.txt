when checking in there were separate guests complaining about something while the staff seemed to handle it well it was a bit concerning we also witnessed another disagreement the following day we had a slight problem checking in as they request the same credit card used for booking which we no longer had so we had to be recharged and refunded which caused some issues with exchange rates however this was corrected by the staff
