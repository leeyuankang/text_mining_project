we booked as you said disabled friendly but it wasn t showers were very slippy even with a towel on floor there was stairs to our room and also we went for breakfast on day and it was down stairs with no handrails so we didn t go on second day as we couldn t safely use the stairs we was very disappointed as when looking for hotel we stated disabled friendly i wouldn t book this hotel again because of the stairs
