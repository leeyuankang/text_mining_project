although i requested a room with a view on arrival we were allocated a tiny room with no window we requested another room and were given a second room with a window facing a brick wall after speaking to the manager we were eventually moved to a club room and had a comfortable stay however i found the attitude of alice appalling she questioned why we were moving rooms and pulled a face she then muttered something to her colleague very unprofessional
