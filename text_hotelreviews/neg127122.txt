we ordered room service of a chicken burger and nachos they arrived cold but on very hot plates the nachos came virtually glued to the plate and were hard and unpleasant the sauces with it curdled in their little jugs we did eat it because we were hungry but mentioned that they might like to review that service the next morning at checkout to their credit the hotel didn t charge us for the food and apologised
