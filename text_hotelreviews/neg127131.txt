only very minor points to make i asked for a pint of water at breakfast as with most hotels only very small glasses were laid out and i don t drink tea and coffee only water so i always request this but there seemed to be some confusion over what i was asking for and eventually i was just given a slightly taller glass empty also a deposit charge is taken on check in but when booking breakfast it couldn t just be added on to the room but the credit card was asked for again an unnecessary process the bar shuts at which is a bit too early for hotel guests
