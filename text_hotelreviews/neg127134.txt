the layout of the rooms in the hotel was odd we had to walk up a short flight of steps to get to the elevator take the elevator to the floor then walk down a lengthy staircase to get to our room this is not a hotel for those who can t deal with stairs next time i will ask for a room on the same floor as the elevator
