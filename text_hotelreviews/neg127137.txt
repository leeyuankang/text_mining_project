the bathroom design is extremely unreasonable the basin area is less than meter wide and i could barely brush my teeth comfortably since my elbow would hit on the walls btw i am only in size so just imagine how it would feel for guys there is no where to put your toilette in either basin area or in shower the dust bin in bathroom is hard to open and in fact i didn t manage to open it besides the hotel rooms are in the opposite building to where the lobby is located and there is no lift so you will need to climb up to floors via a super narrow staircase
