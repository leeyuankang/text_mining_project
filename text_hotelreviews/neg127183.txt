confusion when booking in as told initially that breakfast was included on speaking with reception the following day i was told breakfast was not included and i had only booked in for one night instead of two on challenging this i asked them to look again they then confirmed i had booked for two nights but i was not entitled to breakfast on checking out i noticed i had been charged for two breakfasts even though i had been told i was not entitled to breakfast and i had not taken breakfast spoke with two reception staff and they said my card would be credited and new invoice with the breakfast costs removed would be emailed to my personal email as yet two days later no email with new invoice received bit disappointing as hotel it self is good
