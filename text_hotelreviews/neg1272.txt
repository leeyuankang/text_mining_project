the only thing was that i had asked for a piece of chocolate cake with candles a and a and was promised that it would be taken care off but when we arrived at the hotel i was told that there is no chocolate cake and that they dont have candles a bit dissapointed there cause i would have taken care of it if not promised otherwise
