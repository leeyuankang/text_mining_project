we found that every morning we were being awoken by doors closing and that the housekeepers were very noisy we understand they have a job to do but would of appreciated not hearing thier conversations and them going about their daily routine quite as much my boyfriend was ill during the trip and was finding it hard to sleep as it was without the crashing and banging quite early in the mornings
