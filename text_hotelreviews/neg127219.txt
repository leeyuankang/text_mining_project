the desk was a compromise as quite small and difficult for doing work i really didn t like the handy smartphone that was in the room the screen constantly changed drawing attention to itself and i could see no simple way of turning it off this also made it difficult to get to sleep as it was putting off a lot of light in a small room i didn t like the idea of a device with cameras on it being in the room my room was also on the third floor with only stair access thank goodness for the porter helping carry my bag to the room
