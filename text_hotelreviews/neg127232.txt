the room we were given was very small so we changed room to a slightly bigger one to find that come night time the window in the room was that thin the room was very drafty plus the air conditioning units were outside our window so that kept is up aswell as having to juggle with the heating to keep the room warm so we didn t sleep very well when we booked the room one of the offers were pay when we arrived but the hotel took money from my account before we arrived and then i had to pay for the room when we got there so full price for the room aswell as them taking the so rather than paying the which is what i thought we were paying i ended up paying which i m still not happy about plus i still haven t had the refunded yet
