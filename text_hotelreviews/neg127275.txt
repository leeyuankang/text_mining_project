the room was very small and due to the lay out bed up against window was quite claustrophobic as the person sleeping on the window side had to climb over the other to get out the carpet in the hall and room was visibly dirty the access to the room was terrible aside from getting the lift to the correct floor we had to walk along several hallways and open doors with suitcases this was very awkward the bathroom and location were good apart from this i would not stay there again for the price it was very disappointing
