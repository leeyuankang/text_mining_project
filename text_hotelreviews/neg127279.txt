the room was a bit small but that was fine the one thing i couldn t stand was the lack of noise insulation my room was right next to the door separating the lift lobby and the main corridor and i could hear that banging shut the entire night even if i had requested a room further away i would still have heard the room doors opening and closing the walls were that thin
