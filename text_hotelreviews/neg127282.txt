the room was so small the bed was at best a large single bed would not call it a double bed not much room for a couple bathroom was tiny no room in the shower and certainly not enough room to dry yourself the room was also small not much room for people to move around there was a loud annoying noise coming from outside the room which might have been some air conditioning units but when we called to complain about this the noise stopped but then started again minutes later and continued on and off throughout the night not sure why there was a window in the room when all there was to look at was the peoples room opposite and some brick walls
