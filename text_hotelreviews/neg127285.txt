i spent days in a single deluxe the room was extremely small and the little window was locked perfect if you want to try the experience of being in prison upon arrival i asked if the room they had given me was really a deluxe and i have confirmed that it was they offered me to see other rooms but they told me they were the same size other guests complained the answer was that in london the rooms were that size it is absolutely not true to avoid
