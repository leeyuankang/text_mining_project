the draft coming from the window in the bedroom was bad even with the heating on i found sleeping on the window side of the bed very cold the bar seats weren t very comfortable and it lacked atmosphere even though it was decorated lovely we definitely would have stayed longer and spent more if we had been a little more comfortable
