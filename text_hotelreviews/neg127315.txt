starting with the lady i spoke to in reservations who pretty much didn t care if we stayed or didn t she was very rude and put me right off reception was basically made up of all trainees who were particularly friendly at all robotic and did not make me feel welcome at all breakfast again was a let down room was alright but for i felt i should have shopped around more for a hotel which is able to deliver better service lucky for us it was only the one night we stayed so it didn t ruin our time in london but i would not recommend or stay again myself
