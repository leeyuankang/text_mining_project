it would have been nice to have been in the main hotel for the convenience as this is why i booked it in the first place i was given a tiny room in the basement facing the main road the room was ok for a couple of nights as i was out all day but i had to eat my dinner on the bed as it was so small i was a little disappointed as this was supposed to be a double deluxe room the prices should be lower to reflect the lack of space also for breakfast is extortionate
