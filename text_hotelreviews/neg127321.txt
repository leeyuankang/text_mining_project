the status lights of the fire system in the ceiling and the electronic do not disturb system are so bright that one can see around the room at night not enough to read by but very disturbing i had to use a sleep mask the room temperature seemed difficult to lower and ventilation rates seemed poor through the built in ducting the sash window could be opened but had restraints limiting it to a few inches a very thick duvet meant that i was too hot to sleep comfortably the compact rooms are too small to fit in not a chair there is merely a stool for the desk
