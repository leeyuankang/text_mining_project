we reserved a deluxe twin room but at arrival they gave us a very small double room we asked to change room they promised will do that in time the first night was too difficult tomorrow they upgraded to a good room but they asked me a different charge for upgrading i have insisted by presenting my booking com confirmation so they did that without any other fees i am a booking com frequent client and it was really a commercial behavior
