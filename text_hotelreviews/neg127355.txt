we were initially put in room across the road from main building absolutely awful miniscule could not move around the bed with two of us tiny window wet bath mat towel in leaking shower tiny curtains that were hanging off the track absolutely nothing like the picture of the deluxe room i had paid for which i had on my phone i complained and was moved to room in main building which was ok but still quite small this should never have happened i was disgusted that we were being ripped off in this way we would never stay there again because they tried to pull a fast one would not recommend it to anyone be warned ask if you will be in the main building in the room you have paid for i had booked this months ago so it was not a last minute thing disgusted
