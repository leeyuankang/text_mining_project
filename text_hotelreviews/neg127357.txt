the rooms are really small and sometimes the shower door is partially blocked by the sink i had to squeeze myself in the wifi is weak and many of the rooms are in the basement and ground floor which makes the windows blocked by nearby buildings and the sun doesn t shine through the rooms very well i suggest you request a room in the upper floors
