the lack of lift in the opposite block of the hotel i complained about this but was told the porter would take care of my luggage which they did on the first night however upon checking out because i was on the third floor the porter ripped my suitcase apart in the process of assisting with my luggage it s so sad that i was not notified until i got to the airport
