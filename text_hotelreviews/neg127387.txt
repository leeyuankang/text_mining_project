for a star hotel we were very disappointed in the layout of the sleeping room we were there for a week but there was no room for the second suitcase no chest of drawers the space instead was taken up with a useless bar fridge also a nice but useless leather bench at the end of the bed could have had some drawers or shelves but was really just in the way i think the management should re think the room layout
