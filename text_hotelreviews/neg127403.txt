there was a mix up when it came to checking us in to our room so the process took over an hour it was eventually dealt with but at no point were we offered much of an apology or a drink at the bar while they sorted out the mess which was disappointing the shower door in our room didn t close properly wither but it didn t affect the quality of the stay overall
