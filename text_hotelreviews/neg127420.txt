although i am a frequent customer of the hotel for over two years i am denied the chance to change my dates although i have offered to pay additional charges on the new rates for the new dates if they were higher just because i made a mistake and choose during reservation non cancelable option i was not given the chance to correct my reservation dates even though i called both booking com and the hotel with in an hour time and even telling me that it would be possible if i call them when my new dates are fixed so for this reservation the hotel charged me for the two nights that i did not stay this is not a big sum but in principle shows how both booking com and the hotel considers its customers a simple considerate approach would not have hurt them and they could have been better off by charging me a bit more but instead they choose to be an un customer friendly hotel and acted with zero empty it is a shame that a hotel i enjoyed staying does this to a loyal customer
