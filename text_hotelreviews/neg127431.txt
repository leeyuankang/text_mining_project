room size the standard and delux room size are literally pigeon holes no space to put a bag for size of total for person the site is showing on actual they are half the size declared on booking am not the only one who was complaining other group from china and middle east had similar concerns to this resolution to that please upgrade to higher corporate rooms at extra charge da add to that if you enter the bathroom in the corporate rooms size the biggest size you cannot close the doors because there is no space for that indian staff front desk counter especially the men ones should all be replaced with east european staff since they don t resemble any business sense and have no welcoming attitude and they are not a face for business at all rude not supportive and clampers my next destination was paris i stayed in holiday inn paris and i booked the standard double bed with room size the room size is extra bigger than the corporate size largest room in park grand court hotel clearly there is a rip off plan by the hotel management i advise the management to remove the word grand from the name since it does not resemble any meanings i was supposed to stay between aug to i had to cancel the last night they charged me for that night and they also charged me for the upgrade from pigeon hole rooms to corporate can t say more we all know it s a season and the hotel management wants to make money but hey guys there is something called feedback social media and customer loyalty which am sure this hotel is so far from it they are basically hit and run approach type kind of thing good luck with your business and i would never recommend your hotel to anyone
