we were put in a club room across the road from reception which was fine however the room smelt of cigarettes and being right near the front door we heard the door banging loudly throughout the night we had a duvet that was too small for the bed the breakfast room was in a basement area our coffee cups were not clean and the wall was spattered with either old coffee stains or food
