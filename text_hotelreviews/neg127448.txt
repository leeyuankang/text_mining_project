the room i was given was on lower ground so no view other than a wall and fire exit also not the best that when the curtains are open people are passing through and able to see you in bed the worst thing about the room was hearing everyone s toilet flush woke up at with the sound of water trickling in the pipes behind the wall the pda provided wouldn t work either could have been a great help as well
