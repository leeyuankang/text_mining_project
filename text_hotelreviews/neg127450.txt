the unhelpfulness of the staff i arrived after a hour flight on sunday evening i was exhausted and on the way didn t find any exchange centres open the reception insisted i pay for the full stay than and in pounds i gave several options such as i ll pay for the first two nights and the third i ll pay tomorrow i ll keep a deposit in usd for the third night until tomorrow i ll cancel the third night i ll pay the full amount in usd the reception refused any or a combination of the choices i was forced to look for an open exchange centre i felt that the staff wasn t willing to make things easier to even try to the hotel consists of several small building no elevator which was ok with me just three flights up it was small the room the staircase and the entrance to our building smelled like alcohol and weed overall i wouldn t stay there again because of that first night
