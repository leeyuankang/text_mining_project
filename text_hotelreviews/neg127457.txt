on arrival all signs were good we were greeted warmly by one member of staff who handed us over to another member of staff that s where the niceties ended when being checked in we were not spoken to the whole process took about minutes and the woman who checked us in did not explain anything we were signing or why they needed other information it was lucky we were taken to our room because we definitely wouldn t have found it on our own when we opened the door to say we were disappointed was an understatement the room was so small there was no where to put our small suitcase the bed was not a standard double and was totally unsuitable for two adults the length was uncomfortable for my partner who is under the bed was shoved against the window which meant that the window could not really be opened the air con was loud or we suffered the heat checking out took a long time we were pleased to see the back of the hotel we certainly would not stay again
