they stuck us in a horrible tiny room with a small bed the room had no window and it was located in an old section of the hotel that smelled toxic what was even more weird there were curtains on the wall but when u open the curtains there was a wall behind it not a window very disappointed will never go back there it felt like an episode of american horror story
