the questionable stain on the headboard of the bed that looked like the aftermath of a couple s night of fun the so called deluxe room is supposed to be bigger than the compact room but you couldn t swing a cat in there the tv wasn t working properly half the screen was dull grey while the bathroom was modern the shower was so small could barely move made me feel almost claustrophobic the air conditioning the dial was in the useless corridor between entry to room and outdoor corridor which took up valuable room space if they knocked out that wall the room would of been a decent size as opposed to in the room so had to go into the corridor to keep turning it off and on even on it s lowest fan setting it blew gale force winds so had to keep turning it on and off i was very sick during my stay and can absolutely guarantee that this contributed to my slow recovery the use of ambi pur plug in scent and also the housekeeper s vacuum scent both were completely over powering and not at all pleasant smelling the view from the window was an annex that was very dirty not at all appealing to have the curtain open
