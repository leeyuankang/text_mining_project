little oversights here and there we were a group of three friends staying in one room but the extra bed didn t get made with the same fabulous comforter and they only provided one robe and slippers for the three of us upon request an extra blanket was provided but not a proper comforter and i m sure we could have gotten extra robes as well if we had asked another friend stayed in one of the upgraded rooms with a nespresso machine but the room hadn t been stocked with nespresso pods and it required a call to the front desk a very good place overall as i said it was just little things here and there that keep it from getting an even better score
