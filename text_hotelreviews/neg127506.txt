we have stayed here for nights and apparently it was an disappointed stay the guy who helped us with luggages told us soft drinks will be refilled for free daily however we didn t get this service on the second day and it was the same case on the third day i approached to the receptionist and i was told with a face shows i was stupid to ask the drinks including water are only served on the first night which was different from the welcoming words and this arrangement is weird too i m not paying cheaper rates on the or night why i don t get the same service as i had the first day the toilet was not working well it keeps flushing and you can t stop it by pushing the bottom as you might concern about the water waste this noise won t allow you to fall asleep when we have finally checked out the staff took me and my uber driver mins to get my stored luggage back if i knew their service was this slow i wouldn t ask them for this service
