on arrival despite booking a superior double room we were given a twin room on valentine s day when we went back to reception to tell them they had made a mistake the receptionist s quick solution was to say can we push them together for you top marks for thinking on he feet but no eventually got given a different room two floors down the bathroom towels were stained and dirty marks on the ceiling in the bathroom room service was very slow and the champagne glass had a chip which was very sharp we were informed breakfast was served until on checking however on monday when going down to the restaurant at we were ushered away saying they were closed as they were only open until at the weekend per person the iron in the room was broken this was replaced but the old one didn t get removed and got kept in the corner of the room hoping this was only a one off
