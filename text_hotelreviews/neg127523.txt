not impressed with the receptionist who received us on arrival hardly raised a smile other reception staff we spoke to were very helpful and friendly we were unlucky with our room which was in the basement with a poor outlook very pokey for a deluxe double hotel has a very small lounge so nowhere nice to relax except for the small bar area all staff in these areas very nice
