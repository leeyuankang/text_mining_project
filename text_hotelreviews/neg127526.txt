really disappointed with the room we were given for the money we paid it took ages to check us in despite requesting early check in this was not mentioned we arrived at usual check in time but there did not seem to be a room for us eventually we were shown to a room across the road room which was in the basement very claustraphobic stuffy we paid for the room it looked out onto a brick wall we had arranged to meet our son there who had stayed the previous night too he had complimentary wine fruit in the room all we had was bottled water besides tea coffee we were on a tight schedule as we were booked into an exhibition so couldn t afford the time to request a room change but we just did not feel that we received good value for money
