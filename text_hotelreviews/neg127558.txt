i didn t like that hotel took preauthorisation from my bank account even when i picked during the booking option pay on arrival no prepayment is going to be taken i has been taken when i notice i rang hotel and they transfer me to really rude guy screaming at me that it s a hotel policy and its my fault that i can t read i certainly can read booking com solved the problem and hotel accept my conditions i spent hours on phone with hotel and booking then on arrival everything was ok until i checked that this pre authorisation is still pending on my bank account the receptionist made me a favour and put her screen with attitude on desk saying oh look on our website it says that we will take preauthorisation luckily it was our last day and i will never stay in this hotel again after my complain to manager they offered me free upgrade to my room i don t plan to say in future with them so i find it useless to try to fix my stay by giving me news papers and other stuff to room i don t want to book never again
