i had the worst sleep experience i ve ever had at a hotel there was noise every night that woke me also the room design is terrible bathrooms are good but the bedroom is awful the end of the bed is so close to the end of the wall that i a small person had to turn sideways and sidestep to get to my side of the bed or i had to crawl over it the closet was designed so that our clothes couldn t hang down all the way without being obstructed the carpet wasn t vacuumed daily the air vent was right over my side of the bed so if we turned the air on for ventilation i froze we booked a deluxe double and arrived to find that we were in a room with two single beds in the back corner looking out at the bottom of a window well complete with old cigarette butt so even though the location is fabulous and the staff was great especially the guest services manager i would never ever stay here again
