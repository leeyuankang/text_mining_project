the room was nice but definitely too small it could be compared to some of the smallest rooms i ve seen in japan for the price paid per night i think i should have been able to go on the other side of the bed without having to walk over it barely had the space to open one single piece of luggage probably not all their rooms are like this but ours was definitely not comfortable for two people
