our original room was disgusting underground in the suite building nothing like the photos on booking com horrible dirty tiled floor sewage smells coming from the bathroom ripped curtains a big metal worktop and kitchen area that looked like something from a horror film ripped wall paper air con didn t work so room was sweltering not good for a pregnant customer i was so shocked at the standard of room we had been put in compared to what was advertised awful when i complained we were moved to a room in the main building it was tiny but at least was clean and air con worked it was decorated in the same style as advertised unlike the original room which felt like the staffs quarters although we were moved i felt it ruined our visit as we felt akward that there was no explanation or apology given so we felt like we were not welcome i simply can not understand how that room could be used under what is being advertised on your site we felt cheated not nice when i d put a note in the booking explaining it was the last few days of our honeymoon
