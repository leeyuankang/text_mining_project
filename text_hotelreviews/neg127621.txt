my stay at this hotel was a nightmare i checked in at pm and was taken to a room in which there was hair on the duvet sheets and pillows on each of the two single beds i politely complained to the staff at the front desk and was taken to another room unfortunately there was hair all over that bed as well i then complained once more and was given a so called suite in the annex across the street this room was dingy and there was a lot of noise coming from an adjacent room but the sheets were at least clean and i was able to fall asleep with ear plugs
