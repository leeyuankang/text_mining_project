room was very small looks nice on the pictures deluxe double room but i ve never encountered a room this small in a hotel because of the small room they need to use really small bed at max as double bed here applies the same as for the room i ve never encountered such a small doublebed in a hotel i was told by the staff that one higher on their standart clubroom or how they call it would have much bettter sizing both room and bed and that the difference is just about pounds a night i was not aware of this it was not clear from the offer on booking com otherwise i would go for it maybe next time
