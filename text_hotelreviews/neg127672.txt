i didn t like the fact i paid for a double room but i just got two twin beds put together but it didn t cause that much of a hassle just something to moan about also as a newly refurbished building it was lovely but in the room the lighting was appalling they need extra lights as it is so dark also by our room door was a door onto a roof but a lower level one as we were basically on the lower ground floor this was simply padlocked but was open like an inch so it didn t make us feel too safe and secure at night as well with the windows these obviously haven t been refurbished as they are so old and not secure also they are full with steam and dew in the morning and get the floor soaked
