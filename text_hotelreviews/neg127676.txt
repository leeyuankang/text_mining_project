overall there was nothing that we didn t like about our stay the only thing if we were being really picky was that the staff were sometimes difficult to understand as they had varying accents however they were accommodating of this and didn t mind repeating themselves they were extremely helpful and friendly also we were placed in a basement room so didn t have a view at all and also book a deluxe double with a bath but were given a club double didn t complain however as the room we were given was lovely
