i didnt like the lay out of the room it was very small with two single beds one at each side one bed had a flat screen tv at the side of it and a large mirror at other side hidden by side of bed so you wouldnt be comfortable watching tv lying in bed and the other bed was situated so far away you wouldnt see tv at all not comfortable if you want to relax in bed also when i booked hotel i requested a late leaving time while i was there i mentioned this again at front desk but unfortunately i was met with a call with a member of staff huffing and puffing as i explained my email request and mentioning at desk that doesn t make me feel relaxed and i don t find that very professional to behave like that to a paying customer especially when i was down in london for important interviews
