we booked separate rooms through booking com this had not been communicated correctly with the hotel and only one room was ready on arrival the staff were very apologetic and dealt with this straight away there was then confusion on check out as to if the room had been paid for we didn t have any nice views from either of our rooms the location of the hotel is in a business district type area
