we had specifically ordered a room with two single beds a deluxe room this was important to us mostly because we needed separate duvets because we can t sleep sharing a double duvet at arrival the staff said that our room had been upgraded and i said that was ok as long as the new room had two single beds they said yes no worries when we got to the room we immediately reacted to it having a double bed with a double duvet we told the porter that we didn t want this room unless we could get another duvet he then went and fetched one extra for us
