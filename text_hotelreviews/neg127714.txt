the picture of the room i booked didn t match the one we were put in we were in the club room which was right next to the maintenance or cleaners room and we could hear everything banging of doors hoovering chatter for someone that s a light sleeper this wasn t helpful i did ask to see the other rooms which the staff were kind enough to show us they were much more newer but the staff made it out that i would be getting a downgrade the bathroom was tiny not much room to manoeuvre in also i ve been to another of park grand s chain in earl s court which was much better so i m comparing to that one
