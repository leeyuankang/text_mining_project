tiny shower cubicle hardly any room to move around in the room due to an oversized bed drainage for what seemed to be half of london running past my head whilst laying in bed i could hear a constant sound of running water breakfast room was poorly laid out once again trying to get too much into a small space i was upgraded to a superior room my mate didn t upgrade and his was bigger than mine and had a decent sized shower
