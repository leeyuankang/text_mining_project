my second stay at the end of my trip was a nightmare at check in the girl behind the counter insisted i had booked two rooms i had booked one deluxe twin and used my phone to cancel the second after giving me attitude during the entire check in process she handed me the room key and says the porter will show me to my single room our twin room had been split into two singles without us being told due to renovations and hence the second room she had just cancelled it would ve been nice to have been informed prior to check in as my friend and i wanted to share a room and would ve possibly booked elsewhere i was also not asked if this was okay when i found out then my friend had to show her id to check into a room i had already paid for got into the single room and there was barely enough room for me to open my suitcase on the floor we went out for breakfast the next day and put the do not disturb sign on the door as we were checking out later that afternoon but could hear housekeeping starting at about o clock as we were walking down the corridor a male member of staff asked me which room i had come from when i stated he said next time don t leave the do not disturb sign on if you re not in there i told him there wasn t going to be a next time there certainly won t in future after being lectured by a member of staff after paying pounds for one night in a room i could barely move my case around in and was separated from my friend and we were coming back after breakfast to pack up and check out our check out time was for however when my friend left her room to visit me at she was locked out of her room we are and years old and were treated like unwelcome teenagers by the staff that s not the service i had come to expect after my two night stay earlier that month must be different staff at the weekend but i left feeling about twelve years old
