we booked a double bedroom we actually got a smaller than double bed and a single bed in the room which we then had to push together so we could both comfortable fit the heating wasn t working so we were cold throughout the night which left us both very tired the next day we paid for breakfast the following morning and couldn t believe how disappointing it was poor selection very poor quality some of the hot food was cold the scrambled egg was runny bacon was barley cooked and more fat than bacon plus it tasted of tomato i m guessing they were cooked on the same griddle but it worries me about any vegetarians that may have gone for the tomatoes so what started a brilliant stay turned into a night mare by the time it came to leaving we were just glad to get out if it hadn t been for the great staff and cleanliness i would have seen the manager
