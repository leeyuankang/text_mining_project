when booking this hotel we ensured we booked the club room as it states this room included a bath for additional money we then did not get that room and was told there was no more rooms available with a bath i then wrote an email to the hotel on our return and said it is not unreasonable for us to ask for the price difference to compensate for the additional facilities we paid for and we had an awful response back saying how they were confused as neither them or booking com state that a bath was included in this room and how we should of made a special request when booking if we wanted a bath i then took a screen shot of the part where it stated on the site that a bath was included and was ignored due to their response i will not be staying again
