i had a single room that was probably the smallest one i have ever had in a hotel nice clean and equipped with everything but difficult to move around with the luggage a little bit claustrophobic also i woke up at a m in the morning because someone next door ordered a bottle of wine and you could clearly hear the staff knocking on their door
