size of the deluxe single room was too small it was in the basement and claustrophobic the air vent at the head rest area was throwing out cold air and the ac in the feet area hot air it was extremely difficult to try and get a comfortable temperature in the room noisy as noise insulation was not good and one could hear all people in the corridor opening and closing door sink space was totally inadequate ending in visitor banging elbows on wall when they try to brush their teeth safe was placed too high no instructions provided and was not working a maintenance guy did come to sort it out but by then i had to take my valuables to reception as i needed to go out my colleague who booked in the same hotel days after i did got a better price a double room on floor and breakfast i was charged more had no breakfast given a small room in the basement i would not visit the hotel again and would not recommend it as my experience was very poor booking com need to consider that clients received through their website are treated differently to clients booking through the hotel website
