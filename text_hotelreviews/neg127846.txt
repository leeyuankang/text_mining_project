the floor of my room wasn t level it was on a slight slope hence the bed was on a slope yep that s right one side of the room was noticeably lower than the other not hugely but you definitely noticed it when you went into the room or lay on the bed i didn t find the room bed comfortable due to this i m sure they d have changed rooms if i d complained but i was tired and didn t fancy moving to another room it wasn t catastrophic by any means but it was enough to make me not want to stay there again just in case
