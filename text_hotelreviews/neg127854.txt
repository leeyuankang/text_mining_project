the hotel room was tiny not compact it had a draughty window which was freezing at night the pillows were hard and the rooms very noisy during the early hours hearing people banging about plus the kettle was broken the breakfast was ok avoid the scrambled eggs and coffee and make sure they don t try to charge you twice the service could do with work we waited a very long time for drinks
