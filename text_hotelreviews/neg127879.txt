scaffolding outside bedroom with workmen looking in the bedroom i had read about this prior to going but was told this would have been finished bedrooms were old and drab plastic stirrer instead of a proper teaspoon there are no hairdryers in the room you have to ring housekeeping and pay which is refunded when you return the dryer horrible uncomfortable beds very rude unhelpful staff that made you feel like you were an annoyance
