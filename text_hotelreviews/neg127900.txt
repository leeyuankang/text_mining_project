after a long day of traveling i finally arrive at the hotel and am told they don t have a room for me and move me to a sister property down the street for the same price they did comp my breakfast for my trouble so i did get some powdered eggs out of it in the room the door to the bathroom wouldn t close due to water damage the bed was so uncomfortable i actually slept on top of the duvet for extra padding i ve never written a bad review for a hotel before but this was a very disappointing experience
