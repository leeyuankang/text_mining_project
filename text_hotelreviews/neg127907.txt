when we arrived rather tired after a long haul flight we were told that due to a maintenance issue the deluxe double room booked was not available they offered us a room in a sister hotel which was some distance away by taxi i was not convinced by their explanation and felt they had either double booked my room or simply sold the room on after my booking anyway after much discussion i was allocated a room eventually the room was tiny and cramped with a shower that saturated the entire bathroom floor from my stay i would comment that the hotel is not anything approaching a star i do not understand how it could have achieved such a rating
