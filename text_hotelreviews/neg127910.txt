tinyness of room size for the cost no lift unbelievably compact room with the only way to open a regular size suitcase being on the bed and then to slide it over the end to just fit on the floor needing to step in the suitcase to open and close the blinds would not be suitable for two people breakfast selection was disappointing compared to other hotels i ve recently stayed at desk was barely large enough to fit my small laptop and mouse and easier to sit on the end of the bed than use the stool provided
