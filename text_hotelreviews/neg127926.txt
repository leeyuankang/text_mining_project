on arrival there was a slight issue as the card i had booked the hotel with had expired this month and a new card had been issued as the reserved payment had already been taken out my account i only should have been paying half the total on arrival however as the hotel did not have my new card details they said they would have to take the full payment out of my new card this i found was unprofessional as it was the same bank account just an updated card i then had to let the hotel staff phone my bank company and ask them to release the reserved payment so they could then take the full amount out of my new card details this had us waiting at reception for around minutes i found this an inconvenience as they should have protocol for situations like this especially as it was not a different account i was using to pay the rest of payment i found the staff slightly rude over this situation and not pleasant
