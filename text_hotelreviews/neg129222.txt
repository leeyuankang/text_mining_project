unfortunately the food and drinks of the roof terrace were pretty expensive euros for an estrella is the most expensive beer i ve ever had the same beer at the most expensive hotels in barcelona were even cheaper than this euros for two beers each for me and my partner is a lot it s a shame there is no discounted rate for hotel guests as i understand you pay a premium for the view but i don t expect to have to spend that much when we are already paying a premium to be a guest it did frustrate me but it wouldn t put me off staying there again i would just drink water another thing is the price of the breakfast only once did we dine at the hotel restaurant for breakfast a relatively small breakfast for cost over euros one of the most expensive meals we had in our entire stay the waitress ordered a coffee for my boyfriend when he actually said he didn t want one and automatically poured us both orange juice without asking they ended up being euros for just one glass so euros each for something we didn t even ask for i assumed it was part of the breakfast deal until i saw the bill their set menu s are great value but because my boyfriend only wanted one dish off the menu and i wanted only one part of another set menu we decided to order individually to reduce the waste if we had shared one set menu it was have just been something euros instead of the pricing just doesn t make sense as we had far less food for double the price it s safe to say i was shocked when the bill arrived a small bread basket with a mini croissant roll and couple of other tiny pastries was well over euros it s best to head next door literally to the most incredible bakery and have an overflowing bag of pastries for just a few euros and great coffee it seems like the negative outweigh the positives but that is not the case
