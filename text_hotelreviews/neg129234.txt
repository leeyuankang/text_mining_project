my room was small definitely not sq meters advertised as deluxe room it also did not have a bath tub which seems odd for a hotel the no disturb button by the bed was so bright that i had to cover it with a towel to be able to sleep the pool opening times are unideal for business travellers closing at and opening at gets hard to enjoy it if you are arriving late after business day and have to depart early in the morning breakfast menu is beyond expensive paid ca euros for one person breakfast a la carte and there is no buffet
