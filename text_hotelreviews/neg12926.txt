frankly we don t understand how this hotel has a star label this should be at most rooms are very small the hotel itself is a bit old the elevator stops between floors so you still have to take a few steps and it is also ridiculously small we could not fit people with our two suitcases and we are small oh and wifi was terribly slow as well
