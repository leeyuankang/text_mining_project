well it s not really a hotel so don t expect those types of amenities there is really no reception when you walk through the front door you literally walk into their bar which is super nice by the way there are very limited food options snacks basically and no dining options although within a few metres from the front door there are several great dining options because i was there on business it should be noted that the bedroom was not so great for doing work the desk is an antique and so was the chair meaning pretty uncomfortable so not great for the business traveler but awesome for a weekend getaway
