i called down for a charger and iron the man on reception asked me to come collect it i explained i was in pj s and he said what do you want me to do then another man walked into my room at the crack of dawn used a key so presumed must have been staff but this woke me up and obviously was quite frightening i told reception the next day and she seemed particularly unmoved by this simply said he must of been staff finally as we left the staff were standing right outside the hotel entrance smoking generally unprofessional quite rude and would not recommend
