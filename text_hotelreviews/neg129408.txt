the hotel told me that my card was declined for security deposit i kept having them re swipe i checked my statement and had been charged five deposits that they said were declined when i went to the front desk to explain i overheard someone having an identical situation it took some time about two weeks for the charges to be removed which was an inconvenience on vacation
