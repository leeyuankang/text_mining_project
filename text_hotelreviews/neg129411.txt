first of all we were charged twice for our room booked once while booking second while check in plus you pay deposit when asked at reception the agent said we will refund your amount which never came through secondly extremely tiny rooms no appropriate place to even keep our luggage for two in a standard room so only fancy pictures don t buy it guys the overall staff of the hotel was rude and dumb especially if you are an international you are screwed because nobody cares to even speak english i know its france but how uneducated and unfriendly third and most common necessity is morning coffee no cafeteria in the hotel to have coffee which is a basic thing found even in the worst rated hotel note you are forced to pay for breakfast to have coffee or either order for room service well talking about it the room service was even more pathetic waited for the coffee like hour and never came the staff especially at reception is highly unpleasant and arrogant overall stay at the hotel for a first visit to paris was highly discomforting and dissatisfying our perception of paris hotels was way different never recommending nor booking this hotel in future negative rating
