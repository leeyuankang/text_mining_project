this hotel isn t stars by my own assessment i had placed a special request for which i received confirmation on prior to arrival but to my dismay it wasn t arranged i also asked for breakfast to be added to my room charge which was also not arranged for nights we decided to stay but if any longer stay we would have moved hotels very far from main paris tourist attractions neighborhood is also not great
