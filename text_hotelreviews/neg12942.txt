not conveniently located from the airport or in to central paris it is eother in a taxi to central paris or a min walk the room was unbelievably small and it comfortable for three people in the family room i paid for one night for a family room but it was not comfortable no small luxuries and not ideally located the fire alarm went off early in the morning which disrupted the breakfast routine we were dragged out of the hotel very early because a chef burnt some toast and set the alarm off from then on there was insufficient breakfast on the counter and it took us nearly an hour of waiting for toast and eggs to arrive overall i was very disappointed with the hotel please don t stay here
