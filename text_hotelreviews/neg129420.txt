the stay was best by not being in the hotel after spending per night i expected a great deal more the hotel is not all all value for money the room was small there is absolutely no way to shower without making the bathroom totally wet there is no views from our room the staff at reception was very unhelpful for example we discovered at the end of our stay that we could have taken a river taxi from across the road staff failed to mention that when asked how to get into town just down right unhelpful which was a shame as the rest of paris helped us to enjoy our stay even staff from office units tried to assist as we walk about enjoying the city i would just never stay at the hotel again very very poor the asking is also a major issue advertised as having parking in the uk does not mean that you then pay for the parking this should be made clear at the point of booking
