very sullen staff both at reception on arrival and departure and on phone answered with a curt oui not even hello no smiles from anyone in the room not much space noisy air conditioning no bath tub and basic amenities eg no soap in shower despite online description of top quality hotel the balcony was just a dirty piece of concrete i left room service breakfast request outside my door in good time but they forgot to collect it so no breakfast arrived no apology offered atmosphere depressing
