wifi code for my room did not work staff unhelpful it must be because your tablet is english code included room number i eventually connected using a different number glitch in the system room key stopped working twice in four days ordering room service required some persistence as staff dealt with not understanding my accent by hanging up breakfast euros a night which was a bit steep but turned out not to matter as the doorman insisted that i get a ticket to enter the dining room which wasn t mentioned on check in just breakfast is on the floor but wouldn t tell me where to purchase this so i went to a local cafe where no doubt i got a better deal anyway on the whole a rather frustrating stay
