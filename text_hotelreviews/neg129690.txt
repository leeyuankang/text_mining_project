on arrival my friend and i thought that the lady on the reception at that time rushed us and did not explain matters to us very well before we had got really into the reception she was asking for my credit card for the purposes of the mini bar i said that we did not require this but she said that this would be credited to us at the end of our visit i feel that we should have been given the choice and not just told that we had to pay this up front
