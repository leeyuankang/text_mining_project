the receptionist is not really friendly to me every day i saw guests argue with the receptionist over things they just don t seem to be helpful at all the lift was broken the entire time i was there so have to climb floors everyday the room is spacious but not very clean the floor is so thin that you can basically hear everything your neighbors do especially at night the mattress is the worst and you can actually feel the springs inside in won t recommend for a long stay
