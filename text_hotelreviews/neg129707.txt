i have used this hotel on and off since it used to be privately owned and was very nice but a little run down or year ago it was closed for years and totally refurbished it is now getting ready to be done again as the degree of footfall is starting to show door to wardrobe broken dirty tile grout in bathroom table tops scratched and devoid of paint tea coffee not replenished for second night etc this is a nice hotel in a great location with a bit more thought on the part of the management it could be one of the best and best value in that area
