the room was dirty the headboard was peeling and there were some stains on the walls the bath had no plug there was no iron in the room when there was meant to be and the blind in the bathroom was mouldy and disgusting the mattress was absolutely horrendous it was so old and soft that we both had to climb out of it in the morning
