this was supposed to be a star hotel but this was one of my worst experiences ever the room appliances shower etc were totally outdated smelly some things not working the room i was assigned was missing a tv a hanger for the tv was there but the tv was missing i changed then to another room the room had not even place for a chair and was missing basics that even a hostel has as a hook to hang something or a lights switch near bed or a light close to the bed the shared shower had only cold water the tap was falling down and this had nothing to do with me not knowing how to use it rude excuse from the reception internet too slow to check even and email very bad breakfast for a start hotel no real juice very few choices i was offered to pay an extra on top of the extra breakfast cost to get something warm the plugs are old and unlike other international hotels do not fit eu plugs without an uk adapter personal at the reception has bad manners and is not trained avoid this place by all means
