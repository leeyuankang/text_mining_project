hotel was run down and reception was medieval receptionist was slow and they wanted the money for the room when we arrived before we had time to see the room walls were dirty and shower was peeling away at the ceiling headboards were scratched not a wide selection of teas for tea and coffee and room was cold i don t think the room or the stay was worth for one night
