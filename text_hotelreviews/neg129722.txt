when you first walk into the lobby it looks nice and cozy but once you get into the room that s were you get very disappointed the rooms are way over due for renovation the walls have nasty staines and scratches the comfortater looked like it hasn t been washed in ages blanket had red stains on it gross i should have taken pictures to post it here but you ll see for yourself if you happen to stay there shower was all rusty and splashed water all over the place tv remote was broken and tv itself had very poor signal almost impossible to watch but the most disturbing part was the mini bar it had the bottle of sparkling water with broken seal on it refilled with tap water they claim to be the star hotel it s a lie i would barely give them
