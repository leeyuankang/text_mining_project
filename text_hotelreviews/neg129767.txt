i booked this hotel for a few people who were on a business trip and the comments on their return would not make me want to book with that hotel again it was very date drab and not particularly clean the rooms were extremely small and cramped one lady couldn t even open the door all the way because the bed was there one person was told they weren t upgraded to one of the better rooms which was what the lady was in and was taken out of the building and along the road to another building this is not the sort of hotel that i would book for a business trip so consider it was not value for money i would definitely not recommend it the website does not show the hotel in it s true light so is very misleading
