room was a decent double room but with the addition of extra single became very cramped double bed very uncomfortable with springs sticking up extra single bed was missing a proper duvet we had to search cupboards for a blanket so my daughter was warm enough old water stain marks on ceiling above bed spoilt the decor of room which was otherwise ok tea coffee provided in room but only fruit or earl grey tea a breakfast blend would have been more welcome for early morning
