breakfast is delicious but quite expensive as is the cost if you order a coffee while sitting in the lobby i wish they hadn t taken quite such advantage of the convenience for guests of eating in it s beautiful comfortable and food is very good but overpriced nicer to recognize guest loyalty by charging a more fair rate
