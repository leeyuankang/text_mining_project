the rooms weren t nice on the top floor with tiny window that look out into other people s windows and attic like rooms that cut the area space because of the attic like diagonal walls the rooms with an upstairs and downstairs separate couch area were particularly horrific the toilet is downstairs and the sink and shower is upstairs where your bed is they were also dark and not updated i think the lower level floors might be much nicer with big open windows make sure to ask for a room on one level facing the main courtyard and you will probably be ok do not book on floor breakfast is expensive and better elsewhere
