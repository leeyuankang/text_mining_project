the rooms are in need of refurbishment although the bed is very comfortable the overall decor is tired dark and a little unwelcoming we were paying over euros for one night and this seemed really excessive for the quality of accommodation the breakfast in the morning was euros each and was an unedifying buffet of cold croissant cheese and fruit salad i felt really disappointed with the experience as a whole as i felt slightly ripped off
