we were up on the second floor and had a suite with a balcony the room was small for people and we did not like the shower sink area not being separate from the sleeping space toilet area was very small and the sink was outside of the toilet area breakfast buffet was tasty but expected more of a variety of foods for the cost there was a table and chairs but really no space for it in the room
