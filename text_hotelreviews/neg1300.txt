the bed was uncomfortable the bath was not able to be emptied due to a faulty waste system and perhaps most disappointing was the club lounge which only served drinks with no snacks one of the fridges was broken and the coffee machine was temperamental a poor experience compared to the hilton or other equivalent lounges i wouldn t have minded that much but i purposely opted for the more expensive room with lounge access
