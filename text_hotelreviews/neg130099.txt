the staff checked us in to a floor where the air conditioning was broken and the hotel was aware of the ptrblem on check in and still put us on that floor we had to relocate to another floor hours later which could have been avoided the restaurant was closed for a private booking the sky view lounge closed at pm even though staff were there to wait on the bar service for no one to serve
