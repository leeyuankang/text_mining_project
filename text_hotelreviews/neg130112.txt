was disappointed with roof terrace seating area after enquiring of open times we were not informed you had to make a reservation to use the terrace so when we went it was closed with a rope across entrance other bar had no staff there at was open until midnight when we enquired at reception about getting a drink we were told by staff it closed at midnight another guest told us the bar tender would not be happy as was grumpy with them at we pointed out to the receptionist it was so a staff member came to the bar to serve us
