they charged me twice without any notice me in the beginning and fortunately then cancelled the second transaction until i found out that twice the amount was reserved at my account therefore i wasn t able to use my other money and wait for the reservation to be cancelled i asked them in advance to provide me with a room option that had a big single bed and a shower but instead they just gave me a room with a bath tub and twin bed the room needs a renovation and to be more tidy overall i wouldn t recommend anyone to stay at this hotel and use services of chain
