beds to low i booked a double room went to sit on bed and they split apart unlike most hotels who put a single sheet so the bed stays together you could feel the springs as well there was no one to help with luggage to and from taxi which i d expect of a star hotel i prepaid breakfast only i got sick on the first night with a bad cold or flu when i rang reception to see what could be done was advised i d have to pay again for room service if you don t like traffic noise stay elsewhere if i had not been sick i would have gone elsewhere
