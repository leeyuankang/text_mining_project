the only hotel i have ever stayed in where they tried to charge me for extra tea bags i spoke to three members of staff including managers who insisted it was company policy the experience totally spoilt my stay there were four capsules of coffee in the room for the coffee makers but only two tea bags is this prejudice against tea drinkers
