this stay wasn t as good as the last few we had ripped wallpaper in the room above the bed the toilet was leaking badly and had to be repaired the room service was received without covers on top of them which made the food cold there was also a charge on my card after we reached and instead of taking just the little extra that was spent i was charged a full amount twice taking over out of my account which is highly frustrating as i now can t use those funds and have to wait days for it to be released this policy should be stated to you on check in or all members of staff should be aware of this which they weren t and it should be dealt with correctly instead of being charged double the amount
