late checkout was gbp per hour after even though the hotel did not seem fully booked the next day in the shower the water went everywhere so needed all towels to get it dry little space in the closet i was unlucky as there was a fire alarm test just when i was talking on the phone with clients it s faster to stop a taxi in the street than ask the reception to call you one i found it a bit expensive but so are all hotels in central london
