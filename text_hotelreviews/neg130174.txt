at check out they tried to over charge me they said that booking com prices were indicative quotes not an agreed contract price and tried to charge me significantly more when they finally agreed to charge the booking com amount they still got it wrong but only by a small amount they seemed surprised that i asked for this to be refunded and suggested that i should be more flexible with the bill it all took about minutes to sort out i was late for my business meeting as a result after their various explanations about the vague nature of their pricing and charges nothing specific and understandable such as a tourist tax or something i did not trust them enough to leave them to charge an amount to my credit card in my absence which is what they suggested they d do to sort it out i hope it was just poor training but
