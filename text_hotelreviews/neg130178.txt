the receptionists need training or improvement they couldn t find my booking and then said i hadn t paid when i paid earlier on in the day over the phone they then said i booked two rooms when i only booked a double room we went to our room to find two single beds at opposite sides of the room the room thy changed us to was lovely but what an inconvenience at midnight in the morning they thought we didn t have breakfast included and tried to charge me however this was also paid prior to us going to the hotel to add to this i wrote of my resivation notes that the hotel was a surprise for my partner and that the booking was through me only when we went to check in the receptionist said the price of the room out loud so he could hear this made both of us feel very uncomfortable the views priceless and some of the staff are a real credit however the customer service at reception and the price for the rooms are too much
