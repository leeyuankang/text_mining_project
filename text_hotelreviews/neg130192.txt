i had been given a room for a disabled traveller and so the shower was not a my height and difficult to use as there was a stool no kettle in the room and when i called them around when i noticed they said they would come they came upstairs to look and agreed but it never appeared the next morning i asked again and they said they were short of staff in the evenings and couldn t do it now also no printer was working and so no printed vat receipt still no email from them as was promised
