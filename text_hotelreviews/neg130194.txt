we booked a double room with city view the view was great but on booking i had asked if a deluxe room with city view was possible i never received a reply to my enquiry this was a shame as it was for our wedding anniversary so wanted something a little special was happy to pay more too the room we had has a window which wouldn t close even on floor the noise from traffic was disturbing throughout the night which impacted our comfort so the scores reflect this
