although breakfast was incredible there was music playing quite loudly sometimes with sad songs which i could not turn off or move away from it was very intrusive hence i hurried my breakfast just to get out of there which was a shame i really don t see the point of that my advice cut the music quiet breakfast chatter is much more pleasant bear in mind as well that business travellers may well want to be preparing for their day ahead and may not appreciate that sort of disturbance
