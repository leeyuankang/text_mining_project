the staff were polite enough but couple instances where staff were arguing with each other infront of us another where we were queuing for drinks and extra staff members were at the bar and didnt help or even acknowledge us and when asked about a tour bus i was told to go into the centre even though i later found out that there was a stop right outside the hotel
