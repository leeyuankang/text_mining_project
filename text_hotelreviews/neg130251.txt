bookings never seem to be visible from booking com and both stays i ve had here i have had long complicated check ins and had to email the booking confirmation to their reservations team booked an upgraded room this time but had to phone and request the extras from reception as they weren t in the room room service provided a strange selection and although ok the quality of the produce was not great and did not live up to the overall standard of the hotel
