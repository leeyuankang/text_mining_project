on arrival in the room there was no kettle had to go to reception to get a kettle the toilet seat was broken and when i discussed this and asked for a reduction in the bill the hotel was per night the reception staff and duty manager said that a reduction in the bill would not be possible this type of service for a hotel charging per night is frankly appalling and i will not be stopping there again although the location and many other aspects of the place are ok
