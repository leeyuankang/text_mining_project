the staff at the breakfast room isn t really friendly and warm the person who welcomes you at the breafast room is at the wrong place i asked for a quiet room at an higher level the hotel has at least stores and i got a room at the floor on the street no phonique isolation it s the worse hotel i have ever been for the noise i let you check all the i have booked through booking com when you arrive at the room you find a customer survey on your bed but there is no pen in the room to fill it every time the doors room are closed it makes such a nois when you re sleeping it wakes you up
