firstly we had to wait a very long time to get checked in the staff member at the reception then booked us in the wrong room once that was sorted out we got to our room and then notice that the floor was dirty it was full of crumbs by the bed the following day when we checked out an hour late as we overslept which was extra however the same lady at the recpetion tried to charge us extra for a late check out every thing about this hotel was rubbish i would highly suggest you to not stay here
