staff was stubborn and often unhelpful actually the staff embarrassed us as a company they often said they would assist us with special requests and later said they couldn t i understand not everything is possible to do but the fact that they changed the plan without our leaders knowing was frustrating they then pointed blame at us the customer when i gave negative feedback shocking and dissapointing
