the hotel were not clear about the fact they were going to take a preauthorisation from my debit card for the total amount of our stay plus an additional hours before we were due to arrive on checking out i attempted to explain to the female receptionist that i understood why hotels take a preauthorisation however i would ve appreciated a phone call before i arrived where i could have confirmed my booking should they needed to check and given them a credit card from which to take the preauthorisation as opposed to my debit card which is for my current account i couldn t finish what i was trying to say as the receptionist persisted to talk over me rolling her eyes and told me a debit and credit card were the same thing i explained that they weren t and that s why people have credit cards and that in the documentation i received when making the booking it said the hotel may take a preauthorisation from a credit card and that no payment is made until checking out i pointed out how i didn t book with a credit card and therefore by them taking a preauthorisation from my debit card without notifying me meant they effectively blocked a considerable amount of money in my account potentially impacting standing orders and direct debits i have in place she persisted to argue with me that a credit and debit card are the same as well as patronise me telling me that i should ensure i have the necessary funds available to cover my stay in a hotel when i make a booking i said i didn t need help to manage my finances that i wasn t paying for the whole group to stay we were going to pay seperately on check out she continued to shake her head when i spoke sighed and looked away when i tried to speak to her i have never encountered such rudeness before when staying at a hotel
