frankly an appauling room the single bed only just fit in front of the window extremely noisy all night very hot even though it had a fan which i had to leave on all night pillow wasnt particularly comfortable either i can live with a small room as its central london but it wasnt that hot a day so the room must suffer from a problem with the heat hence the fan and the noise from the street is just shocking one of the worst nights i have ever had in a hotel
