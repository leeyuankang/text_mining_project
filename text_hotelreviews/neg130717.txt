it was degrees when we arrived at the hotel and the air conditioning in the room didn t work as this was the reason we booked this hotel we were very disappointed i went to reception twice to ask about it but on both occasions there was nobody there we spent the night very hot and sweaty and didn t get much sleep not what i expect for pounds per night after reading the instruction chart on the room wall it appeared that the system was being over ridden by a central control we were not happy at all
