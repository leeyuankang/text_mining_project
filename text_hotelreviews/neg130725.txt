bed very uncomfortable and the same with the pillows the towels in bathroom are in need of renewal very hard and discolered the breakfast room is downstairs there are no elevators serving any floor of this building we were fortunate to have a room on the first floor anyone with mobility issues like myself will experience difficulty there are no bar facilities on the premises this accommodation in my opinion has been wrongfully classed as a hotel i feel this should have been classed as a guest house
