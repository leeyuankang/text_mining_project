the building facade gave a complete misrepresentation of the property inside three floors with narrow staircase and no lift what staff there were not overly helpful and showed little enthusiasm the breakfast room was minute and basically in the cellar with poor ventilation the kitchen was a small room in the cellar and the smell of the cooking was transposed throughout the building the juice fruit and milk containers we re placed tightly together on top of a cupboard along with coffee warming machine the breakfast was not attractive and everything was swimming in grease the bedroom on the third floor was in need of a good spring clean the nets were filthy the floor sloped from one corner to the opposite wall overall not worthy of stars at the most definitely not star as advertised
