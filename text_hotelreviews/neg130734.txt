very dusty small and cramped single room overpriced by any western standards i understand that people will always book a room in bloomsbury for what appears to be a low price compared with the service but at least try to invest on the atmosphere the name and the photos of the ad are really misleading i can only suggest this place as an extreme emergency situation but i really believe even a youth hostel would be more charming and equipped
