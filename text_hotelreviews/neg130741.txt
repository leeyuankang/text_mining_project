i knew it was to be a small room but i could never ever imagine that the room was to be that small beyond joking it really was about sqm it might have been perfect for a hobbit or a half man but it doesn t seem to be of a proper size for a human i also had to share this room with a spider on the ceiling but anyway it s summer and that poor creature didn t take much space the room has a bed if you re taller than you may find it too small for you a table with tea coffee biscuits a cup a kettle an extremely small space for a shower toilet however there s just no place to drop one s luggage if you have just a laptop with you probably it s not a big problem but if you have a bag with your belongings the only place to put it is on the floor and either you aren t able to open the bathroom or you re not able to open the entrance door if you have a suite you need to keep fresh and ironed over the night there s no chance to do so in this room
