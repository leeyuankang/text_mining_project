do not under any circumstances book the small single room this is room this is literally a store cupboard with a short bed crammed into the corner and a tiny wet cell for a bathroom i m not the tallest person but the bed in this room was far too short even for me i also had to move it away from the wall a little bit as this is an outside wall mostly of the wall is a drafty window actually and as a result absolutely freezing even with the bed nudged away from the wall i still woke up with a raging headache as there was a draft from the window all night and any part of me that was not covered by the duvet was cold and damp this house would also do well with stocking up on wd the door hinges creak squeak and whine rather loudly something that being in room you will not be able to avoid witnessing the room is adjacent to the door leading to the breakfast room and for some reason someone kept going in and out of it until and then again from around onwards it doesn t take a genius to work out how much sleep i actually got with the room also being under the stairs definitely not in a cute way like in harry potter and just opposite the hotel entrance you will hear all the comings and goings no matter how quiet the minority of people try to be if it s not their footsteps or voices waking keeping you up it will be the squeaky doors as for the bathroom i was amazed at the outstanding water pressure of the hand held shower head unfortunately the physical size of the actual shower can t quite cope with the masses of water shooting out of the shower head so you will be flooding the bathroom even if you re conscious of it and try had to avoid it consequently you ll be flooding the bedroom too so make sure to move everything off the little floor space there is around the bed before you attempt to shower
