regarding my particular room it did have an en suite bathroom but it was so small that i could barely turn in the bathroom which didn t bother me but could bother someone more claustrophobic my room was on the first floor at the back with a direct door to the garden awesome so it was relatively quiet however the room is right next to the stairs to the breakfast area so in the morning there was noise and the room smelled of food
