the room is small as expected however there is neither a chair nor a stool to sit on only the bed there is no ventilation in the room but they did provide a fan the fan had a hour time limit i d wake up every two hours or so feeling very warm and then turn the fan on again there is no place to put your items when you unpack there are ample electrical connections but they are hard to access make sure to bring the bulky plug converters that are needed to use us plugs in the british receptacles
