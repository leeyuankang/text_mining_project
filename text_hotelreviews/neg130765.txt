just one little point breakfast time from monday till saturday was till and on sunday till only coming for the weekend trip to london it was a little bit too short till or till i expected breakfast time at least till and didn t notice that info though there was a notice of that in the room and on saturday we were late at and just had a short time to get cornflakes even the tea was not available and when i have asked a lady to give me black tea bags she told me it is not possible too late after i insisted she with a very unfriendly face opened a cupboard and gave me tea bags that was my only negative comment about that hotel all the rest was great and a very good value for money
