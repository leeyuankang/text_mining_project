breakfast was okay and breakfast service was poor too short staffed and not polite we had no welcome when we arrived we had to wait on the stair well for minutes with other people to be seated as there were not enough tables to cater for the amount of people just minutes before breakfast was over at pm which we felt was a little early for the weekend not a word was spoken to us by the waitresses apart from when we were seated english breakfast and scrambled egg or fried manners and politeness cost nothing
