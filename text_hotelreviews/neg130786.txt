i stayed at the property before and room on floor was ok on this occasion i got a small room on ground floor the room needs updating paint marks on walls and door frames worn flooring broken step to toilet drafty window it was incredibly noise as you could hear everyone talking as they entered the hotel every step on main stairs resonates in the room pity the back garden door with access from this room is a mess with brambles and broken chair this could be a beautiful feature
