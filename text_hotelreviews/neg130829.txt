my blind in my room didn t work and my window did not shut there was a safety window in front so it wasn t cold but it was very noisy i understand it was central so a busy road but if the window shut i m sure it would have been quieter also they say there is a place to leave luggage after check out if your not leaving until later it s just next to the reception desk no private room and no luggage tickets you just leave it there under your own will which is not stated i paid and left it safely at kings cross
