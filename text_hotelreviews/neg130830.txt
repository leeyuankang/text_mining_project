i had a single room which was the smallest hotel room i have ever stayed in it was ridiculous thankfully only needed it until there wasn t anything to hang clothes on apart from the door handle no wardrobe there wasn t any room to put my case apart from on the floor next to the bed which meant jumping over it to get to either the door or bathroom only one step would mean you were at both there was some form of sealed external door behind the bed which presumably used to go outside which meant there was a draft at the head of the bed this meant changing and sleeping at the other end of the bed the bathroom layout which meant if you were unfortunate enough to have to sit on the toilet you would also have to watch out for hitting your head on the sink the hotel itself seemed fine the single room unfortunately itself was the size of a cupboard and i definitely wouldn t recommend
