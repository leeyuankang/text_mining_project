we waited a good mins at reception with no one there despite ringing the bell times my room was a cabin i could touch the walls with my arms outstretched i m just under foot tall my feet were hanging off the bottom of the bed my head almost touched the shower head the view outside was of some old sofas and an aluminium ladder dumped outside it was right next to the extractor fans so i was woken by those starting at and then everyone having to walk past my door to get downstairs to the breakfast room i know the rate is only night but these days that can get you a decent premier inn not impressed
