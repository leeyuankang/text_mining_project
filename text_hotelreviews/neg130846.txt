room was in a poor state of repair i chose the normal single room and it was tiny so the small single room must be microscopic most hotels of this price range give a bottle of water not here window was broken meaning it was cold and road noise was terrible blind was also broken meaning morning light streamed in and it looked like it could fall down at any minute breakfast may have been good but the breakfast room was so small that on both occasions i went down it was packed and getting a seat looked to be a good minute wait short time frame for serving breakfast too meant even going down at the start of service was tight for getting to my work
