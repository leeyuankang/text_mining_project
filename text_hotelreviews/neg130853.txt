multiple issues two examples the lock on the door did not work so i had to push the bed up against the door in the night whilst i slept on it to make sure no one came in on the saturday afternoon i was there i came back in the middle of the day to be told i was not allowed in my room because members of staff were moving large pieces of furniture through my room out into the garden my room had a door into the garden without gaining permission asking me if it was ok or even telling me this was going to happen when i asked if they could stop and carry out the moving of the furniture on sunday morning after i had vacated the room because i was in a rush they refused and said they would only be a few more minutes another minutes past they left my room full of dirty foot prints on the floor and had moved many of my personal items to get out of the other door
