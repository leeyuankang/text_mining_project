first of all it is not a hotel of more than people in a room why i was travelling with my family mum and dad and we took the family room my bed was a sofa bed half broken and a very thin mattres on it which its not even suitable for camping when we told the receptionist she told us do not worry you just sleep and you will go out and also when i need it cups for coffee she said this is not my job and she gave us like by force also note that this hotel does not have elevator sobif you have heavy laguages it will be difficult for you to get up the stairs our room was downstairs so we could listen screaming and footsteps all the time walking i do not recommend it sorry
