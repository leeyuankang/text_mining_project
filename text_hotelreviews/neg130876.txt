the breakfast was awful the service was slow and uncommunicative the full english breakfast was appalling and worst i have ever had it consisted of cold toast put down before breakfast order without plates or cutlery etc over done egg grey mass which i can only assume were mushrooms one piece of bacon which was fatty baked beans a tomato and a sausage which was surprisingly nice the other breakfast products yoghurt cheese milk cereal etc provided were set out on the side under light and were not chilled the staff were distant and unwelcoming at times our room was entered just after popped out after we first arrived which made us feel uneasy the shower was extremely small the en suite door handle broken the fan was full with dust and the shower products provided were that of rose and lavender
