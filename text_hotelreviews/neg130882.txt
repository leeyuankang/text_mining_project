only one thing if you book a small single room assure you do not get the one next to the breakfast room it is a converted corridor and there is no room for your suitcase unless you put it on your bed but i am used to small rooms so i could live with that however since it is a converted corridor it has giant windows that leak cold air the space heaters could not keep up with the cold air plus the cold air rushed in just a bed level so it would nearly be impossible to ever sleep w o freezing my stay was in january the staff nodded knowingly and w o issue moved me to a different room
