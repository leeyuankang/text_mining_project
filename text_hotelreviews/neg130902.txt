my small single was not as described and paid for it was a cold blocked off back passage with locked half covered external back door with no key or bolt i was afraid someone could unlock the door from the outside the bed was a child s bed with no headboard jammed up against the door there was a small side table no chair desk wardrobe luggage rack iron board hairdryer in fact at i could touch both sides of the room simultaneously and only just fitted in the bed luckily i only had a small cabin sized wheelie case and handbag because it would not have been possible to bring a large case in to the room thank goodness i was slim enough to slip in to the tiny ensuite also unfortunately the room was in need of repair and redecoration too the male receptionist was quite unsympathetic and had no idea why i was not happy with the room the hotel was full so i could not be allocated another room room booked weeks prior at at night he suggested i could go and try and find another hotel he didn t offer to help me and of course i would have had to pay for this corridor overall terrible experience never to be repeated you have been warned
