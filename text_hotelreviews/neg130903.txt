we were put in a ground floor room this was very strange no windoes apart from an old wooden door with paint chipped off it which opened into a tiny concreted area full of leaves the bed wasn t the comfiest very hard although the bedroom area was nice enough the other part of the room which was up some stairs and you had to duck under an arch to get to it i am quite tall and this could pose some problems if nipping to the toilet in the night there was dust on the dressing table area like it hadn t been cleaned in a while the breakfast wasn t what i would call a full english with one rasher of bacon and one sausage some scrambled egg and beans and a fried tomato we were starting for nights however we didn t get up for breakfast on the second morning it is only served until also which i found a little early if you ask me
