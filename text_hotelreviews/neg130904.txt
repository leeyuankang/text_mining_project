room was tiny ridiculously small for a twin on the front by noisy road this was unacceptable thus we were given the basement room a little larger but still on roadside the stairs were creeky and adjacent door slamming was inappropriate also linen delivery was thrown from the street to outside our room window below early morning giving a heavy body thud noise this was not pleasant we shouldn t have to wear ear plugs in hotels
