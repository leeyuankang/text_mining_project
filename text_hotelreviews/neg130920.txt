there are tiny rooms there are train compartments and there are bloomsbury palace rooms there was a recess for the bed with a cm space on the side it was my first visit to london so i don t know this is perhaps local standards but i have never been anywhere close to a hotel room this small it was ok since i this time only needed a bed but the room description says there would be a writing desk which there wasn t it couldn t possibly have fitted in there wasn t even room to tuck away your luggage you had to place it on the floor thereby blocking either the entrance door or the door to the bathroom my computer which i had to use in bed had to be stored under the bed i estimate the total floor area to less than square metres making up a narrow corridor from the door to the bed accurate information about exactly how small the rooms are would be honest to give customers the chance to make an informed decision the cleaning under the bed and other hard to reach areas was so so i guess it s hard for the cleaners to vacuum such a small room where there s barely any space to move around your equipment the curtains were torn and had black fringes sheets and bathroom were clean though i never tried breakfast since there was a long queue of people waiting to be seated and no tables available there were several nice coffeshops in the neighbourhood however so i didn t go hungry
