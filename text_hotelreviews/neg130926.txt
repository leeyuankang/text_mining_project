as we were travelling as a family of our bedroom was ok but very small very small breakfast room and had to wait for an available table so you could end up waiting in line there was a bedroom next door in the basement that could have been used to extend the breakfast room there is no hotel bar only a sofa in reception if you wanted to relax outside of your room
