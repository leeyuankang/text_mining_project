i was in a bottom floor single room and it was more like old and run down back utility room which had a door and a full room length large widow to the back also there was no headboard well unless you include the back door as one as a result this room was freezing i can t understate how bad his room was and can t believe that they are using it as a room i only stayed approx hours as it was so uncortable and cold they had no other rooms available but did allow me to checkout without any charge found another hotel around the corner
