i was aware the single bedroom would be small but not as tiny as it was this i could have been happy with but for half the price it was certainly not value for money and the bed proved very uncomfortable as well with springs poking into me the room was clean and the location is fantastic but i would think twice booking this hotel given the broom cupboard size of the room
