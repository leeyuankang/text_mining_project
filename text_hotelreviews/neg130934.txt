i got a really small room like s closet when i asked for another room i got one that was underground it was bigger but between the kitchen and the tiny restaurant this was super noisy and it smelled like a kitchen in the morning i had to wait in order to find a table for my breakfast and generally there was no space for anyone the breakfast was of low quality and it was served until i had to do check out at the only positive thing was the location i wouldn t recommend it to other visitors
