the website clearly states a double room has a double bed what we got was two singles pushed together with two single duvets whenever we rolled towards the middle the beds separated i consider this a misrepresentation as i would not have booked this hotel had i known the truth we asked very nicely at reception to change rooms after the first night to be told we couldn t i had to ask by email their complaints procedure to have our room changed which they clearly weren t happy about and i still feel the website should be changed and i m unimpressed i didn t receive what was promised on night one
