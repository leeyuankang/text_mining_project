the small room was infinitesimally small prisoners in solitary confinement have better accommodation smelly just above kitchen noisy straight on front of front door onto street and traffic passes to lower ground floor and breakfast room and noise from rooms above it appeared to be little more than a cupboard the ensuite was even smaller try sitting on the look with the minute sink on your boob and trying to wash in the sink was dreadful when i complained i was fobbed off and felt forced to spend the night because without a refund i couldn t go elsewhere it was my worst nights sleep ever and breakfast was as bland as the room
