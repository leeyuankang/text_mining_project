hotel overall was fine unfortunately our room was awful it was tiny nothing like any of photographs noisy due to been on street level so constant traffic noise dark and dingy with no space the bed was pushed up against window with a table next to it which you had to climb over to get into bed the tv was on the wall at the left side of the bed so impossible to watch clearly a failed attempt at adding another room
