this must be the worst hotel i have ever stayed in london i have stayed in a lot and i am at a loss why it is rated how it is our room and particularly en suite was very dirty and grimy in addition the smell of grease and fried food permeates through the whole hotel every morning leaving your clothes in need of a dry clean we couldn t even open our window due to the smell coming up from the basement kitchen don t let the photos on this website fool you as i did
