as a single female traveller i felt unsafe as door had no working lock the single room was also extra tiny overall place is shabby and most certainly not stars i felt seriously misled by star rating i did not stay in the end as thankfully found friend to stay with instead after seeing how dreadful this place truely is don t be tempted by the price whatever money you spend here is too much please read the reviews on tripadvisor do not book here
