the cooked breakfast took minutes and still didn t arrive so i had to leave for work with a slice of dry dead toast and some plastic wrapped cheese the staff in the tiny kitchen doesn t speak english the tiny dining room catered for about twenty people at the same time the room was in the cellar supposedly for three persons with just a skylight and airless the reception is only manned part of the time and you never see a manager this hotel is overpriced and i felt seriously ripped off i will not use this hotel again
