the room seemed to be much smaller then how they appeared on booking com also other guests had the same feeling although the pictures are accurate just a little deceiving the bed was small we just fitted in their with the two of us there was no a c just a little fan that made more noise then actually moving air the window and curtains were dirty we could not control the room temperature the bathroom was ok small but clean
