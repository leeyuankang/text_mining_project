the curtain in the room and shower head were very dirty and the room was very hot with no aircon the room was smaller than expected but we managed to cram everything in the walking space the shower handle that was mounted to the wall was loose and quite dangerous but was fixed quickly by staff a few extra touches and this hotel could be a lot nicer
