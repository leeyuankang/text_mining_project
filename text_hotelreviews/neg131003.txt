the starts must be some mistake this is not more than a stars hotel no continental breakfast offered as written in the description asked for it answer was no breakfast room is quite small and gets uncomfortable when busy no mini bar in the room hotel is located on a pretty busy street and was very noisy also during late night and early morning hours room was very tiny sink is way too close to the toilette for a larger person this will be an issue windows and curtains in the room were very dirty also the carpet in the corridor was not exactly clean there is more one can wish from a cleanliness point of view so don t be misled by the palace word in the name there s nothing palace about it
