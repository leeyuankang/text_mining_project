small rooms even at basements you can get rooms ac was not working rooms were suffocating requested staff to arrange different room or to fix ac they give you table fans as ac nothing was done had to stay in ground floor suffocating room beside kitchen whose smell woke us up every morning breakfast is served in small congested room where i could not secure place in time and had to skip it in lack of time i would never recommend anyone this hotel unless you can confirm with hotel prior to payment that you wont get basement rooms
