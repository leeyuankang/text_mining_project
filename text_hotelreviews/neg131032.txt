the hotel was dirty the rooms were stifling hot and the fan didn t work the carpets didn t fit the floor meaning dirty floorboards were showing there weren t enough seats in the breakfast room for the number of guests meaning guests had to queue for breakfast waitresses didn t speak very good english and could not understand basic requests for salt or sweetener i would not recommend this hotel at all
