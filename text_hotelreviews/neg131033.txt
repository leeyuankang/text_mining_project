terrible management and service let me list the ways a c was advertised as part of he room but actually broken during or entire stay the staff promised it would be fixed the next day but never was we were given two fans that did not cool our room right next to the kitchen downstairs we asked to move rooms but the staff promised they would look into it but never followed through they took our large bath towels one day and replaced them with hand towels because they did not get their laundry delivery our ironing board had a burned cover basically we should have gotten a discount or even a full refund for this awful experience
