have booked the hotel for pax a few months before checking in and put in a request for air conditioning summer and ground floor room else need an elevetor we had luggages instead we were given a room in basement two with miserable fans because we were late in our check in not acceptable as the booking was made much earlier and request was also put in then the room should have been reserved if not ground floor maybe in basement one the staff should have tried to accommodate our request and not give the reason as the hotel was full and we were late in checking in worse still we stayed here for nights and on the second night they removed a fan from our room we insisted that they replaced the missing fan as the room was very stuffy with no windows overall stay was not good
