the bed was tiny for two people i woke up numb down one side from awkward sleeping pattern my partner was in constant fear she would fall out of bed we had to roll up a hand towel and stick in under the edge of her side of the mattress to create a safety ledge naturally this was removed after the night by cleaning staff and then we were short changed the hand towel as well grrrrr this bed is for one person only its the smallest double bed in human history i felt tortured having to sleep in it never staying there again
