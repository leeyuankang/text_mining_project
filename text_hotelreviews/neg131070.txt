there were only a few negatives from our stay which included the occupiers of neighbouring rooms were not very considerate continually slamming doors and talking loudly in the small corridor outside our room the decor in the room was a little on the tired side with a window catch missing a very hot few days in london and the air conditioning not working in the room meant the windows had to be left open so the smell of breakfast cooking each morning was very strong
