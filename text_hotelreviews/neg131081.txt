my room was really cramped and it was really difficult to open a large suitcase in it no wardrobe just a tiny little shelf no air conditioning rather boring and limited breakfast menu either english breakfast or yoghurt no salads and the dining room gets really stuffy when filled with guests poor wifi connection
