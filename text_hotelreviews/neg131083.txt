waited at reception mins for someone to return to the desk so i could check in small single room was incredibly tiny like a shoe box asked to upgrade but nothing bigger available bed wasn t even a full size single no headboard on quite free wheels so slid around the floor a bit and crammed really close to the wall window sill barely any floor space or room to hang store anything had to hang clothes above the tea station shower room very very small barely a cloakroom tiny shower not even full sized and a tiny cloakroom sized sink right next to the toilet generally the room was finished to a very poor standard plaster chipping around the edges bare filler visible and needed a good lick of paint laminate floor had suffered water damage hardly surprising in view of the proximity of the shower to the door into the bedroom basically felt like a corridor cupboard that they ve tried to monetise and done a poor job of it if it had been finished to a better standard the size would have been easier to excuse all in all not what i expected from a genius recommendation i thought they were supposed to be great deals to reward loyal booking com customers not a punishment
