this was probably the most pathetic excuse of a hotel room that i have ever stayed in and i have stayed in some dingy places before the room was the converted former exit to the back yard and the hard floor showed obvious signs of water damage to top it off the bed was tiny only cm long about i m not tall but even so my feet were sticking out past the bed clatter from kitchen and a noise from some electrical motor nearby made it impossible to sleep past seven in the morning if they put you in the tiny room half a set of stairs down from the entrance just say no the other rooms in the hotel might be ok but this room was just horrible
