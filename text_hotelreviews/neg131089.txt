we were positioned in lower ground where people could see through the window should the curtains be open and we were lying in bed not a big problem but the main air con wasn t working and it seemed we had a standing air con unit next to the bed this air con unit generated more heat from the side than the cool air it could produce making the room a sauna we could open the window but have to keep the thick curtains closed for any sort or privacy meaning no cold air would pass through we were up several times in the night for cold showers sleepless night
