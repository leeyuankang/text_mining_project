the room was so small i couldn t even put my clithes on properly it was part of the landing that got sectioned off and made into a room this was not fairly reflected in the booking process and the price was xomparable to other places i have stayed in where the room size was much better breakfast was served in the basement with very little ventilation which made the breakfast hall unbearable to sit in no wi fi in rooms either which is atrocious
