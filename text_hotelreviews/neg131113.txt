my room was hardly bigger than a shoebox for gbp night my feet were hanging off the bed and im not particularly tall cm my room was made out of the way towards the backyard hence the shoebox had doors my room was above the kitchen so i woke up for the smell of eggs and fried bacon i did not like it at all you get much more for value if u add pounds and get a different place
