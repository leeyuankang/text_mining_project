i was first put in basement room which felt like a dungeon i expected a small room but not to be in subterranean level receptionist was nice and moved me to first floor i had no problems that room was even smaller than the first but there is no double glazing and the noise from the street was continuous i may as well had the bed on the pavement i could not sleep all night i would not recommend him at all
