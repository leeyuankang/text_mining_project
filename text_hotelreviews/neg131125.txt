we were in a small but clean room on the top floor there is no lift and therefore had to carry our case s up several flights of stairs the room was very hot and already had a fan tall on a stand and the air conditioning might as well have been non existent the weather outside was warm and obviously heat rises so it was like a sauna and very uncomfortable to sleep in if at all our complaints were met with a smile and the engineer will be here tomorrow i actually met him and he said the air con was working but said to me what do you expect in the summer i reminded him it was early may and the whole point of air con was to regulate the temperature to an ambient one the room cooled a little as the outside temperature got lower but not good
