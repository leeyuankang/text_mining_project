the inexpensive single room is on the top floor a long walk with a suitcase it s very small but was okay but the position of the safe made it hard to see almost on the floor and inconvenient to use is there an outlet in the room itself i only saw and used the one in the bathroom but it was great that it took american plugs directly i came with an adapter but didn t need it wish there had been a second set of pegs and more hangars for clothes since there s no closet but the arrangement in general is really efficient only other thing a folding chair could hang on a wall peg and be used as needed
