we had an unpleasant experience when getting breakfast i was traveling with my year old mother we arrived just at the end of the breakfast hour and although the buffet was still out were told we had to leave which seemed ridiculous as people were still eating and food was there in front of us my mother is very unsteady on her feet and the restaurant manager was totally rude and inconsiderate i complained to management and i believe he was reprimanded they told me that they might offer us a free breakfast the next day but they charged us the manager had changed his attitude though the elevator is tiny and not for the claustrophobic
