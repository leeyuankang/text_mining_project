the single bedroom was so small and there were barely any space to put the luggage i had to put my luggage against the door to create more space in the room it felt like there were lack of design plan for storage space had been put into the room since putting the luggage against the door would be considered a safety hazard but it had to be done to be able to open the bathroom door the wall desperately needs to be fixed and the curtain needs a little bit of vacuum done also i rarely saw any staff on the front desk which is kind of frustating when you need their immediate assistance
