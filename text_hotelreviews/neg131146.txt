the entrance smelt of smoke the reception was unmanned rundown messy and dirty reception staff seemed like they had better things to do than speak to me the walls and windows were rundown and a bit grubby net curtains were grubby bathroom door was grubby house keeping was so poor that the previous guest had left some shoes in the bottom of the wardrobe and house keeping hadn t seen them no ironing facilities or hairdryer in room had to ask for them and this seemed to be an inconvenience to them the outside of the hotel was dirty and rundown bathroom was tiny like by if that if i had been staying more than one night or had been there for anything more than work i d have checked out before i checked in first impressions count for a lot and my first and last were as bad as each other
