the room was very hot when i arrived the sash window and the inner sash were both stuck open so the air conditioning was ineffective the inside of the windows and the frames were absolutely filthy resulting in black handmarks on the walls where other people had obviously tried to move the windows i asked the receptionist to arrange for the window to be closed only to be told it already was i assured her it wasn t and someone did come and close it while i was out however they did not manage to close the inner sash so as a result it was very noisy with traffic and sirens throughout the night made for a poor nights sleep
