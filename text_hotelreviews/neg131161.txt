had issues with the checking in took over an hour to resolve with bloomsbury denying my reservation despite me having email proof from booking com and then asking to just purchase another room to deal with it in the morning as this was getting very late into the night with work the next morning seemed very reserved to assist and then booking com finally answered the phone to refuse any form of compensation booking com blaming the bloomsbury palace and the bloomsbury palace blaming booking com overall did not feel like a guest in the hotel and more a nuisance
