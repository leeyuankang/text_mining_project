it could definitely be more clean i couldn t say that it was dirty but i stayed for four nights and the sheets were not changed not even once there was an issue with the sink it was draining extremely slowly and as a result it was getting dirty very fast i have noticed that it wasn t cleaned either even if my room was made up the breakfast was offered for a very short time so all the clients of the hotel were trying to get served on the same time the waitresses were doing their best but under such pressure of work and pressure of time their work was not easy at all longer breakfast hours could make life easier both for the customers and the workers the room was extremely small not the smallest i have stayed to in london though and extremely hot the bed was ok but the furniture and deco was definitely tired and the walls too as you could see huge cracks from the top to the bottom
