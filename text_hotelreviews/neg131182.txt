i really can t believe this hotel is classified as stars a part from the price rooms are so small that you can t open your luggage no wardrobe and you don t have enough air for breathing new windows have been placed over the old ones and in order to open them you have to jump on the bed when i tried to open it to have more air it suddenly fell down and i could have seriously hurt my hands and fingers it was really dangerous
