service was terrible we asked if we could have a drink in the restaurant which was empty and we were told only if we were eating there was no other place to have a drink we also asked a number of question at reception and were told someone would come back to us which they didn t and finally we were disturbed by other guests who we think had escorts to the hotel and proceeded to keep up the whole hotel with their activities we were on the floor friends on and other guest we talked to from floor and everyone was disturbed also by the subsequent arguement and intervention of another guest several people were complaining at reception however no discount on the room not even a complimentary breakfast was offered the guy in reception was laughing about it
