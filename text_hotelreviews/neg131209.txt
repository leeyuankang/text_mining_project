i definitely would not recommend staying here we arrived in the morning to leave our suitcases and couldn t check in yet which was fine however there was no secure space available to leave our luggage it was just left next to the reception desk all day when we came back later to check in we were given room on the ground floor it was the worst room i have ever seen the room was right next to the hotel entrance so noise was definitely a problem the room was tiny you could only access the bed from one side and the tv was to the right of the bed so it would have been impossible to watch the window opened on to the side walk of gower street which has a lot of traffic at all times of day so noise was definitely a problem from that side as well there was a horrible smell in the room it smelled like the bathroom hadn t been cleaned in months we went to the reception to ask for a different room because the one we were given was not inhabitable but all they could offer us was some febreeze to mask the smell we ended up having to find another hotel at in the evening the night before a big work meeting
