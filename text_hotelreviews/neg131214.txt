the service at breakfast was diabolical i was not greeted at all despite several waitresses wondering rudely past me there was no glass on my table so had to wait until more were brought into the room i stood waiting as there was no coffee either and half of the cutlery was missing i stared at a waitress who finally asked if i wanted anything my breakfast came fairly quickly but toast was delayed then there was no butter left and when the waitress spent several minutes wondering in and out and my toast getting cold came with a pot of margerine and told me the butter was frozen not good service at all and let the hotel down completely
