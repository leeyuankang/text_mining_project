we booked a double bed room which was very small and compact the room temperature was boiling hot without having heating on and nothing to cool it down but there was a portable fan and we couldn t use it went for breakfast just before the closing time and there were so many people in the room having breakfast but there were no staff and i noticed couple of staff in the kitchen who were busy checking time on their wrist watch they both saw me standing but didn t bothered yo come out so i went back to my room and tried to make cuppa tea but there was no tea spoon anywhere o dear we just checked out and went to the cafe nearby and had breakfast
