wasn t the cleanest hotel but was perfectly adequate receptionist when we checked in was lovely but rest of staff were not quite so welcoming again not a problem if you just want to come and go only real issue was the luggage storage not very secure and worried that somebody may take a liking to our cases more was fine though all in all a good stay and would definitely stay again
