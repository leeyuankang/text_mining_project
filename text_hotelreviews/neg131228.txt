only reserve the room designated as small if it is for a child or if you are really desperate there is really very little space and almost none to put clothes let alone to store luggage very little lounge space area in the building for someone to use in order to avoid staying in the room in my case working inside the room is completely impractical unless you decide to use the bed the basement restaurant area is uncomfortably small and it felt totally cramped at least whenever i tried to use it there was a waiting line for breakfast which was mediocre
