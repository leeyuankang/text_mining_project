triple room in the underground floor very dark looking like a dungeon the pictures on booking com shows very different above the ground room due to walls ceiling curvature it was not possible to place mirror on normal height so shaving required bending me back during the day of our stay there was no hot water boiler malfunction and the staff started action to fix it only after my call there was no heating december either and the personnel was very well aware of the issue they were using electric heater at the reception desk but they started acting on the issue only when i directly asked them to do so there were no additional blankets in the whole hotel i don t even mention lack of blankets in the room as there was no cabinet in the room to store them or your belongings there is air conditioning mentioned on booking com in my room i was only able to find old fan it was cold so no big issue for me it looks like the universal recipe for a hotel in london take some old place invest in it once then run it for years without any repairs and call for serious amount of money the word palace in hotel s name is just a sad joke
