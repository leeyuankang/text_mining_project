from what i could tell my room was actually a converted entrance hall with a single bed in it i m used to having small rooms in london but this really was ridiculous the bed was so small that my feet were hanging out of the bottom i m and it was situated alongside a drafty window so i had a draft on my face all night at the top of the bed was where i assume the back door used to be so more drafts came through here
