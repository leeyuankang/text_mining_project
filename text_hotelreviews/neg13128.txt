we stayed in a superior double which was a lovely room but the wet room did not contain the shower water the water went everywhere except for down the drain and flooded onto the carpet in our room resulting in a very rushed shower we got moved to a suite for the following night because of this issue then found that the suite had exactly the same issue carpet drenched tiling needs to be more angled to allow the water to filter to the drain hole
