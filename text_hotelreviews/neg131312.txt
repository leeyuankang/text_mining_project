this is the right hotel for you if you are prepared to have neither a chair nor a table in your room have no hanger for your towels use a breakfast room with an open kitchen that makes you smell like sausage and bacon for hours have a metal grilled window if you stay in a lower ground room with no escape should there be a fire in the hallway of stairway not be able to open a window not have ventilation in the windowless bathroom not have anyone guard your baggage after check out they just tell you to leave it next to the reception desk without any need to identify yourself when you come to pick it up later carry your baggage to the third floor no elevator there was no tv remote control in my room and the safe didn t work fire doors were always left open even though a sign told you to keep them shut my advice look for another hotel
