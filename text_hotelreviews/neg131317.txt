staff on arrival completely unhelpful my room and bed were extremely small and poorly located on the ground floor with smells from the kitchen and noise from inside and out i enquired about upgrading i was willing to pay the extra but despite having other rooms available i checked online they would not allow me to change rooms very poor customer service and a strange attitude if they d allowed me to upgrade they would have received more income and would have had a satisfied customer
