first room we viewed was lower ground level right by air conditioning unit for the building very noisy second room we viewed and then stayed in was narrow but comfortable however cleanliness was very questionable it was a long time since the surfaces had been dusted the two towels we were provided with were hand towels not sufficient for a grown person to use after showering staff were accommodating with our requests needs but certainly could have been more pleasant about it
