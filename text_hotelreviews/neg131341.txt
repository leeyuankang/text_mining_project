the rooms were not at all what was shown in the pictures they were extremely small i booked six months in advance and i was placed in the basement there was no air conditioning and since i was in the basement ground window we couldn t open the windows for air there was a humidifier in the room that didn t work properly and was not vented out of the room properly when asked to switch rooms i was told that the room i was in was their only double bed room find that very hard to believe on my last day a staff member male opened the door on me while i was changing without knocking when i looked up reviews on google i saw a woman post that the same thing happened to her staff was rude breakfast room was small and overcrowded i would never stay here again not to mention the bed was broken and extremely uncomfortable
