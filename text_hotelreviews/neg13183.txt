stayed in the blue quite and wifi and tv didn t work to be fair i did not mention this to management as most of the time we were out and about lift is small normal people a very large person would likely not fit nor would large luggage with a person leaving stairs as the only option shower bath was oddly missing any side glass sheets to stop splashing water hitting the floor and it lacked a holder for the shower head which made showering fun i guess they assumed everyone would take a bath instead none of these were major issues to me hence still giving a very good rating because everything else was fantastic
