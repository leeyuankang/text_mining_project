well if you re on a sightseeing holiday it is vital that you plan your next day feom your hotel room now this was something we couldn t do neither our neighbors from different floors the wifi was absolutely rubbish many people complained including me throughout the days we spent there but hey reception restarted yhe rooter every time what did not solve the problem promising tje next day it shall be fixed since he s going to pass on our rightful complaint you see we paid for a room with wifi well they didn t manage to fix the problem hence the full house really disappointed could have found a better place for that money the other little problem was that after room service always left with one set of gel and shampoo every day and i ve asked every day for another set one day we only had shampoos not really thoughtful overall cleanliness was good tough
