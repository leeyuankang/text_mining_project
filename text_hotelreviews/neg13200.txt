this hotel markets itself as a star and charges four star prices i suspect the french don t use the same standards as everywhere else in the world as this hotel is at best three star there was barely enough room for the bed in the room the wifi connection process was prehistoric with a series of codes for each device that kept cutting out we had to run the shower for minutes each time before the water was hot staff didn t replace the shampoos unless we asked them this is a seriously over priced hotel and was definitely not worth the money
