i didn t ask for the breakfast since it was expensive euro per person but i could buy food from the supermarkets the hotel assigned me a very small room at the beginning very hot and without ventilation but after the first days i asked to change it and they gave me a better room i booked the taxi from the hotel to the airport and the driver seemed to know the manager of the staff and i was surprised that for min driving he charged euro when i took the taxi from the airport to the hotel i paid euro for the same trip don t book a taxi with the hotel
