staff prices facilities we were overcharged by booking com but the hotel would not make any adjustments they say it is booking com s fault but booking com say it is the hotel who give them the rates our room was for persons but all facilities were for cups glasses coffee tea etc if a question was raised with the staff an answer was never received despite promises to get an answer no courtesy in this hotel treated like a second rate citizen no parking despite booking it so had to stay in a multi story a short drive away my advice find another hotel there are plenty to choose from
