internet did not work at all the entire stay could not control heat either too cold or too hot the rooms are noisy there s no standing shower just a hand spray in the bath breakfast is a rip off especially with all the restaurants nearby the rooms are super tiny don t be fooled by the wide angle lense used to take the picture very few tv channels this is more like a bed breakfast expect a bed in a good location and no other amenities
