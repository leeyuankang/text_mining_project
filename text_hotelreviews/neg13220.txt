our room was called a junior suite but was basically a bedroom with a second single bed stuffed in a niche right next to the large bed fine for my mother daughter and i but lacking in privacy one might expect with a suite the public areas of the hotel seemed a bit worn while the location was central and convenient it lacked in charm though very close to the marias which is full of charm
