the location can also be busy so if you want a super quiet place don t stay here having said that the double glazing and sound proofing is excellent so after having a few drinks and enjoying the local surroundings you can go home in a few mins and not hear much at all shower was small and not the best water pressure not a huge deal for me but may be for some
