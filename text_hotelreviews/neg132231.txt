the continental breakfast was very good but not included in the room price and too expensive to indulge in every day fortunately there was a mini fridge in the room and i could store items purchased from the nearby grocery store for breakfast on subsequent mornings unfortunately there is only one sink in the bathroom but couples can take heart in that there are large shelves next to it
