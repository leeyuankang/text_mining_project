this hotel does not have the room sizes facilities or services you expect from a star establishment even in paris at best this is an average star hotel it is totally over priced as a result the corridors are narrow and continuously crowded with hotel maids dirty laundry and cleaning equipment the room food service is sourced externally and therefore takes ages to be delivered the beds are hollow and the pillows too hard resulting in back and neck aches the wifi login is cumbersome and cuts off periodically at this price the breakfast which is served in a basement room should be free in paris it is cheaper anyway to go to a nearby street caf
