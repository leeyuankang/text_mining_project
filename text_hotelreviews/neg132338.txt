room size and bathroom size was just unbelievably small standard room but still you literally fall into the bed on entering the room i travel regularly to paris and have stayed at many other hotels in excellent locations but clearly for a better value for money also if hairdryers in modern hotels still are these weird and old white fixed thing in the wall i get angry the whole room and equipment to me seems not designed from a user friendliness perspective a pity
