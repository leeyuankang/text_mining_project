initial reception was a little terse and not super welcoming shower water wasn t contained well within tub one of those european style tubs with a glass half door that didn t seal very well so the floor would flood i am sure there is some smarter way to use it sink backed up a bit but wasn t worth complaining about ac took a while to cool when turned on typical small european room with limited space for suitcases storage overall nice place though and location was excellent would stay again for a somewhat more reasonable rate
