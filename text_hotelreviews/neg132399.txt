what makes the hotels location interesting lively and buzzing unfortunately also makes it not nice it s located metres from the moulin rouge and a whole street of sex shops where we were propositioned to enter sex clubs and were offered drugs by dubious looking characters this area is easy to avoid but the overspill from that area does get to the hotel area breakfast is pp not worth this price
