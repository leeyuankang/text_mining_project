there was no place to put toiletries in the bathroom and the desk inside the room was too tiny other than that room size was ok and there was good light the staff was nice just enough but not friendly except girls in reception when you stay at a neighbourhood like pigalle i guess the interaction i am looking for is friendly not polite there wasn t anything happening in the hotel regarding music as well if you are looking for that music art something creative you won t find it here i can say overall the hotel is convenient but nothing special location is good as you are at the heart of pigalle but if you want to sleep early don t get a room looking at the street
