with so many great hotels in paris to stay in this one is truly disappointing the concept is nice the interior decor is visually appealing and the bathrooms are nice that s pretty much where the good stops the rooms are not insulated at all bring your ear plugs the staff are too cool to be pleasant to their own guests really unwelcoming and uninterested in serving their guests there is a weird hour between and where they stop serving breakfast and don t serve brunch yet which is a total bummer when you arrive at on sunday morning and can t get anything to eat bottom line don t waste your time on this hotel there are so many other parisian hotels that actually like receiving guests
