this booking was a complete disappointment the hotel is old and worn down with cracks in the walls and stained carpets although i had requested a double bed i was given a room with two singles the desk clerk asserted i had received what i had requested despite being shown my email stating the contrary accessing the hotel requires passing through the pub which is problematic when the pub is closed in the morning after leaving the hotel in the morning around to go to an atm i had to knock at the door and wait for the staff to let me back in the free wifi requires entering your mobile number and waiting for a code this doesn t work with a tablet or laptop we saw that the staff had attempted to acquire the code for another customer but the effort was not successful
