we stayed on the top floor and the water pressure wasn t very good at all sort of to be expected in an old building but wasn t ideal also the bath was sloped at both ends which made it very difficult to get under the water a bit strange on our first morning breakfast was until and continental buffet we arrived at to be told we were too late a bit odd although we explained we d just pick up what we wanted in minutes and was fine
