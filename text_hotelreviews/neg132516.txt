the shower leaked from the top which was higher than the shower door so the bathroom was soaked by the time i got out of the shower one of the curtains was hanging off the rail so we couldn t close it properly and when the room was serviced in the morning the curtain was not put back up one of the windows slid shut every time we opened it which was a bit of a nightmare as it was a particularly hot couple of days it could also cause an injury
