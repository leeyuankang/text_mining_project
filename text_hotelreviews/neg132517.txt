we really cannot complain the only small annoyance for us was getting luggage to and from the rooms which are laid out in an odd way although there is a small lift to rooms once on room level the short corridors with self closing fire doors and short stairs dividing individual hallways make it a bit more challenging to drag luggage through this is not a huge deal and cannot be helped due to the age design of the building only a teeny inconvenience for such a lovely stay
