the hotel is in same building as the mitre pub but only a very small sign outside said so which is easy to miss stairs were narrow steep and twisty spiral thankfully there was a small lift all of the hotel admin was done in the noisy and crowded pub breakfast was also in the pub and was only continental style with no option of cooked alternative even at extra cost wifi didn t work at all not even in public areas
