actual pub part of the building is fine but the bedrooms are dire very shabby staircase with stained carpet scuffed battered paintwork gives a really poor impression when going up to the rooms carpets are bad throughout and need changing as a matter of urgency rooms are ok minimalist with shabby cheap furniture grubby looking curtains and ill fitting net curtains at least in the two rooms we saw bed was comfortable but pillows are cheap and need replacing there are also plumbing issues apparently let s hope our experience was a one off generally in need of refurbishment and some money spending on it could be great as the location is fab
