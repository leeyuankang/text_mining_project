no clue how the wifi worked it said in the guest info book that you had to text to get a code or something to connect to the private wifi but there was only a free wifi service available not sure if that was a change made after the info book was printed but the wifi sucked regardless good thing london has excellent not that much of a drawback for only a one night stay
