confusing reception having to ask staff behind the bar very tatty decor in bedroom net curtains had holes in and were split very noisy in the night coming from outside area as it was as pub had shut it sounded like possibly could be the bar staff i was on floor with room that looked at the church but could hear them shouting and laughing until nearly midnight wish the windows had been double glazed then i wouldn t have minded how long the partied the shower room was very small and the shower door meant u had to stand under shower as it turned on with really cold water no possibility of allowing it to warm up before you stood under water only mirror in room was in bathroom which means if u want to use hairdryer then bring an extension lead there is a perfect spaces for mirror above the unit in bedroom so don t know why there isn t one the lift is very noisy and shudders when stopping also the doors stick partially open before opening properly which was off putting
