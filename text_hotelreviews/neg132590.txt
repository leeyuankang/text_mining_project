the breakfast the food was very basic with cheap orange juice and croissants the lady in charge of the breakfast was quite miserable when we asked for a table to be cleared we then had to ask again for it to be cleaned on both days it was not that there were lots of people there for breakfast the coffee was cold on the second day but was afraid to ask for more was going to order the full breakfast at extra cost but after seeing the continental breakfast decided not to bother
