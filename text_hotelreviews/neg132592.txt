the shower whilst clean on the tiles and tray was black with damp mould around the shower tray and between the tiles where there should have been clean grouting there was no bulb in the light over the bathroom mirror which did not please my wife on returning from visiting the local attractions at about pm on the we wished to shower and go out for dinner however on attempting to use the shower we found there was no hot waster coming through this we found to be the same for the tap on the bathroom sink we reported this to the manager who advised she would investigate we were therefore unable to shower or wash prior to going out for dinner on our return at approx pm we found the situation with the hot water to be unchanged we once again spoke with the manager who advised us that there was a problem with the boiler which she did not understand after much discussion and she making a phone call the her manager we were advised that the hotel did not have hour maintenance support and the issue would not be resolved until tomorrow we advised that we found this unacceptable we had not been able to wash or shower the whole of the evening we would have to go to bed washing with cold water and there was to be no hot water when we arose in the morning to allow us to shower the manager advised she had a bar to run and could not help us any more her manager would see us in the morning to speak about compensation she did provide us with a complementary drink i find the fact that a hotel of this nature has no out of hours maintenance support to be totally unacceptable to leave guest for of fourteen hours without hot water to bathe cannot be justified my wife and i arose in the morning had a cold wash breakfast and then instead of enjoying our planned day at the tall ships festival drove home to northamptonshire in order that we could shower and clean ourselves properly
