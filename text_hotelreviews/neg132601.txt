this shouldn t be listed with parking it s non existent and is street parking on a meter if you can find a place where do i start the entrance was locked forcing us to enter with luggage through a busy bar the receptionist was unhelpful and didn t mention wifi or breakfast the lift is filthy dirty black with grime the room was blazing hot the windows didn t open properly they are sash and slam down when opened the wifi doesn t reach the room the room itself how this property ever got a rating is totally beyond me more like non star rated the room is much more basic than anything i ve ever stayed in the shower controls are fiddly un user friendly and it was hopeless trying to get a decent temperature the shower head is not detachable and fixed miles above head height so the useless spray is even more useless because you can t detach it and bring it closer the free bath gel dispenser was broken breakfast poor selection not a coffee machine only old coffee being kept hot in jugs the morning receptionist was pleasant compared to the night staff never again
