only decaf coffee granules in the room and the maid didn t give us proper coffee even though we asked very small gripe but it was annoying no hair dryer in room but to be fair i didn t ask for one they may have them on request pillows were thin but again we didn t ask for more so can t really complain as we didn t give them a chance to rectify it
