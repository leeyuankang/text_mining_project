the mattresses were like cardboard on top of a sprung mattress pretty uncomfortable compared with some hotel beds the windows are lovely single glazed sashes it s probably a grade listed but secondary double glazing would mean that the traffic wasn t in the room with you and the curtains didn t have black out material so the room was full of orange light all night from the street in addition to the green light from the exit sign over the door all in all it was a great pity especially as my daughter had an important audition the following morning and i had hoped she would arrive for it refreshed too many corners cut by the owners on what could otherwise have been a very enjoyable night that would have led to repeat custom apparently we are not the only guests to have remarked on the poor night time light exclusion but no action has been taken
