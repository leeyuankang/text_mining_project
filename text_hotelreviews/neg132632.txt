i would suggest changing the shower bathtub handle it is fixed to the wall high up so i found that every time i wanted to have a shower i would have to adjust my body position or the shower head itself so that the water wouldn t reach everywhere drenching the floor a hand held shower head would be much comfier especially for those of us who don t want to get our hair wet
