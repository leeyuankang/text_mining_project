there was no dedicated check in so you have to go via the bar to access hotel reception and find someone but the staff don t seem trained in this so its all a bit bumpy no one told us about breakfast and we had to ask where our room was when it came to arriving back after a gig at the we were told to just ring the bell for the night attendant but we were stood outside for minutes in the cold waiting for him to come and unlock the door no security check or asking for our room numbers either with another guests as well its a little run down but is ok for a one night stop over if seeing something at the
