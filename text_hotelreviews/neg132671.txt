we booked months before my wife traveling separately from me went to check in only to be told that i had already done so in fact i was still traveling and hadn t checked in consequently our original room had been given to someone else so we were given one which unfortunately was on the floor on the street side so traffic noise was an issue all night as were the noisy drunken crowd under our window until a m the latter not the hotel s fault in hindsight we should have taken the off road floor room option we were offered however we only booked for one night so wasn t too bad
