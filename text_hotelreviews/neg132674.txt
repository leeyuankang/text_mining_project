noisy the pub closes at p m and i was told that i could use the other door the supposed main door and ring the bell this caused me anxiety because there wasn t a person at the reception at all times i didn t like at all the fact that i couldn t buy something form the bar at i m talking about a bag with potato chips nothing that requires preparation yes the bar was officially closed but all the personnel was still around when i told them that they could charge it on my room they told me that the pub runs separetely from the hotel but still we had breakfast at the pub btw wasn t great at all no bread just greasy croissants one two apples or bananas and cerals this hotel pub collaboration wasnt very efficient despite the room was clean the cover of the chairs was full of stains the bath did not have any handrails for disabled people and was very slippery hot room
