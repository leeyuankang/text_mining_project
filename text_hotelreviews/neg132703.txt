very warm bedroom and bathroom on a very warm day room radiator warm ish to touch was the heating on didn t spoil sleep thankfully but made it a nightmare to apply makeup and to dress for the graduation ceremony we were attending it was such a relief to check out and breathe in some relatively fresh air maybe better to stay here in winter
