the man who booked us in was very frazzled and wasn t at all helpful regarding using the hotel for dinner he wasn t prepared to book us in a table at the hotel as it was quiz night so having driven up from the south in the rain all we wanted was a meal noisy atmosphere or not it was our call if we wanted to brave it so we had to go out and it was disappointing to say the least couldn t fault the breakfast the girls were very helpful and gave us assistance when one of our party was sick over night
