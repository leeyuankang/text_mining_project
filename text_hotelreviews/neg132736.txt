i think this hotel could do with an information pack about using the hotel we weren t given anything on arrival so it should be in the room we could not call reception or get through to anyone at all so we had to go down to the pub to ask for help there was no information in the room regarding using the tv iron availability room service breakfast times or even how to get back in once the pub had closed my mother in law is and had her own room which had loose tiles in the bathroom this was very hazardous for her also we had requested a double bed but we got two singles joined together which was a lovely size but not very comfortable
