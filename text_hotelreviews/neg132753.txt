no car parking despite what the booking page stated too noisy at night noisy drunks and rubbish trucks late at night i would not recommend this hotel for london marathon participants i barely slept and was so stressed about trying to find a car park ended up miles away that it ruined my weekend i wanted a chilled day before the race i didn t get this wished i had gone to novotel up the road
