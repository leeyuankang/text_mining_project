didn t sleep well because the room was uncomfortably warm despite the radiators being off there seemed to be a lot of heat coming through the floor even with the window wide open to the noisy streets it was a sweaty sticky night and this was early april despite the positives to this great place this alone means that we won t be returning unless the rooms are fitted with air conditioning
