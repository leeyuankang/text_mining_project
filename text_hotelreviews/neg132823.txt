the staff were ok a little rude and didn t make us feel very welcome on arrival the man who checked us in was more like a robot more like a practice speech and not very personal told us when breakfast was served during in the week and weekend as were only staying one night at the weekend we didn t really need to hear the rest of the week the same was said about closing etc we came back to the pub quite late and decided to have a few drinks before bed we heard the last orders bell so sent my partner back in to get a final round but were rudely told by the same man that had checked us in that they had stopped serving the bell had literally just been rung didn t make sense perhaps they had forgotten to ring the bell earlier but still annoying weatherspoons just down the road open till cheaper drinks and much more welcoming place to be the room was ridiculously hot we had the fan on all night and windows open but still it was impossible to sleep not what i would class as star there was only decaff coffee in the room and it was nescaf a poor mans coffee in my opinion and the service a breakfast was appaluling not one person asked if we had slept well or even took our breakfast order the continental breakfast was adequate but not having yogurts on top of ice big mistake warm yogurt poorly stomach all in all pleasant enough place for the money but the staff could do with training in manners and service skill
