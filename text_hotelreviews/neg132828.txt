price high although this is valid for london in general we found a burnt bulb in the bathroom on arrival they promised to replace it the same day a matter of a couple of hours a special bulb they didn t until the end of our stay four days the flooring in the lift is completely worn out and with a bad smell astonishing as it would cost next to nothing to replace it we don t mind paying on arrival but we dislike being asked to do it with an explanation this is the hotel s policy especially when there is a two month prior reservation and credit card pre authorization the place is advertised as offering free wi fi it doesn t you are instructed to follow a procedure entering a mobile phone number in your phone tablet etc in the end it turns out your own operator is charging you from somewhere in the world the name innkeeper s lodge as given on the reservation sheet does not appear on the front of the building and there is no warning in the reservation on the building you see the mitre instead we had to walk to and fro around the building for ten minutes to find out it was the same place
