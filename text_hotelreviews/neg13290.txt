our hotel room was a little small the bath had high sides and was difficult and dangerous to climb in and out for showering definitely a no go for anyone with mobility issues the separate wc was tiny and a squeeze to get into and close the door a wall telephone was place at hip height so often knocked on in error we didn t receive nightly turn down as expected and raised this with the hotel
