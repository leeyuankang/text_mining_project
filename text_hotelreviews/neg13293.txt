i was appalled by server who refused me to sit at the dinner one evening stating that i did not nook for donner despite that i told hom i was staying at the hotel it took other servers to give me a table clearly it was not an issue of space or lack of food it is somply that he did not want me to be served for someone who paid more than euro this hotel needs to select its employees as this is a very bad sign
