note we had a stay of a week steep stairs if you have heavy luggage as no lifts but manageable power points are not positioned well and are located near the balcony door and are hard to access as they are behind stairs and a heater there are no power points in the bathroom for electrical items a mirror on the wall near the clothes cupboard would help as you need to use the power points near the balcony there is a small desk area under the stairs but no lighting changing one of the lights outside the bathroom to a movable light would help or a lamp which could be plugged in at the power points
