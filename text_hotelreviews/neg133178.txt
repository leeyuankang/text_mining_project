the room was called a suite however it was actually small having a slightly separate area with a small settee in it does not make a room a suite it also had no tea coffee facilities no fridge only two small towels each a small wardrobe with little storage for a longer stay amongst other things basically for the price you would have expected more which makes it over priced whilst it is a nice hotel i would not stay again at the current prices they charge
