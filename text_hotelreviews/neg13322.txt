very soft pillows when asked for firmer pillows staff brought more soft pillows have found same problem at sofitel wentworth in sydney one lift out of service out of three not enough to move guests quickly out of very small lobby area great nespresso machine in room was appreciated but not enough pods or milk housekeeping brought us more but i think it always looks a little penny pinching especially in a star hotel when only just enough is provided for one cup of coffee
