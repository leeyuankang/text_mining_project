we paid for a deluxe room based on the pictures shown on booking com annoyingly the pictures shown with the delux room don t relate to that room so we ended up with a room much smaller than we thought we were getting for anyone that s interested the pictures shown are mostly of the suites the normal and delux rooms are much smaller with no stairs in them the service in the bar restaurant can be quite slow the staff are nice they just seem to leave you for quite a long time without seeing what you d like
