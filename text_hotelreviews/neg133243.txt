we did not realize it during our booking but there actually isn t a hour person at the reception this normally is not a problem for us but one of the other guests got locked out of the hotel one night that guest knocked on our door at telling us that he had been locked out and needed help it completely startled us also there was not a peep hole on the door to see who was there
