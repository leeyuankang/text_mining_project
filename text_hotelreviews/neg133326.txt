wifi slow and stops sometimes bathroom no tooth brush and toothpaste but i guess it is common in europe room asked for iron to fix up my clothes during fashion week and nothing was brought up ever there are no outlet for charging phone next to the bed only near the desk or near bathroom wall the sound proof was horrible that we kept on hearing our neighbour and their tv there was always a muggy humid smell in the room every time we come back from the outside maybe because there isn t a fan or ventilation in the bathroom so humidity stays inside the room the hangers were very annoying to use environment there are two lifts but still takes years to go downstairs
