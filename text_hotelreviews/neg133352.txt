first night we were given room no and from am we were woken up by deliveries trollies being pushed and extremely noisy elevator bottom mechanism that was only on other side of a thin wall it was so bad we had to take ear plugs and stuff them in our ears to manage a bit more sleep room no should not be given to guests unless they are seriously hearing impaired
