very noisy our room was right behind the lift and the lift was very load so my wife was unable to sleep in my opinion that room should not be used as a bedroom and should be converted to a storeroom or something else it s just not suitable for someone to sleep in i felt the area around was a little soulless lots of high end shops but no atmosphere or energy
