first given room on the first floor at the front which was incredibly noisy and also had the smell of smoke coming from the street so we had to move there is a small bar very near the hotel and when it closes the street gets busy with people chatting and unless its raining all the smokers stand outside in the street next given room which is on the ground floor at the back of the hotel and much quieter
