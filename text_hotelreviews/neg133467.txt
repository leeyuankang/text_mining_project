it s definitely not a proper star hotel not organised with regards to room cleaning cleaners walked into the room within a span of one hour without knocking furthermore no one helped with the baggage during check out they have a day tax of approx euro which must be payed in cash personally i think it s to evade taxes when hotels request for cash to be paid the front desk staff were friendly the shower drainage was not sufficient and would fill up during a shower i suppose coming from the middle east the hotel standards are very high and as a result most european hotels can t compare you need to lower your expectations
