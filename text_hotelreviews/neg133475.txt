personal i have made the reservation and paid the total money by master card on internet weeks before my travel and i thought everything was ok but just because i did not had my card with me they would not give me the room they demand i pay cash and then they told me that if i choose to change to another hotel they will use my card information and take the total money from my account too much stress they have really destroyed my trip how can it be possible that they could use the card if i changed the hotel but they would not use the card when i stayed at the hotel i went to paris to shop but i could not do that because i have to pay the hotel cash and i did not have my card with me
