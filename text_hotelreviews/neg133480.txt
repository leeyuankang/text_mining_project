staff were unhelpful we booked a superior room and we had a box room on the top floor that felt like a prison it was covered in dust above the bed phoned to complain about constant noise but staff did not care felt like we were dealing with robots who were reading from scripts ordered room service and did not come even after i called twice to see where our drinks were her reply was my colleagues are busy but i ll ask again finally after three hours i phoned and got transferred to another person who got them within minutes poor service and overpriced
