the most dissapointing trip ever the hotel has the most ridiculous and complicated procedures ever prepare all the documents for that trip because you don t know what they may need they took the payment for the stay twice and took them weeks to return it if i didn t get help from booking i don t know if i ever would get my money back the director was rude she ignored me and my emails it s a beautiful hotel and fantastic location but
