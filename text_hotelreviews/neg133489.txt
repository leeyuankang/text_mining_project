there was heavy construction works going on in the hotel from the early hours of friday all throughout the day and from ver early on monday morning this was very disrupting to us as it woke us up very early and was a source of constant irritation this should have been communicated before we booked as we would not have stayed here had we known we found this very disturbing the staff were clearly under huge pressure as they were receiving multiple complaints from staff and as a result not giving the customers good service
