we were charged euros for damage we didn t cause to a mirror in the room we were not even questioned by the hotel our card was just charged and invoice sent which was disappointing and upsetting we spent over euro in phone calls following up to ensure they understood it was not any of our doing and the mirror was cracked when we arrived so long as this doesn t happen again we would stay there again the hotel was stunning and a great location
