this was not a star hotel by any means they do not have a concierge they do not have a lobby only a hallway with a desk they do not clean your room unless you ask they do not give you shampoo and conditioner unless you ask they do not have irons in the rooms they do not have luggage racks in the rooms these are all staples of a star hotel which they claim to be on top of all of that they have construction going on the hotel was not remotely close to being full and they wanted to put us directly over the construction we had to ask to be someplace higher above it and the best they could do is move us up to two floors above the construction this is not a star hotel experience stay away
