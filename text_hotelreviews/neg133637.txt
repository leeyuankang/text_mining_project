the first morning s breakfast was not acceptable cold buffet was reasonable but the cooked food was not acceptable tomatoes small were cooked far too much the hash browns although not appearing overcooked were hard and couldn t be cut with a knife i saw one gentleman try to do that fail and then eat it in his fingers like a biscuit scrambled eggs were not appealing also no staff serving tea or coffee you had to make it yourself not acceptable in that standard of accommodation also the bedroom corridors were very dark and gloomy
