while arrival front desk has blocked an amount from my credit card more than the room price for nights as a deposit we forgot to ask for cancellation while departure and we have paid the rooms cost by cash while leaving the hotel after we returned to our country and asked for the cancellation of the blocked amount with the scanned copies of the invoices they still don t care and tell that they will cancel in two weeks time my credit card is needlessly blocked right now and sent several e mails requesting for their support but they sent an generic e mail to me and don t assist and support additionally rooms are heated with aircondition there is no central heating it was a very old infrastructure and the machine was making too much noise itwas really hard to sleep you have to choose sleeping or closing the aircondition and getting cold actually i preffered closing in the most cold season unfortunately
