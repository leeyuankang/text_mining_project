check out was but after coming back to the room at on morning of check out wasn t able to use room keys to get in had to find someone to open door was then in a rush to get to transport on time to airport felt i overpaid for a room with a view to an alleyway i understand there have to be some rooms without the best view which i don t necessarily have a problem with but i don t think it was discounted or should have cost less than i paid in any case
