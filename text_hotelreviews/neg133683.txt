everything was horrible over priced for a hotel that looks like a hotel from the s hotel was super outdated the entire hotel atmosphere is so sad the furniture was literally so old that if you would ve sat on it it could fall apart no bell man to carry out baggage so we had to do it ourselves i ve never seen a brand name hotel so horrible i would personally not recommend this hotel to anyone unless you have realllllyyyyy low standards
