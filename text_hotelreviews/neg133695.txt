coffee is dreadful with all in my group expressing disgust both filtered at breakfast as well as the alternative machine for this price of hotel this is an easy fix and needs serious attention when booking an extra night accommodation to the days we had stayed i was quoted times multiplier to the previous room rates needless to say we moved hotels demand had increased but i actually went up to a star hotel minute walk and saved just over gbp per night on what holiday inn wanted to charge so no appreciation of the days prior business or to incentivize a return i suggest they look at their policy
