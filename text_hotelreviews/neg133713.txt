when we first arrived i approached reception and waited for someone to call me forward as one out of receptionists were busy with a resident query i was then ignored for several minutes receptionists looked across down at me from their reception desk and continued to work at their computers another couple then stepped in front of me and were asked how they could be assisted straight away when i mentioned it at the desk when i was eventually spoken to it was dismissed without apology i also didn t like the height of the reception for a wheelchair user it is far above head height which poses problems i couldn t sufficiently reach the card machine which could have left my pin exposed if the reception was busy as the reception was so high i felt that i was being talked down to which was a shame as all the other staff were brilliant
