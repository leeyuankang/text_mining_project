we liked that when we got in our room we had balloons tied near the bed towels on the bed in a shape of a swan bunch of lovely flowers then a lovely bottle of wine and fruit was bought up to us what a lovely surprise the receptionist couldn t do enough for us so once again we would like to say a big thankyou and would visit again due to the location
