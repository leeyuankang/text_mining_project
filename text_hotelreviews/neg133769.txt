there wasn t much i didn t like other than the fact that there weren t many facilities at least i didn t notice things like a pool or gym but i understand this is london and such facilities are not easy to come by in hotels although the hotel does offer a discount on breakfast for guests staying there i would have liked for it to be included free but i understand that doing so would probably have resulted in higher room charges so i guess a discount is a good compromise on the whole i was very pleased with the hotel and had a lovely stay
