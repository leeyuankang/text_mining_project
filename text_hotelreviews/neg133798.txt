the breakfast service is bad i had to change into room service for breakfast due to early departure but the room service just cancelled the order they said it s written on the breakfast order card that no hot food would be served before so they just didn t deliver the breakfast until very last minute after i asked about it so i looked at the photo i took about the breakfast order card ya sorry i am a nerd and take photo record of a lot of things and no where was written about no hot food is served in any period of time it s just a bad experience in addition to the room that might need refurnished the location is alright not perfect
