overall the hotel itself is nice with clean rooms initially when checking in i found the hotel staff member extremely rude i requested a twin room when booking online and when i arrived to check in the hotel staff member stated i had not requested this despite showing her a screenshot of my booking her only suggestion was to pay an upgrade fee of to get two double beds she came across extremely aggressive and rude the issue of the twin room really wouldn t have bothered me it was the attitude and rudeness of the staff member that really upset me after being presented with the room key i walked over to the lift and up to the floor only to find out the key card didn t work so back downstairs i went with my luggage to the same staff member who offered no apology and simply issued me another key without saying a word whilst getting the key i overheard other customers booking in having the same issue regarding having booked a twin room and being told to pay an upgrade fee as there is no twin available seems like a sales tactic being used moving on i needed a glass of water so waked to the bar and asked for a glass to take to my room the staff member demanded to see my room key and tell her my room number prior to handing over an empty glass unbelievable i left the hotel extremely unsatisfied which was a shame as the hotel itself is nice shame about the staff members that i encountered not the customer experience i would have expected for a hotel in the heart of mayfair
