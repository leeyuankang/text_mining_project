shower took long time to heat water up many dishes not available on the room service menu and could not have first choice of my main or desert bar maid in the bar poured me the wrong drink requested extra duvet to be told there were no extra in the building and that there was no house keeping on at at night and if i had told them in the morning maybe they could arrange this had to phone twice to get razors dropped off to room waited minutes in the morning for a lift room overall not a brilliant stay and a shame considering i work around the corner from this hotel and could use it regularly
