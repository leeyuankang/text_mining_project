foyer was a mess only place to relax was the bar and that was not comfortable enough to stay for more than a drink or two we had a very cold spell and it was draughty the first room whilst ok for a honey moon couple was totally unacceptable for any one over or afraid of hights the second room was huge cold and paint in need of repair the hotel states it is four star but is not it feels like a up graded backpackers it is basic clean no frills or comfort three star max i thought i was booking a comfortable picturesque hotel it felt like and old school building we later found out that is exactly what it it was the hotel was under going major re constructions to the foyer entrance area nothing was mentioned at time of booking it was very disappointing and embarrassing as i had also made the booking for our friends who we were travelling with very expensive hotel with nothing to make up for the expensive rooms
