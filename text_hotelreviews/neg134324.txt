i have ordered one room with two single beds but we got one room with one double bed room was really small for two people we had just enough space to go around the bed room was way too hot in the bath was very little space too you can hardly turn around yourself very overpriced hotel for what it is through the window in the room i saw in the bathroom of another guest it is a little bit creepy weird just one small wardrobe in whole room definitely it is not star hotel except price the price is too high for what you get
