we had booked for a one night stay to attend a concert in the area and the receptionist that checked us in rather than say that the booking had come through with my surname as my christian name and that i was male he proceeded to imply that i was not the person who had made the booking despite the fact that they had all my details just round the wrong way this attitude was unsettling and angered my partner who tried to contact the hotel group that novotel belong to only to be told that because the booking was done through booking com there wasn t anything they could do which was surprising and indicates that their system for receiving bookings from other agents needs reviewing and their staff trained better to deal with potential errors to make matters worse when we had lunch in the bar and tried to put this on our room bill we were told that the same receptionist had not authorised my card for this facility and had only taken payment for the room authorising cards on check in is standard practice in my experience therefore i m not sure why this was not done as it meant all additional purchases had to be paid for separately although this situation was not resolved we were at least offered two free drinks by way of an apology after making a complaint the contemporary decor seems to disappear in the rooms the bath was actually just a shower as it had no actual taps and was small the water ran hot and cold intermittently for some reason having upgraded to a superior room the sofa bed was made up as two single beds and when we tried to restore it back to a sofa we were only able to retract half of the sofa the aircon was poor to almost non existent however the weather had been exceptionally hot but would have expected the aircon to be able to cope
