the lift is small it says it fits three people but it s cosy for two this is not unusual in paris we chose to take the very pretty winding staircase instead sometimes there was no space for us in the breakfast room so we had to wait until a table was free timing was not an issue for us but it was a little uncomfortable standing in a room full of people waiting for them to eat up these minor points are down to the architecture of the building and would not prevent us from using this hotel again
