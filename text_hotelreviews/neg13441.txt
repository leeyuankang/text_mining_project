we stayed overnight to visit wimbledon and asked in the morning before we left for wimbledon if me may leave our car in the car park until we returned at night the very friendly girl at reception said yes no problem just come in at night to validate the ticket when we returned a very hapless young man took ages to validate the ticket moving from computer to computer and finally telling us we would be charged we found this very steep and frankly were very surprised to be charged at all if we had parked in a parking garage off site we would have paid around if the parking garage had been full we would gladly have paid extra for our parking but it was virtually deserted paying just under a for the night for a basic twin room we would have thought parking would be included or at a very reduced rate the breakfast in the morning was excellent with very friendly efficient staff
