space was a little cramped but for us it worked because we didn t spend a lot of time in the room my only change would be to book a room with a king or queen size bed opposed to twin beds we were still very comfortable and slept very well the dining room for breakfast in the mornings was a little tight with space but it was manageable the scrambled eggs were not the best but just meant we ate more bread and croissants
