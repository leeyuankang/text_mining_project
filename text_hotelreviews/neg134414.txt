one of the reception staff was very rude to us and made us feel uncomfortable after we made the mistake of asking him to order us a taxi to the charles du gauld airport and needed the gard du nord it was a minute phone call and we realised whilst he was on the phone so he didn t have to phone back but he tutted and huffed and berated us to the taxi company very rude
