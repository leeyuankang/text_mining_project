the entrance is designed for coaches and while it is not far to walk to the tube station it is not a pedestrian friendly walk due to the entrance design being at the furthest away from the most direct path to the hammersmith tube and some construction poorly designed pathway and coach parking at the entrance level also the hotel is so large that you may need to walk a long distance to your room this was okay for me but if you have a lot of luggage or trouble walking long distances you might want to know this
