staff on reception kept you waiting whilst on the phone having a smoke doing other things you as a customer were definitely not important minutes wait with no one else checking in is a bit of a joke especially for the rate per room and being a so called hotel room was very small and by the road so beware of the early morning dustcarts if placed in the front of the hotel window didn t close properly so a bit noisy
