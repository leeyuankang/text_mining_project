staff could be more attentive and friendly overall the stay was nowhere near value for the amount paid toilet paper in bathrooms was poor room dining choice was poor expected more in provided room facilities considering the room price paid such as caffeinated coffee only decaffeinated provided a few more biscuits etc ultimately the room was not much better than a travelodge but at least double the price
