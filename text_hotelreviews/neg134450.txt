the lift is tiny for one with little luggage the breakfast room is too small for the amount of guests it was difficult to manoeuvre between tables to get to the buffet on the morning i was leaving there was only one member of staff to serve coffee and lay tables i hardly had time to drink my coffee when it arrived even after allowing mins for breakfast at euros it was overpriced the croissants were not as you d expect in paris more like the supermarket pre packed ones the breakfast staff were very nice just a shame that the food offerings and breakfast room were a big let down
