the staff was very friendly and helpful but i asked a hotel to book a taxi to the hotel near disneyland the first day they said the price is euro second day they said price will be euro we were adults and children but anyway i think price is too high the van came minutes late there was no taxi sign no taximeter no navigation the driver didn t know the location and i believe he knew only chinese when i asked why the price is so high he said that for him for city and for the hotel is it a common practice in paris
