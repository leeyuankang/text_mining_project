umm i have stayed a few times now over the last months i stay there because it s close to my elderley fathers flat and i go to see him the superior rooms are a little tired bathrooms have mould on the fittings carpets tend to need a bit of a clean this time the door into the room looked like it had been kicked hard at the bottom and the lock was loose i did tell the reception staff when i checked out executive rooms tend to be nicer but are a lot more expensive i don t tend to eat there as the breakfast is so expensive
