lady who checked us in was rather rude and unwelcoming not the best first impression to give breakfast was a bit hit and miss hard pancakes very runny scrambled egg and tea pots could do with a serious scrub also the tea and sugar supply in room was a bit stingy only teabags and sugars which is fine if you drink coffee too as there was plenty of that but sadly i only drink tea
