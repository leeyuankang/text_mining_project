one of the other reasons we choose this hotel was it stated in the details that the hotel had air conditioning it does not its rooms are air cooled we stayed on one of the hottest nights of the year and had an extremely uncomfortable night we complained in the night and the next morning when we were told the rooms are air cooled the hotel gave us two complimentary breakfasts and took our bar bill off the final bill as compensation for our unpleasant night thank you novotel it would be worth checking with the hotel and altering the incorrect details on your website
