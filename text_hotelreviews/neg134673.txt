check in reception very badly organised and poorly staffed long waits poor facilities in terms of waiting area as small reception which then got packed out hotel was fully booked but clearly not set up to manage it despite the room clearly having been upgraded there was significant damp in the shower which meant the whole bathroom smelt of it
