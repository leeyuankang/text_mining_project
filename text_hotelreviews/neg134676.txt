i would never return to this hotel first point the hotel is advertised with parking facility s for the hotel in the residential area i rang the hotel the day before arriving the receptionist instructed me to ring up hour before arriving at the hotel so when i did this the receptionist told me there was no car parking facility s for the hotel i was already on my way to london this upset me massively and made me angry when i arrived i parked in the area and approached the hotel i was checked in by a trainee who didn t tell me what time breakfast was just handed me my key and that was that and placed us on the highest floor with no elevator this should be stated on the add as it s absolutely shocking how many stairs you have to climb i m years old which is fine but anyone older would struggle massively
