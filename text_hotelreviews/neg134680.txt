when i first arrived and checked in the person helping me was not experienced but tried to be very accommodating the other lady who she had to refer to was rude condescending and very unhelpful and untruthful the room was a closet that i could barely move around and she told me it was above a premium single when she tried to get the bell man to agree he was polite but he wasn t going to lie i was most unhappy with the room facing a brick wall bathroom was behind a fire door most inconvenient it was only after trying to heat the room for an hour with no luck it was freezing that they moved me to a slightly larger but much more comfortable room they did send a kind note afterwards with a fruit plate which made me happier but i still couldn t shake off the rudeness of the desk duty clerk if i were management i would move her to a position of less interaction with customers other than that all was good nice place in a great location i was even able to overlook the noise of construction next building over but not the rudeness
