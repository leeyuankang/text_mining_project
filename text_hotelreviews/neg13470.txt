the fact that our room was on the third floor and so far away from the lifts the carpet makes it hard to pull our trolley bags and the distance to the lifts which was on the other side of the building as mentioned was too far the windows looked out onto a roof i did ask for a nice view however i was told that the twin rooms were all on the third floor and that was the only view
