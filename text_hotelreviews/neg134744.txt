the check in was overly complicated and having to pay for breakfast the next morning due to a deal was bizarre i had to show email bookings so glad i had kept it felt like they thought we d run away the breakfast was over booked by the looks of it do sent away and called later my advice book times when taking bookings the paper cloth was not changed which was a little off putting the room was lovely but too small i had booked a deluxe double which i assumed was bigger but it was small the side lights didn t seem to switch off with any combination of switches not fun at
