the breakfast itself was very nice but expensive it helped a little if you paid in advance pounds versus if you just showed up that day but that s still a bit pricey when you compare it with their dinner menu little details like having the complimentary water bottle replaced an extra blanket etc were sometimes lacking but overall the place was very clean and comfortable
