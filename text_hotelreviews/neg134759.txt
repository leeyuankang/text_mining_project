i hated the room the tiny bed was corned right between walls terrible and uncomfortable way too soft mattress the gym is a joke half of the equipment didn t work i thought it was very rude that i was forced to pay upfront at checkin given the expensive rate i didn t expect to be bothered with all that right at checkin they should ve waited till checkout as any proper hotel does
