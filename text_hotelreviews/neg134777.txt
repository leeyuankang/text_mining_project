i was put in basement room wifi wasn t up to scratch which was disappointing as i needed to check urgent emails as it was a business trip also mobile phone signal was reduced due to basement location if wifi is a key requirement to you i would refuse to stay in basement rooms hopefully it is better in other parts of hotel but i cannot say for sure shower pressure is very low so not ideal if you are a woman need to wash long hair no mini bar but water given on arrival
