management was rude i had booked a room for myself and my infant with a cot when i arrived there was no room for the cot and the manager told me i should have read the website more carefully before booking the room to make sure a cot fit staff had even carried the cot up to the room with me before we worked out it wouldn t fit if staff didn t know how was a customer to know but they did offer me a larger room instead so it was sorted i was happy to pay the extra money for a bigger room i just didn t like being blamed
