when we arrived we were shown to a horrible room in the basement it didn t match the description of the room we booked on the website at all the room was tiny one of the panes of glass in the window was broken and the bed although advertised as a king was more like a double if that after about minutes reception called and asked us if we were happy with our room my husband said no and explained our concerns the receptionist said she would talk to her manager and call us back more waiting we were then told there was an executive room available which we could move to if we wanted we were then shown to a nicer room although still much smaller than the website suggested we agreed to move overall our impression was that they tried to scam us out of the room we booked and if we hadn t spoken up they would have left us in the horrible room in the basement
