the water for tea and coffee was cold i asked different members of staff for a hot cup of tea and coffee all that happened was they came and topped up the urn with a jug of hot water pouring on to the cold water in the urn the staff member then kept trying to light the small pot under the urn myself and my sister in law where taking our year old mum for a follow up appointment after having heart surgery a month ago i requested a accessible room for mum as she can not walk far we were given one room with a double bed when we requested a twin room and the other room over looking the flyover we were then moved to a twin room which was as far as could be from the lift this was a real struggle for mum to walk to the lift the only helpful person was a young man in the restaurant who got us a wheelchair for mum as we did not want to make her move rooms again the checking in took for ages and the young girl who did this only gave us one room although i gave her the booking form sorry to say she also had a body odour problem some one took over from her after about this was quite stressful as we had been travelling for hours to get to the hotel very disappointing for a large chain hotel
