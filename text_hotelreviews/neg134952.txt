very odd design of rooms in this novotel have stayed in a few you have a small separate toilet just behind the door no wash hand basin in addition energy saving bulbs take minutes to warm up so don t expect to see anything initially the actual bathroom is accessed from the main room just beside the bed around the corner as you enter in a superior twin very small bathroom shower i m not a big chap and to more easily access toiletries i had to place them in the bath also there really is insufficient storage space for your clothes i e drawers we lived out of our respective suitcases during the stay of nights
