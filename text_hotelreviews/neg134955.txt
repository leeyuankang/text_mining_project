the absolute ignorance of the pool by the staff the appalling and irresponsible behaviour of some guests and their children breaking all the rules what could lead to a trauma and severe hurt is absolutely not controlled by the staff no one never stopped it there is no staff near the pool some people jumping and taking all the small pool for themselves simply do not let other guests of the hotel to swim quietly tired customers have to argue with impolite people instead of relax after a hard business day the presence of staff fulfilling their duties correctly could help resolving this problem the hotel also could control and aloud the parents with kids under be in the pool only before at least p m i am generous there is some hotels with severe restrictions like p m to let the others relax after this time and it will be fair because lots of parents absolutely do not control their children s noisy and dangerous behaviour and even show the bad example themselves another thing my husband was absolutely furious leaving the shower he discovered a mum of teenagers inside mens changing room the manager who saw it it was minutes before closing did tell nothing yes we got that the pool is without surveillance and everything is our personal risk but i do not think the customers are ok with that is the pool a part of the hotel it works like not but it is surely included in the customers bill make it for additional price but control it or do something because the ignorance like this could not lead to anything right this is absolutely shameful for the overpriced hotel do not respect the customers i really think to find another hotel to stay next time and stop being a returning and loyal client
