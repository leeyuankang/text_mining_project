we have stayed many times at this hotel on this occasion we were put in a room that needed matainance this even flashed up on the computer but was still given to us door handle broken and the air condition did not work in hot may told our room would have a view when we got in to have a view of the next door office block looking into workers office this is classed as excecutive room staff in restaurant not friendly or welcoming a change in atmosphere from previous stays but overall disappointed this time with the hotel
