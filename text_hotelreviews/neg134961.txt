the reception staff were nice but the cleaning staff were disrespectful and talk to you like they are paying for the room not you they dont want to work or clean and if you tell them i need something changed or cleaned they are rude also they say they have free wifi this is a lie the wifi is free sure but it keeps on disconnecting every min and it is very slow like a snail so i ended up using my phones internet date
