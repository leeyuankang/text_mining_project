the rooms have last seen any renewal action probably around the carpet seemed slightly dirty and look quite old fashioned the shower pan had strong signs of aging plastic uneven and dirty looking off white same for the bathroom sink the huge tv was great the bad was not good but not bad either and the pillows were not that good they did smell great though the off white sheets and linen made me a bit suspicious of it not being clean enough though i got to the hotel early and asked if an early check in was possible they offered me an accessible room which i wouldn t have any problems with but the bathroom was smelling pretty bad once i contacted the reception about it though they offered me a new room very quickly and the room change was very smooth
