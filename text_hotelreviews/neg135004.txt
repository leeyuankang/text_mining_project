firstly it s a little tricky to get to we ended up going into paddington station down to the last platform and take the escalator to the next level then go past the taxi rank straight ahead and you will see some steps on your right leading to kingdom street the pool was lovely and warm for days unfortunately on our last morning it was freezing the people working in the bar and at breakfast are anything but friendly or helpful also in the morning it s very annoying when you are trying to eat and the plate is snapped from under you when you are not finished
