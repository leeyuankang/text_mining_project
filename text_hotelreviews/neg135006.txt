that we had to walk such a distance with our luggage because an officious man would not let the taxi driver through to drive to the hotel through the barrier down by the canal even though this had not been a problem the day before when we had been dropped off at the hotel the guy was not an employer of the hotel but the hotel need to get this sorted out before he does their business a lot of damage i don t like this idea of not having a proper reception area and having to check myself in with a machine this is supposed to be a hospitality industry having to do everything yourself when you are travel tired and stressed is not conducive to the feeling of hospitality it gives the same impression of welcome as a cheap airline the staff were generally helpful but it was clear that they were trained in the happy smiley over the top enthusiastic american way that involves repeating exactly the same phrases to you as each other to you you are left with the feeling that they are more focussed on remembering the words than concerned with what you need however i suppose it is a way of making all your guests feel as though they are being dealt with efficiently even if they don t feel that there is a genuine interest in you this is a new hotel after all and they are probably just bedding in all new staff i would go back and stay again in a few months to see if things have settled down then as these might all be just teething problems
