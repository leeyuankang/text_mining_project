after arriving back one evening we attempted to pre book the discounted breakfast only to be told we couldn t as it was too late and would need to pay full amount pre booking makes no difference to the amount of breakfast prepared in the kitchen so it was disappointing to be told we had missed the opportunity after returning just after midnight so we ate elsewhere and found a great place with a hot full english breakfast for half the cost anyway something to consider
