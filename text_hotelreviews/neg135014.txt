dining was made a miserable experience by the high volume pop muzak that was inescapable throughout the dining and bar areas this ensured that this time we never dined at the hotel but it certainly compromised the breakfast experience i m not sure of the purpose of the music as it was loud enough an impediment to conversation even across a table perhaps it is to entertain bored staff
