i couldn t find anything that i didn t like except for one thing which was the bathroom and that is totally a personal choice and not something that i expect others to find fault with the bidet was in a separate space to the basins and the shower box that would not have been a problem except that inside the bidet space there was no way to wash your hands except leave that space and go into the other space which meant opening a door with unclean hands everything is in one room so that space was literally two steps away from the basin so like i said personal preference
