very dissapointed with our room although location was good as had some skyline views we were next door to the ice machine and until early hours of the morning we could hear people talking whilst using the machine our room temp was uncomfortably hot the shower in our room was varying from cold to scolding hot making our morning shower far from pleasurable i had to leave washing my hair not at all pleasant i did report this to the reception but little was offered in compensation i feel for the price of our one night stay the whole visit was displeasing and not worthy of a higher rating than a premier inn
