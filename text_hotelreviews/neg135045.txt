paddington underground station is undergoing a refurb and you cannot get on or off the bakerloo line from there for what looks like a long time i specifically chose the hotel for ease of access to the tube and ended up having to walk minutes to warick ave to get on off however we did discover little venice in our walk about which is an absolute gem in the heart of london
