the facilities neither the sauna or the steam room was working on the sunday morning of our overnight stay i also booked separate beds for myself and my daughter well in advance of my stay but when i checked in i was told that no rooms were available and we had to share a bed which was very unsatisfactory i have used this hotel in london in the past and had nothing but positives about the place this trip was a bit of a disappointment
