second stay here and if i d have had this same experience the last time i stayed i honestly would have stayed in a premier inn and paid far less room was dated in need of a major revamp the room was filthy with tea stains up the wall the bed was rock solid and uncomfortable and the pillows were awful worst nights sleep ever i requested to pay for an upgrade but the hotel was packed and given that last time the room was lovely and i had no trouble i suspect they were at maximum capacity and using rooms they wouldn t normally all in all i wouldn t recommend this place and never intend to stay again
