parking charges we had two rooms and when we checked in we set off to our rooms to find one occupied and one unmade after return to reception and room swap we had an uncomfortable night down to poor aircon a complimentary breakfast was provided with an apology but this doesn t make up for our experience the hotel above needs a good refurb in my opinion
