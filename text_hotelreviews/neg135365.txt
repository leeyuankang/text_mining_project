the hotel was in renovations which was not communicated at any point before the arrival due to that the hotel gym which was one of my selection criteria was closed while the hotel provided vouchers for a gym next to the hotel it was crowded and honestly quite horrible with limited opening hours so not at all suited for business travellers that need easy access with flexible time in addition there was no hot water in the shower for the days that i stayed there even though i raised the point with the reception and while someone did come to fix it they did not fix anything and a cherry peak paper cups for coffee tea and water and an empty mini bar
