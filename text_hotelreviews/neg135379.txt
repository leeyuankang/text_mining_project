they are doing constructions one year and more from what they have informed us but we was going for vocation during christmas for relax for one week and it was terrible after my complain to the reception they inform me that they had mention that they are under renovation in booking site maybe it was somewhere mention in small letters and not clear enough for understand that you will not be able to sleep during vocation from noise for me is unacceptable hotel like hyatt doing this thinks every day from morning they was using hammer and tools for brake walls it was extremely noisy we was waking up with head ache every day this was absolutely not christmas vocation i am totally unhappy and disappointed from this experience
