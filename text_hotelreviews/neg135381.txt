breakfast was a waste of money staff in the dining room were unattentive and standing at their stations conversing with one another which could be heard over clientele ther were never more that clients in the dining room at one time isiswas there for over hours the hot food was cold and the layout and flow of the breakfast buffet is incredibly counter intuitive i would say arbitrary one of the staff had a loud and heated argument with a client and no manager or other staff made any effort to assuage the argument or resolve the issue the first day the food was cold and theb unattentive service was deplorable service staff stood around chatting amng themselves in and and would did not even take away my used dishes the only thing any staff did was to get me a mug of coffee when i first sat down from a machine yes i think i could have managed that by myself a woman was having trouble with the toaster no one went to help her if i could see this from across the room why didn t they see it so i decided to give the breakfast another try my second day because there was too much construction noise in my room again not much improvement the eggs were a bit warmer than the day before as i was leaving staff were standing chatting in the entrance where the podium is none of them would move out of the way so i could get past they just stood there looking at me like deer caught in the headlights euro for the breakfast was a waste of money i do not like to give bad reviews but this one was unavoidable
