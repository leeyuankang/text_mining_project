internet connection is horrible construction renovation work not good if you re visiting paris for vacation i ve complained since day and got response from guest relation only at the day of my nights stay no proper restaurant at the hotel no room service you re basically ordering food from a cafe in the mall downstairs and you pay a delivery fee price is too high taking into account you re just paying for bed without internet and breakfast other option like ac marriott would be a better option and it s common and we ll know in scandinavian countries they used to have a better staff at the lobby it used to be my favorite hotel in paris but this time i m extremely disappointed however i still give them a rating maybe it s due to the renovation work
