no tea and coffee making facilities in the room limited seats to sit in the lobby consierge staff unhelpful when we couldn t get into the room the lady hostess in the vue bar was incredibly rude it is obvious people go to the bar for the fabulous views of the city below so why she insists on putting you in the crappest seats with the worst views is beyond me then when you ask to move so you can see she shrugs as if you are the most unreasonable person in the world and is then rude
