i took my daughter for her birthday as a special treat to see the eiffel tower we spent a lot of money on two rooms in this hotel as it looked fabulous i thought i had booked an eiffel tower view however this wasn t the case i called to reception and was met with if you wanted that room you should have paid for it i had already paid per night per room for a club room i asked about upgrading and was met with a nothing is available and the phone going down after another minutes i went to reception and was offered to downgrade my room for the view for the same money firstly the room we had was pitiful for a club room when i saw the downgraded room i was disgusted club rooms also advertise an american style waffle breakfast which i am still waiting to experience too poor facilities poor hotel would definitely never stay here again thankfully my daughter did get her wish of going up the eiffel tower hyatt shocked by the standard
