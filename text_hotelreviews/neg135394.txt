the hotel is really old and while its clean things are faded and the furniture is is not so great although there was a notice that the place is being upgraded renovated so i guess in future it will be much much better for the money you pay i guess the best thing you get out of it is the location and the view the club access is good but the club itself if a bit outdated place heavily needs renovation
