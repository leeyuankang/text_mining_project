the whole setting is bad beginning with the point that they do not have a parking space so we had to use the public parking from the mall day the entrance is currently on the floor only to be accessed from inside the mall the whole hotel seems to be under construction and this is influencing the operation in a very bad way i ordered a delux room with kingsize bed i got a very small room with a double bed from to you hear very loud construction noise so no chance to rest or stay in the room during this time on booking com com was no information about the current situation construction and if you complain at the reception they tell you they can t do anything for you they don t even offered us a drink for free or something simple even the room service is just from illy brought in a bag do not order
