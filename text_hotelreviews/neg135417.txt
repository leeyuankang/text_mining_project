the ensuite bathroom had really cool double doors made of frosted glass unfortunately there was no lock on them and they didn t quite meet in the middle meaning zero privacy i wouldn t have liked to stay here with someone that i wasn t already entirely comfortable around on the other hand the bathroom suite itself was really nice the decor was a little outdated scuffed in places although i expect this will not be a problem when the renovation is complete we took this room at a huge discount because there were building renovation works going on having been told that the work was being carried out daily between we decided that wasn t a problem as we intended to be visiting the city between those hours however we were woken up by the sounds of hammering and sawing from what sounded like the room directly above us from as early as some days we were also woken up at one morning by cleaners vacuuming the hallway outside our bedroom door there was another occasion when a maid walked into our room without knocking at this made for an entirely unromantic honeymoon in fairness when we spoke to the concierge about the noise issues they were very sympathetic offered us free breakfast and some vouchers for drinks at the hotel bar as an apology lastly i wasn t sure what to expect from an expensive high end hotel having myself generally stuck to mid range or small independently owned hotels i left feeling distinctly underwhelmed although it was nice other than the view there wasn t anything else for me that set it above other places that i have stayed
