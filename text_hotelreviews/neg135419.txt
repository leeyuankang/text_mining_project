for the price i m not sure i d stay here again because it just didn t have a ton to offer compared to cheaper places i ve stayed breakfast not included and very pricey to add on not unusual for a major chain hotel i understand but i m still not going to do that with all the cafes so close by no pool although there was a fitness center at least when i went to use the luggage storage option there were at least employees standing at the desk who were all texting and talking amongst themselves and didn t even notice me until i said something to them
