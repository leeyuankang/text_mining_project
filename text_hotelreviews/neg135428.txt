this is my second stay at the hyatt regency paris etoile i have reserved a presidential suite for one night as i did in the first one on this stay i was given a different presidential suite from the last time the decoration on this one was outdated and cold and catered to adults and did not have the best view of paris while on the previous one the suite was warm and more children friendly with comfortable sofas it also had a beautiful view of paris the eiffel tower and other landmark the most troubling thing on this visit was when my family and i arrived into the suite while everything seemed cleaned and in order however when my wife checked the guest bathroom she immediately noticed that the toilet was used and not cleaned it was appalling i also noticed in the living area a tray with coffee and mugs i thought it was a welcoming gesture but when i checked carefully there was coffee in the mugs and it has been used i immediately went to the front desk and reported my complaint and asked for another suite unfortunately the other ones were all taken so the front desk promised me that they will get the bathroom cleaned and the tray picked up immediately however minutes later housekeeping did not show up and i had to call again until they showed up this time around needless to say there were no apologies from the hotel management and explanation how did this happen or someway to make up for this incident very disappointing finally because the king bed in one of suite bedrooms are large and the bedroom is small the passage between the bed and the closet facing it is very narrow the issue was that the bed stands are made of solid wood and are on the edge of the bed one time when i was walking and about to enter this passage my left foot toe hit the solid wood so hard it was bruised very badly and i could not walk comfortably for two weeks
