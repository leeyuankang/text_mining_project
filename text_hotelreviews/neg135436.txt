the hotel is really old fashion looks like s lobby is very dark checkin time was minutes for only customers in front of me a business guy came late and passed in front of everybody else thanks to his premium membership this is offensive and makes you non premium member feel miserable the room was okish but the decoration is old looking and dark the table is full of bumps and glitches the mini bar was empty the airco blowing noise and cold i could reduce a bit the fan but not switch it off so the next morning i had a headache the restaurant is in the huge lobby quite dark and not cosy at all so i went across the street to the trattoria bellagio last but not least the wifi was free but useless as the speed was near to none i turned back to my overall the experience was far below expectations and not reaching the level hyatt regency deserves
