bad rooms paint falling off bad furnishing as always you come back after all days work and room is not even made up then you call three times and wait hours to get a room clean at a hyatt property where you have paid ruros plus a night forget about asking anything from house keeping etc wont come till you have to leave for work etc concierge is knowledeable though and will make your reservations at very nice places for dinner or drinks all an all cant believe hyatt is putting its name on this property
