the concierge told incorrect info about currency exchange options and in general was not pleasant to deal with he really should be replaced be aware that an exchange bureau with a good rate is right in the same complex as the hotel at the minus floor don t use either the hotel or the bureaus on champs elisee they will rob a mark up from you my shower was half broken and i had to repair it every other time i took it but decided not to ask for another room my colleague asked to change her room twice due to some problems but the hotel is currently undergoing rennovation hopefully they will fix those problems
