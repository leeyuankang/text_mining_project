all sounds from the corridor could be heard in my room that is people walking and talking and closing doors and sound from the elevators i did not try to find out whether the sound came through the door with the canals in the air ventilation or maybe somehow else there was lot of noise from drilling machines and some other instruments from ten o clock in the morning but i realize that repairing work must sometimes been done so this is maybe the best time to start in the morning
