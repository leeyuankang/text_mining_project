the first night we were allocated a room which were very uncomfortable dirty and outdated when i complained the second morning we were moved to a room in the renovated section room however find the photos i attached from this room it show how bad the standard is even after renovation also it is impossible to be in the room between am and pm as a constant thundering drilling and hammering non stop as other sections of the hotel get renovated
