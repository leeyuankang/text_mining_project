our room was very run down and old the only good thing was the view until the renovations are done it s an expensive outlay without the quality you would expect of the hyatt not the hotel s fault exactly but the taxi cab that they had for us didn t take card but no one told us until we had reached the location had no cash and ended up locked in the cab at a standoff until we convinced the driver to take us to an atm to get money out frustrating so the lesson is don t assume re paying by card
