i stayed two weeks in the hotel lifts were a horror only few of them working always crowded and you never know whether they take you up or down i was taking stairs instead living on the fourth floor but i can t imagine those staying on the ninth floor to do it a hotel is a bit worn out some refreshment of furniture and renovation would be welcomed horrible toilettes that were splashing out water even with the closed cover i had problems with getting hot water few times there was only cold water running down the shower
