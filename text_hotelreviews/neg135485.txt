everything else this hotel should not be called a hyatt it ruins the brand s reputation everything is extremely old minuscule room old carpets decoration bathroom plugs do not work it even smells bad very noisy construction work going on from to i guess they are at least trying to resolve the old age issue they should not sell the rooms right next to the construction work but mine was right under i also found the staff to be mostly rude and not understanding as for some unforeseen reasons i could not make it on my planned night and asked them to modify the reservation to either reimburse or postpone to the day after or a later time within the same month all of these options were refused actually booking com asked the hotel themselves and were shocked by the lack of professionalism and customer service provided by hyatt etoile i ended up paying double the price on another day to stay in a hotel which in my opinion is no better than a stars my original fare was good enough that it would have only been a disappointing trip but the price i ended up paying and the general attitude of the staff i had to deal with makes this hotel a complete joke booking a hyatt anywhere in the world is usually a safe bet in terms of facilities as well as general service provided hyatt paris etoile is the exception
