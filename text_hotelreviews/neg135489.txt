the hotel itself is extremely tired i stayed twice over a two week period for work so saw several rooms i changed because the first room was so noisy there was building work something that i hadn t been informed about in all rooms i saw there was paint peeling from walls and windows old furnishing with marks it was clean but this gave the overall impression it wasn t and that you didn t really want to touch anything however the bathrooms seemed to be of much higher quality than the rooms themselves in addition although the staff were always friendly polite and eager to help sometimes service was a little slow i called to ask for the room to be cleaned which it was but they didn t remove the room service plates or restock the soft drinks in the minibar requested an iron which they said would be sent immediately but it took several hours and i d already left by then for me the gym is really important when travelling the claim was to have a state of the art gym however there was limited equipment the rower didn t work properly and one of the two running machines didn t work there were also no weights or resistance machines at all only cardio given a choice next time i wouldn t stay here again
