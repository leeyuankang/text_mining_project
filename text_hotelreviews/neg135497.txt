i felt like for the money that i spent at the place i could have gotten a better deal somewhere else this hotel did not have a pool the gym was pretty crappy and only contained cardio equipment our room did not have a view of the tower i felt that the breakfast options the club and the lounge are extremely overpriced options overall i feel like there are much better deals in paris where you can get more for your money
