check out took forever we were checked out by someone named tina i believe and it took just over minutes we felt negatively questioned and unhappy with this delay the room was prepaid and we had a room service charge city tax left to pay it didn t need to take this long there was no queue and when we indicated that we were in a rush it did not change anything we are extremely frequent travellers and this was the absolute longest list of questions we have ever received at check out i don t need to be asked times if i left stuff in my room she asked loads of questions about our room yet we weren t actually asked by her what card we wanted to pay she processed the payment on my credit card without asking first but because it took so long we ignored this to get out on time which was not the method of payment we actually wished to pay with this was not in line with the rest of our stay which was pleasant professional and a lot of fun i am returning in weeks time and hope this part has improved by then
