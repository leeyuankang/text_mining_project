the hotel was under renovation until some floors are even closed when booking our room online from montreal canada there was absolutely no mention of the renovations at all we had to evacuate our room early in the morning due to the unbearable noise really unbearable when i addressed the issue with the reception i was told that the entire hotel was under reno and they could not stop the contract to accommodate us in other words my contractual agreement to have a reasonable quiet room was irrelevant i thought that the answer provided by isabelle guest relations was silly and inconsiderate to say the least i would not recommend this hotel until the toni s are done
