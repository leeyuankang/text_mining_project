there s a renovation in the hotel every day from to makes a lot of noise we can t sleep or take any rest you have to be out until its done also i didn t like the breakfast lack of varieties and expensive and i was staying in the last floor very close to the night club i couldn t sleep every day from the music so loud so at the daytime renovation at night the night club perfect stay indeed
