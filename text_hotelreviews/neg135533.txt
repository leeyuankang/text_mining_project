the room was disgusting extremely tatty and small and stuffy there were renovations going on and we were told there would be a little noise between and it was like living on a building site the drilling started around whilst we were still in bed and we couldn t get out the room quick enough to escape the racket the breakfast was very average not much choice which i would of expected from a good hotel like the hyatt the panoramic bar had fantastic views and we had a lovely drink pre dinner however when we returned later it was a different experience the waiters were unfriendly and we were made to queue to go in to be seated whist in the queue the doorman let his mates through the cocktail was a short measure and tasted completely different we complained and the waiter was very snooty this hotel is obviously experiencing great problems
