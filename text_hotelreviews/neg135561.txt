the room was on the floor there was renovations going on which i was not told about when booking the noise levels were unbearable and could not rest during the day the bathroom had a constant running water sound and the aircon could not adjust the hotel did offer to move me to another room on the second floor but it had no view and it was not a smoking room that was not what i paid for
