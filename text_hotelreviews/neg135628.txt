thought that for the price there should have been tea coffe kettle in the room expected the room to be more spacious we had to complain about the shower water temperature extreme hot and extreme cold the staff gave us a more deluxe room on a lower floor the shower was better there we were satisfied however the staff said they knew about the issue so i don t think the hotel should be offering rooms at these prices when they know there is a problem with basic water temperature in our first room there was only one robe and slipper for two people in the second room there were no robes at all
