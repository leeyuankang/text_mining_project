we liked nothing staff was ill mannered response to calls was extremely poor as every time we had to call at least two to three time even to get a smaller things check in and check out both were extremely pathetic as every time you had to stand in the queue at least minutes overall in spite of our best efforts we could not find a single good thing in this hotel we had come to this hotel direct from atlantis dubai and then from hilton venice as compared to both of above hotels your hotel was at worst position having no comparison at all and extremely incompatible as far as value for money is concerned
