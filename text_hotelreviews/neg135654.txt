the property has not been renovated for few years now it was highly disappointing as per hyatt standards entering the room the paint was peeled off on one of the walls rooms are shabbily decorated with very old furniture the staff also accepted the same price was charged as per hyatt standards the roim also lacked basic amenities the window latch was broken the overall feel was that of a very old property which needs renovation
