not good value for money the room was not exactly spacious the air conditioning was very weak the shower went from scalding hot to ice cold in a hearbeat without moving the temp control the bidet blocked continuously the tv remote was missing on arrival there were only two small pillows provided although we did recieve two more on request the decor was dated and in need of refurbishment the easy chair only one of them in a double room was stained no stationery provided on the day of departure room service knocked our door continuously from around ten am onwards although we didn t have to vacate until noon all in all not the kind of things you would expect from a four star hotel
