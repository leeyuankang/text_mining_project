i booked through booking and i thought what i will get is exactly like the picture i saw online unfortunately the room was super old and smelly and the carpet was dirty when i asked they told me the hotel is under renovation and some rooms are already renovated and the ones i was checked in are the old ones i will never trust the picture put on booking it is misleading and unfair
