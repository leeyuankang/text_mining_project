the service from the kitchen minute wait for a minute steak in ciabatti really little things on customer relations really like getting the attention of the staff in bar for table service more interested in bar service than serving tables also after meal they don t ask if you would like anything else or a coffee you could be making more money and leaving the customer feeling like they have been attended to rather than serviced the breakfast buffet was almost plastic in its appearance a little chopped parsley on top of the scrambled eggs would be nice and well the poached eggs looked like a frizbee and tasted pretty much the same staff setting up and cleaning tables next to you in the rush to get ready for lunch takes away from a leisurely breakfast experience
