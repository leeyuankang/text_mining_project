i had two stays in novotel west london in the past weeks days in general my staying was very disappointing the main problem was the noise from the construction site next door starting at finishing at monday to saturday it was really annoying to get awaken by construction machines every day other nuisances there were not enough power outlets only in one side of the bed and no usb ones one of the rooms i stayed had only tv channels other one had you need to re log into the wifi network every day which was annoying and unnecessary toiletries were not consistently provided we went days and days with no bar soap or moisturiser room temperature was not pleasant we had to open the windows to have some cool air into the room breakfast for pounds was crazy last year i stayed at hilton kensington and i think it was much better value
