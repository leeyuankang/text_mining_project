as with previous reviews i encountered and smelled a member of staff who smoked compulsively he was smoking outside when i arrived for the first three days every time i went in the lift from the fourth floor he entered the lift at the second floor in order to smoke outside the lift smelled of stale cigarette smoke he smelled of smoke and i was only glad that the windows in my room did not open above his smoking position to the manager please ask your staff member to smoke further away from the hotel
