our only disappointment was that our toilet blocked in the afternoon and although we reported it at when we returned just before midnight it hadn t been addressed i asked reception who said it they couldn t sort it and we would have to use the toilet on the lower ground floor we were floor overnight a solution but not what we would expect at the rate we paid for the room shame that this left a negative impression on an otherwise lovely stay
