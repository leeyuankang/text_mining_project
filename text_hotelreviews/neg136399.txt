the breakfast staff were extremely understaffed one member completely ignored me when i asked for a glass for juice i waited for minutes until they brought glasses the coffee machine needs clearer instructions on how to use it after attempts i gave up and had hot chocolate instead i saw others struggling with it too the bathroom shower was very cheaply made however it had good water pressure so it didn t bother me too much i requested a room with a bath but only got a shower i wouldn t have mind so much had the receptionist at least acknowledged my request and that particular receptionist was quite unwelcoming when i checked in
