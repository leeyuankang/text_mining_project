the approach to the hotel is dark and potentially dangerous when wet and without lighting there were street lamps on the walkway but they were never lit there was also a lot of rubbish around which i feel a good hotel would have taken responsibility for cleaning the worst part room filled the jug on the espresso machine from the bathroom tap it came out bright green soapy with bits floating in it it also had a sewage smell not nice to brush your teeth in reported to reception twice after it was still smelling horrible the next morning they said they would report it and get back to me by email which hasn t happened i kept a sample of the water in case we became ill very disappointing service for the price
