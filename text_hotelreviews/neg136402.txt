not sure why but in the morning for breakfast they wanted us to eat in what resembled a meeting room very dark and boring yet across the way was a bright and modern eating area with access to an outside courtyard we refused to eat in the boardroom and enjoyed the outside courtyard first bedroom was ok but clear it was aimed at business people but due to an issue with no aircon we were moved to a room on floor which was very nice
