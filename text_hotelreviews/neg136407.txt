first two days were ok however on the third day our anniversary the whole purpose of our trip when we returned to our room during the afternoon we found that the bedding had been stripped all the towels removed and just left in a mess this greatly upset us as we had planned to go out for a celebratory meal and wanted to relax and get ready for the evening we couldn t actually get back into our room until after this was after we had a conversation with the hotel management and no attempt was made to give our room priority and we were still guests it was almost as if they had thought we had checked out response was totally unsatisfactory and no real explanation given struggled to get tea bags daily in our room plus the fact that there was no smoke alarm and paper cups provided for hot drinks totally unsuitable this left a sour taste and rather spoilt our special day we know mistakes do happen but what upset us most was that there was no sense of urgency in resolving our problem and we had to de camp to the lounge area for over an hour with a token gesture for two free drinks
