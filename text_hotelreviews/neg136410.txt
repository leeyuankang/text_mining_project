the reception area of the hotel is very confusing there is no sign to indicate what area of the reception desk is for check in or check out there is not a clear queuing system and other guests just walk in and get served before those that have been waiting in line we had to wait over minutes before being attended to this would have been longer had a member of staff not decided to call us over to check us in before a guest who had just walked in off the street i mentioned this poor queuing system to the reception staff and they acknowledged this was an ongoing issue
