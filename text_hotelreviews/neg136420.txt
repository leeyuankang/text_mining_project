the bed in our first room was thin and rock hard our first two nights we slept very badly i reluctantly complained and the customer service was excellent upgrading us to a nicer room for our final night however despite the beautiful room the mattress was pretty much the same and still very hard and uncomfortable a shame really as the hotel itself is awesome
