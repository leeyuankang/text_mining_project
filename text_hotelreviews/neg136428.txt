hotel overheated bed not comfortable too hard breakfast low quality scrambled eggs had a green tinge and smelt off bacon greasy congealed scraps dining room furniture shabby and carpet old and dirty staff hard pressed and some seemed unhappy with their jobs i do not like the way french chain hotels vary their tariff almost daily creates a sense of exploitation we stayed a total of consecutive days adding days to an initial booking of yet the posted price changed to a lower price on our additional day after we had booked and payed in advance at the higher price these sorts of price games are not fair
