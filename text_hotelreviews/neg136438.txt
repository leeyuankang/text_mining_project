the staff was horrible unprofessional unsympathetic unkind unpolished unaware we myself and my group of clients booked our rooms on booking com when the rate was better than the rates for existing reservations made directly through the hotel i booked with booking com and canceled the other at arrival the staff said there were no reservations and refused to look for the booking com reservations they would not allow my travel clients to check in after several hours of flight from the u s and were very rude to them the staff even gave my clients an e mail my office sent them which should have been internal information that should not have been forwarded to any client this email clearly outlined the reservation that were canceled it had the reservation numbers as well the staff didn t bother to look for the valid reservations and showed no care about the plight my clients faced especially since i was delayed all they had to do was take a few extra minutes to look in their system my flight was delayed but i had a layover in istanbul i called and spoke with the front desk staff gave them the confirmation numbers given by booking com but the staff refused to listen i had to speak with several people incur high phone charges and even raise my voice to force someone to listen to me my client placed me on the phone with receptionist she again reiterated the reservations were canceled i advised her of the valid confirmation number she ignored me repeatedly simply repeating the reservations were canceled i had to literally raise my voice to force her to look up the confirmation number she then said oh i found it but this was after she continued to be rude and unprofessional forcing me in desperation to raise my voice with her it was very frustrating and my clients were very effected by the lack of professionalism and empathy they were shown each day was an issue
