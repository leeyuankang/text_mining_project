arrived to find the room we booked was not available needed adjacent rooms given we had adults and children hotel staff sent us to different rooms that weren t adjacent and then finally the try was a success this took over an hour and everyone was really tired and frustrated no apology for the hassle from the hotel after asking if we could get a complimentary breakfast for the inconvenience there was little interest in anything of that kind beds were uncomfortable rooms were not serviced we were there for nights got a refill on the minibar water and soda only upon request correct price was not captured at checkout overall not a good experience i m sure under the right circumstances this could have been a good experience and staff going the extra mile to make us happy with our choice would have made the world of difference but they made no such attempts we certainly won t be coming back
