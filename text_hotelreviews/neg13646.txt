the only little niggle was when we got back to the hotel at we ordered drinks at the bar and then asked for food people around us were eating and the barman told us it was getting busy and to go over to the restaurant to eat we waited for our drinks and headed over to the restaurant which was closed we have a feeling that he was trying to avoid having to work later than possible which we do understand but thought a little cheeky it didn t spoil our stay though
