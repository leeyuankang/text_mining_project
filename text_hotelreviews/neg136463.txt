the maids didn t clean the room well each day leaving rubbish bins full and pillows or towels on the floor when we called room service twice we were told we had to go from the floor to the first to collect our order ourselves we were told we were not allowed to have larger glasses for drinking water as they were for the bar but if we wanted to order room service i e coke or a cocktail they could provide the larger glass once leaving we requested a taxi be called we then got it the taxi outside the hotel only to have another taxi block us of and abuse our current driver to which hotel staff then joined the argument over the fare rather than resolving the issue the pillows and towels where also very small and the toilet very cramped and without and exhaust fan the air conditioning in the room also did not work well resulting in hot and smelly nights very dissatisfied customers we stayed for both business and leisure
