power cut for a few hours one morning not notified only told when we phoned and asked therefore no hot water either so wasted half day waiting for a shower no free drink voucher or the like for the inconvenience asked for extra pillows never arrived apparently i d booked wrong check out date saturday instead of sunday even though on check in the receptionist informed me i could arrange late check out on sunday if i needed it and so asked to book a further night was told that they had no rooms and i had half an hour to get my bags asked for her help but she was completely unhelpful bordering on rude and said well we have no rooms here no suggestions for other hotels in the area etc would not use again or recommend
