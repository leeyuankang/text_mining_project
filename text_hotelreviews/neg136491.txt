we were put in the overflow room for breakfast the first morning where everything seemed to be a lower quality tinned fruit not fresh paper cups not china no cutlery initially fewer selection of breads no nespresso coffee machine very disappointing especially as that morning was our first wedding anniversary morning the key cards to the room only ever worked twice and had to be therefore constantly reset was slightly disappointed at paper cups in bedrooms for hot drinks especially in a privilege room
