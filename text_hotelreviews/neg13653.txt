the food breakfast is fine but the room service dinner i had was very disappointing and room services is never cheap working away and long hours i didn t get to eat until about receiving a burnt bottomed rock hard pizza with poor flavours is not what you need after a long travel day i couldn t finish it so for me it was a waste of money
