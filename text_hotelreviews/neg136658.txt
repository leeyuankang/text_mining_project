breakfast the breakfast was disorganized with a poor selection of food on the first day we arrived at and there was literally no food left despite us being told breakfast was served until room despite our request to be in a room that was all on one level it was stated in the booking form they gave us a duplex room which really spoiled the holiday as we were traveling with a year old who could not sleep downstairs by herself therefore our daughter had to sleep on a mattress on the floor not what i would expect when pay euros a night also there was only one tiny ac unit covering two floors which meant the room was really hot at night construction works our room faced a building undergoing construction so not only was the view ruined but we were woken early each morning with loud banging and shouting
