there was little relaxation space the garden in the pictures was only accessible from four rooms the living room was busy with strangers needing to sit next to other strangers not relaxing the rooms were tiny i was in a superior so not the smallest and we had to move the chair every time we wanted to open a wardrobe door there was no sink in the toilet so you had to open two doors before you could wash your hands
