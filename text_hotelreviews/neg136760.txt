now i only stayed ther for one night with that in mind here is my review the spa area was well not a spa the pool was tiny meeters long i could be wrong and the hot room as well as the shower in the spa area smelled like mold the only thing i wanted to do after going into this facility for a brief time was to wash up when i talked to the assistant about it he asked me if an other user maybe caused the smell to which i still roll my eyes the next day the pool was not working so i could not check the bathroom at the room had a wet smell to it as well that was fixed the momnet i opened the windows so taking into consideration the age of buildings in paris that was not a big problem when i arrived i got informed that they did not have big towels in my room so i should try to manage when i asked to use one of the bathrobes from the spa the assistant said ok when i arrived i was informed that checkout was at and if i was any late i would be charged euro per hour also if i was to smoke even though i stated that i am not a smoker the above i had to sign in an agreement something that i found very unsettling since it would be hard to proove i did not smoke after i left the room and the country i was also informed of the possibility to get a breakfast in the room the assistant felt complied to add that the euro breakfast i payed for the next morning because it is in the room we can not bring everything i informed her i will not use this service overall the breakfast was nice the only thing i found challenging was to find where the plates and cutlery where kept since they were behind a bar and there was no personnel in the room to seek help from
