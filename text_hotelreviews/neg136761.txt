they need to remove the work spa from their name three times i tried to use the pool or steam room and three times it was closed for cleaning maintenance the first occasion this occured was around on friday we had explored paris and had looked forward to a steam and a swim neither were operational i spoke to the reception who made excuses that the pool was being cleaned i felt that the pool should be cleaned outside of its published opening hours of to and not at times when guests are told it can be used the same situation on the saturday late afternoon with neither of the spa facilities being available to use to top it all off monday morning the same thing yet again when we book our accommodation and search out and pay a premium for extra facilities like a spa then we certainly expect to use them and get value from them overall it was very disappointing that every time we wished to use the spa is was not available
