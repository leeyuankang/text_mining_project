i booked the place mainly for the pool recommended by the doctor to exercise prior to a knee surgery upon arrival i was informed the pool has degrees and expected to have had this information at booking moment the person at reception was polite yet i felt a forced politeness when talking about the subject blamed booking com for this lack of information as he mentioned it was sent to booking com not bathrobe and sleepers in the room in a spa hotel they had and required one in the room yet i was told to go down at spa to take them no trouble whatsoever but expected them to bring them in the room at a stars service a simple change of attitude could increase the ratings of the overall experience
