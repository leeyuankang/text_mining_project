this is an excellent hotel but a few minor things would make things a lot better first a little bit more storage space maybe a few shelves for clothes etc second providing facility for making coffee in room would be good maybe a hot water maker and coffee sachet breakfast did not start till and the day we left we had to leave for the airport early and none of the cafes has opened so no coffee before we left finally a clock in the room would be useful
