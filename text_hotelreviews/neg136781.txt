the night staff were awful well one of them in particular at one stage we were kept waiting minutes outside at night the room had a very musty pungent smell about it similar to burnt cannabis we thought it was just our room but generally the whole floor smelt of it on two of the days the cleaners failed to leave bath towels and when requested from the night staff we ended up having to go downstairs ti get them on the whole mediocre hotel definitely not star terrible night person would not stay there again
