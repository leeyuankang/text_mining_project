the front desk staff was not welcoming upon arrival but paled in comparison to the rudeness of the front desk reception upon departure the room was not made up during our stay although it appeared at some point a staff member entered the room to leave a madeline which i assumed was part of the turn down service they did not attempt at any other housekeeping interestingly the first night there was no turn down service at all which would have gone unnoticed had the mystery cookie not appeared upon check out the receptionist insisted we wait in a long line at the desk pay the city tax although we showed her proof that it was already paid on booking com also the room was extremely small having stayed in paris quite frequently in a range of hotels this was definitely the smallest room i have ever seen
