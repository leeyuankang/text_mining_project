this isn t a great location for sightseeing it s close to the eiffel tower but the other main sights and the centre of the city are a metro ride away and as the metro isn t particularly well designed very long walks to change lines for example this is time consuming we chose this location deliberately though because we were attending concerts at radio france next door and it was convenient for the parc des princes too also it s quite noisy as the hotel is at the junction of major roads and the pont de grenelle and the french toot their horns indiscriminately no tea and coffee making facilities in the room
