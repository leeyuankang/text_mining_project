we had two problems which were on arrival i had pre arranged a transfer from the airport to the hotel with the hotel and when we arrived the driver was not there we waited an hour and a half and contacted the hotel when in the end they said he wasn t coming and we had to organise our own taxi they said their driver was usually reliable but not this time i had also pre arranged for the hotel to book our lunch at a cafe for christmas and when i checked that also hadn t been done but they did it once i checked so probably have to keep ensuring they do what you ask even though i had sent emails and received confirmation of the arrangements i had asked for the staff were apologetic and were very helpful with other things during our stay and organised the taxi on our return journey to the airport
