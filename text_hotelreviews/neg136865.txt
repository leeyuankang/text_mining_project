the location is good because it s quiet but it also means that it is a little walk to go to almost all restaurants that s fine use uber you can walk to some museums and eiffel tower and a few other things but if you want a happening nightlife look at latin quarter bastille montmarte i would choose this place though and just uber there like i did
