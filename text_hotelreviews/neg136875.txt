tiny room which was actually a converted corridor on the top floor ceiling in bathroom too low unable to shower comfortably breakfast was haphazard two girls were working but cutlery and food not replenished asked for change of room but told this would not be possible no explanation given this was part of my wife s birthday celebrations and i asked via booking com that this might be acknowledged by the hotel despite being told the hotel had acknowledged this on arrival given terrible room and not even a flower in the room sauna wasn t working for the duration of the stay despite being included in the overall cost no remuneration offered it may have been different outcome if we hadn t booked through booking com and instead booked direct with the hotel i won t be using this site again unfortunately we may have just encountered the hotel on a bad day or four but in the context of expectations of the hotel it was a massive disappointment
