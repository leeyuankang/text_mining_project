at check in i was asked if i had stayed at the hotel before the receptionist then went into a back room for a very long time and i was left standing at the desk when she returned i was asked if i had any outstanding balance to pay from my last visit which i did not i was made to feel very uncomfortable by the delay and felt as if i was being accused of something underhand
