i think due to the location this hotel thinks that service is second when it should be first each time i stay here it becomes worst in terms of service the housekeeping and porters are nice the restaurant members dont look like they want to be bothered however the front desk and concierge people could not be any more rude as a spg gold member i expect more overall this is the worst service i have ever had in paris
