we were a little cold the first night as the bedding was quite light and there wasn t an extra in the wardrobe we turned on the heating and asked for an extra blanket for the night and we were toasty tv remote didn t work very well frustrating at times but i m sure if we d raised it as an issue it would have been rectified we were in and out a lot so didn t bother
