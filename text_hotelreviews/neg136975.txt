very tired and dated property in a grand building from the dirty wood behind reception to the scruffy false grass in the courtyard and corridors that smelt like an old one star hotel the glass tables in the old fashioned restaurant are so scratched they should have been replaced years ago but i suppose for a vendome hotel the price is towards the lower end
