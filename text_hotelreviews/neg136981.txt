rude and non organized staff at the breakfast we had to queue in the morning to get the breakfast while table were empty the excuse given is the following you need to wait until we clean them and it is taking time because we do not have enough staff to do it not what do you expect from a hotel at eur night room is small to be fair i knew that and it is not an issue for me the big issue is that it was full of dust complained about it to the reception most outrageous thing that happened during my stay was at the lobby we asked for some water and a diet coke the staff apologized saying that the hotel policy is to not serve drinks food in the lobby i was fine with that until minutes later when a famous ceo arrived with his staff and been served all the drinks and food he wanted complained about it and even took a picture they did not care to reply i am not a millionaire but i expect to be treated as any other customer
