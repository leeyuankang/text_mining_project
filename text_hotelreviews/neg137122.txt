there was no storage for clothes in drawers only limited room in a closet to accommodate clothes you might hang up this would be ok for a one night stay but no longer we had to live out of our suitcases also the shower consisted of a hand held fixture attached to the bath tub which one had to hold up over their head to wash off the soap etc there was no shower curtain or any way to keep from splashing water on to the floor
