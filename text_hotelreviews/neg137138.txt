external noise from bars and restaurants in street below ok if you keep windows shut and use ac otherwise definitely a problem no parking on site despite it saying so on booking com you have to use party parking at euro for hours very small feel to the hotel almost as if you are entering an apartment block and not an hotel very poor that restaurant was shut for dinner without prior notification and because the telegraph had recommended it so highly it is tiny however and the food would have to be really good to make up for the lack of space breakfast looked like a buffet a good b b would serve up rather disappointing experience given rooms are average in terms of decor etc and nothing really exceeds your expectations and you hope for nothing going wrong
