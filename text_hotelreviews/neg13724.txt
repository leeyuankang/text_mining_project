dreadful awful directions really infuriating impossible to work out where the residents car park is when you arrive just looks like a normal paying car park and it is not clear that it is for residents once the car was unloaded we headed to the signs for reception and the lift but the lift was not working and the sign saying use alternative stairs lift points to a wall it took ages to find stairs as there are no signs we found some stairs and then we had to walk up numerous flights with all our luggage awful start to our stay breakfast the staff that cleared away the tables need to be more courteous the lady who cleared the table as we were shown to our seat seemed very unhappy and did not want to be there then when i had finished eating but my husband was still half way through a cooked breakfast a waiter came and cleared everything away apart from his plate and knife and fork teapot side plate cups and glasses everything he was still eating very rude i also don t want to see a manager stood there with her arms folded looking everyone up and down as they pass through very unprofessional and then give a member of staff a dressing down in front of everyone if you have an issue with a staff member take it out the back please when checking out there were no signs showing how to get to the car park wandered aimlessly for a good few minutes the reception bar area has signs for everything except the car park and we had no idea where we came in so frustrating in the end we had to ask sign your hotel better novotel i stay in hotels all over the world regularly and this was a poor show
