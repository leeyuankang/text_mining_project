hotel looks great in photos but please note eg marble bathrooms are tiled not real marble many fittings look good but are poor quality don t work properly shower door banging into rainfall shower head when opened etc our rooms were stiflingly hot and we asked for them to be checked while we were at dinner the charming receptionist forgot to do that and when we returned we were given completely the wrong information about the in room heating system so we all had a very uncomfortable night with young children staff the following morning were aware of the problem but not particularly interested
