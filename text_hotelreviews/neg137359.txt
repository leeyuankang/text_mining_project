the hotel says it has parking however the car park is not linked to the hotel and is about a minute walk away it s about euros to park your car there overnight so if you are thinking of driving to and leaving your car there it could end up being quite costly there is on street parking but maximum stay is hours and costs euros it is free to park from to overnight on street parking if you are looking for somewhere quiet then be warned there are bars below and it is very lively at night we were on the top floor and although not extremely noisy you can hear people cars outside this didn t bother us as we were so tired after such a long day anyway if you have a lot of hair bring your own hair dryer as the one s provided aren t the most powerful usual hotel travel dryers
