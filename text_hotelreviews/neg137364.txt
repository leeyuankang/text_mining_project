hotel is rated as star but it does not deserve even stars tiny elevator where a medium size bag can be bared pushed in air conditioning was not operating every day the staff promised to fix it but nothing happened finally upon check out they revealed that it is a policy of the hotel during this season not to use air conditioning without air conditioning it is impossible to stay in room windows should be opened but this is a very noisy neighbourhood of montmartre moulin rouge is aroud the corner so all night long you can hear screems shouts songs etc from the street not easy to fall asleep room was so tiny two midsize bags could not be opened simulatneously no space for anything one should be careful for toes not to crash them against bag or the bad or the door bathroom was tiny although two showers were for some reason a mixer for the flexible shower did not work only cold water was flowing double bed was so small that despite my gf and i are very sportive persons and do not need much space we were almost at the edge all the time corridors were stuffy
