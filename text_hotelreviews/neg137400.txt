broken tiles in the bathroom noted this was room not fixed when i walked over with damp or wet feet the cracked pieces lifted and i almost cut myself on a few pieces i had to put them back in place all the time a bit noisy at night but that is the area but it s not to bad it s a hit city after all small rooms for the price we paid ok but we would not pay the average normal price
