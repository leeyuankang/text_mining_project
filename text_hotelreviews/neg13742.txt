the fact that we had to pay per hour for parking after paying per night to stay in the hotel was shocking and also our power went off whilst we were getting ready in the morning and the staff didn t seem bothered lastly a charge was added to the bill incase we used room service which we wasn t told about luckily we didn t have to pay this at the end
