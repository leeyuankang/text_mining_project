apart from having somebody bringing your luggage into your room i didn t see any difference with a star hotel it was great to have a kettle in the room but the choice of tea coffee was very reduced either basic black tea or instant coffee not great when you are off caffeine the bathroom was very dated with damaged walls in the shower area i am glad i had a discount as i would have be disappointed to have to pay full price
