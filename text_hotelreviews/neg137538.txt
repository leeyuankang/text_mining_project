the hotel does not have a lot of common space at reception and the bar is more of a quiet space to have an evening drink after a long day exploring if you are looking for a lively on site venue this is not it however there are plenty of cafes restaurants and other venues within min from the door step of the hotel so this should not be considered a problem
