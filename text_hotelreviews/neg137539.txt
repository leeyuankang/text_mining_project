the hotel is clean and cared for but i think it got its stars a while ago and some areas such as the bathrooms could do with up dating and where the carpets have been replaced on the stairs you can see the edges of the carpet rather than them being finished off i had a problem when checking in due to my credit card having been replaced month before while a resolution was found it meant i had to have a refund then pay again for the room this led to unnecessary bank charges as my passport was evidence i was the same person as the credit card this all became far too much of an issue which was a shame as it impacted my view of the hotel that said i would definitely go back when i go to paris next year
