staff specially the receptionist miss dolma is amazing and really professional in being rude and providing assistance to its customer the property is rather very much into making money other than putting customer s satisfaction as their priority for assistance i did call boooking com hotline but there is no one to assist during night your call be go on waiting for next one hour my main concern has been with booking com then the property directly let me tell you i have been very very active booking com customer but am really disappointed with them
