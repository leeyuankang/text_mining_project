the hotel looks very worn and tired am unclear how it managed a star rating it is also very noisy in the rooms at night due to traffic whizzing up and down the main road that is close by i was on the top floor there is no sound proofing this is a functional hotel no more good location for work close by with a super boulangerie around the corner great staff for the rest pretty dreadful for the money
