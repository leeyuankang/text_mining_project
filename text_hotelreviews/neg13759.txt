when we walked into the hotel there was no reception desk it was up another floor and no one helped us to find the reception floor even though staff were around it was a rather business hotel which did make us feel slightly uncomfortable as the staff didn t help us as much as we weren t clients or there for meetings everyone should be treated individually it wasn t only us staying there who felt this way the breakfast was also at a ridiculous price
