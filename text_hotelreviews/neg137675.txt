since it was my third time staying here i was surprised that i was initially placed in a tiny room facing a wall with no space i had expected to have a similar room from previous times which has a balcony and faces the street i requested to be moved to the room that i was familiar with which they did definitely the first room was not worthy the charges and or did not meet the stars standards just fyi
