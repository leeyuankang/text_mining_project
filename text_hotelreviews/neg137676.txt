there are no tea coffee making facilities in the room which was surprising it is a little dated but has a certain charm to it i would suggest re grouting the bathrooms the hairdryer was woeful gives you about second bursts unfortunately one of the towels was very stained we didn t have the breakfast but from what i could see it was in a dark room and quite costly there are lots of little cafes in the area serving breakfasts use those instead
