the bar was empty during the evening and food could only be served to my room if i was there for leisure i don t think i would like this its nice to sit in a lively bar or restaurant the evening reception staff did not know much about the food when i asked about one or two dishes and suggested i went to the restaurant down the road because this is where the food comes from anyway i was really glad i did go to the restaurant rather than eating in my room however it would be nice if staff could be more knowledgeable on the menu
