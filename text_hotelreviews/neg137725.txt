breakfast was very poor i read some reviews saying it was good but most things ware bought at the supermarket and of very low quality there was no fresh fruit or juice sausages and cold cuts were terrible very few options compared to most continental breakfasts the lady working at the breakfast was not paying any attention to the buffet or to customers so we found ourselves without glasses or cups and had to ask as well for more food to be taken to the buffet she sounded even a little bit frustrated by that i think waiters should watch the room more closely and ensure everything is always available to customers and customers are happy about the service
