breakfast was painful and really of poor quality there are only few tables available in a very tiny reception area room for all customers the staff allocated to the breakfast is extremely slow and have no common sense the quality of the products are very low and the staff is warming up the scrumbled eggs coming from a package behind the bar in a microwave nothing is fresh everything comes from a package stars hotel with all the brasseries around champs elisee area it s better to go out if you really want to enjoy your breakfast
