false advertising which said the room was soundproof that s why i decided to pay extra to stay here it was a complete lie the walls were paper thin a woman next door was drunk and ranted and yelled at her boyfriend for hours then she started throwing things i complained to the concierge a couple of times finally he came up and tapped gently on the disruptive woman s door she didn t answer and he left without talking to her fortunately she quieted down around a m probably because the alcohol put her to sleep the concierge still should ve talked to her to discourage such behavior in the future the next morning a different concierge double charged me for the room instead of simply adding breakfast to my bill he also added the cost of my room and insisted this new total would replace the old total i was skeptical i said the bank had no way of knowing how many nights i stayed he acted condescending in the stereotypical parisian way as if i was an idiot who didn t understand the nuances of banking well i was charged for two nights and it took multiple calls to the hotel and my bank to straighten it out incompetence and rudeness is a combination that s hard to forgive
