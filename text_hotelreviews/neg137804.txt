location is not the best for tourism weirdly the toilet was too high i am and my toes just touch the ground the sliding door to the bathroom is very heavy and hard to open and close and although the sink tub shower hardware is beautiful it is difficult to use if hands are wet or have lotion on and lastly the tub is so big you cannot lay back and relax without sliding down under the water unless you are a good tall
