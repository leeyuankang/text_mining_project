if you want to sleep peacefully forget about that place they play music all night long very loudly with stupidly loud bass which resonates in the room could not sleep all night and it lasted until beyond when we had to wake up early the next day it s more of a night club you also have all the drunk guests from the bar who go outside to smoke and they yell when they talk and wake you up there is also a pub just opposite the hotel which compounds the nuisance the hotel staff in particular at the reception ate just arrogant almost rude
