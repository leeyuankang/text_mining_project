upon booking this trip i informed them it would be for my girlfriends birthday they agreed to provide some welcome drinks which was very kind however we never received them i also asked for a room with a nice view they said they would accommodate for that also again we didn t receive that we were given a room with no bath and a disabled shower and toilet the room was poorly decorated and very gloomy the breakfast which i paid an extra for was average at best the english muffins were stale and the full english breakfast was mostly stringy fatty pieces of bacon with no other real variety of extras also the gives you a spend per person which we fell under as our bill came to the hotel then tried to charge us for going over our allowance which wasn t possible also before informing you how breakfast works they pour you a glass of freshly squeezed out a bottle orange juice all in all this was a horrendous stay and i wouldn t recommend this hotel
