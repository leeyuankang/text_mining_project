the pillows were absolutely horrific soft scrunched up easily warmed up however if my only complaint is pillows you know it s a good stay my only other gripe is that if you are not familiar with london this is halfway around the circle line from the famous central london but the local area is well worth exploring take a side street and end up in a beautiful new part of the city
