we stayed south place hotel years ago and everything was really excellent this year especially in the restaurant the food and service did not always keep up with average service of the hotel two hamburgers ordered as medium well turned up beyond well done another incident another day we ordered an icescream scoop instead of clotted cream but got the clotted cream when we told the waiter he immediately apologized took the plate came with what we assumed was a new plate with icecream the problem was they never changed the plate just put the icecream on top of the clotted cream that is not good service
