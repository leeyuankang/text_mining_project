the hotel would have scored top marks but for the fact that i had to try ringing room service times before my call was answered usually the service especially that provided by the room service team is amazing and efficient so i will assume that i just picked a bad moment half an hour in which to try and place an order and that this was a one off i have already booked to stay again in a few weeks
