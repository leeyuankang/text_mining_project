we stayed over the weekend and on both nights the floor outdoor bar and floor restaurant were rented out for wedding thus limiting the range of facilities we were able to enjoy noise levels were a pretty major annoyance both nights we feel asleep to a thumping bass originating from the wedding parties taking place on the floor we were on the floor this went on past midnight not to be a party pooper but given that this is a star hotel surely some sort of limit on the volume of music curfew for playing loud music better soundproofing shouldn t be too much to ask for inconsistent standards of service some of the staff we encountered were completely gracious and delightful but others seemed a bit confused and poorly trained which unfortunately marred the experience for us examples include a waiter who got curt with us at breakfast when we sent back our iced coffees the kitchen put sugar in them without us asking for it and a waiter in the spies society lounge who was inexplicably reluctant to take our orders and suggested we move down to the main bar instead what is the point of setting up a floor lounge with drinks menus on the tables then special mention goes to a woman ostensibly in some kind of events coordinator role who snapped at me in a snotty voice excuse me this is a private space when i popped into the floor outdoor bar to have a look the bar was empty at the time and it was not obvious that it had been reserved for a wedding in any event her manner was completely inappropriate and made me feel like an intruder when in fact i was a paying guest of the hotel
