the residents only bars were not open either evening on our return one evening we arrived back earlier at the hotel specifically to visit the garden bar some information regarding opening times would have been useful only one of our rooms was ready on arrival we had requested early check in so were informed that the keys for the second room would be brought to us this did not happen and as we had a full itinerary on a tight schedule this resulted in part of our group checking in after not great customer service
