i had difficulty in getting the shade lowered before i went to bed it kept starting and stopping and i had to keep repressing the button it took mins to get my room dark enough to sleep it was late and i didn t really feel like reporting it i had to change rooms because my initial room was opposite a noisy building site i had asked specifically for a quiet room so was a little irritated that i had to immediately ask to be moved
