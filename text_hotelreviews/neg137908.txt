we had one of the inner rooms on the floor i had asked for a quiet room unfortunately the music from a party and from the bar was so noisy that we could not get to sleep breakfast menu seemed a bit dated a wider range buffet style with more fresh fruit and veg would have made a big difference as opposed to the tired uninspiring english breakfast choices a more sumptuous breakfast would have justified the prices and upped the hotel to another category
