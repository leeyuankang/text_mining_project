we had to wait for house keeping outside the room for over half an hour which was unfortunate the room wasn t as impressive as i was expecting considering the rate per night and therefore not entirely full value for money as there are other equivalent hotels in city that are cheaper options to similar standard also i was slapped on the head from a drunken guest at the ground floor bar and i asked the staff to maybe not serve him drinks and to escort him out not only did they let him finish his drink he also had time to harass to other young ladies before they asked him to leave which i thought was bad
