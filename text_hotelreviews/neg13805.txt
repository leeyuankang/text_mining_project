parking is extortionate to be charged at an hourly rate even when staying overnight which in my opinion is wrong when you are paying pounds per night to stay staff were obviously not too sympathetic and said as it was a weekend we could park out on the street for free this was not my preference at all had to park a few streets away which was a bit of a walk in very cold weather i think a flat rate should be charged to park overnight carpet in our room was covered in stains of all shapes and sizes apart from that it was clean enough
