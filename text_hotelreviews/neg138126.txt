breakfast is awful do not have breakfast in this hotel less than a min away you will find excellent cafe bars serving a good full english breakfast for this includes unlimited tea and coffee and beans as a standard part of a full english breakfast unlike this hotel both mornings we came down to an empty restaurant bar where breakfast is served both mornings we had to find a member of staff to clear a table so that we could sit down we ordered breakfast which as we are both gluten intolerant not by choice this is a medical condition we could not eat anything offered on the continental breakfast list however the continental choice is limited to pastries yogurt and fruit there were fruit juices on offer however no glasses to drink it out of we waited mins for glasses in order to have some fruit juice we orderd a full english breakfast and asking for beans as part of it along with gluten free toast and poached eggs and smoked salmon on day one we received nothing close to our order however as we were meeting friends in london we had no time to wait for an elusive member of staff to appear so just left hungary and thirsty as our tea arrived mins after we had ordered it on the second day we ordered toast as soon as we had cleared our own table along with a decaf tea unfortunately the member of staff did not understand that tea can be decaf and kept trying to bring us coffee which we don t drink after three trips back to the kitchen we finally got hot drinks however no toast our full english breakfast came without beans after asking twice more we both received a huge bowl of beans to go with our now half eaten breakfast still no toast finally again after asking we received toast but no butter a lovely american guest sitting next to us offered us her butter so we could at least have hot toast unfortunately our toast was hard and cold it had obviously been waiting in the kitchen for a long time
