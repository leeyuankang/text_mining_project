unfortunately the ipod docking station did not work as the cradle was broken it was looked at but wasn t fixed which was a shame as we like to have our music on when we are getting ready also lancaster gate tube station was closed which was a pain as it is mins away from the hotel and perfect for getting into london queensway was a good minute walk
