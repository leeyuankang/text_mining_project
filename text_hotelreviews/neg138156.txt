breakfast was a bit of a disaster we had to wait about minutes for our table to be cleared and re layed the range of food was limited coffee took mins to appear and the croissants were stale then to top it all we were told to eat up as the room needed to be cleared by which i thought was unacceptable due to us waiting for a table to be cleared in the first place pity as everything else was wonderful
