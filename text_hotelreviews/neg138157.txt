i didn t like that the door to the hotel room is so thin and has such a poor sound isolation you hear even the faintest whisper through it beds were not too comfy my main concern is breakfast the continental buffet has literally no proteins you ll get white bread jams honey pastries ham cheese will run you and eggs will also cost extra see my photo
