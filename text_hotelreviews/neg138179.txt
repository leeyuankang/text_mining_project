we were given the wrong room at the fault of the receptionist and then asked to move rooms after we had unpacked and were about to eat dinner in addition the booking was in my name yet the receptionist would not address look at me and kept saying sir to my partner even after i filled out registration form pretty strange and rude although we didn t move rooms in the end the hotel overall had pretty bad terrible customer service there s no security lock on the door i stay in hotels on a weekly basis for work and this is not the norm glad i wasn t a lone female traveller
