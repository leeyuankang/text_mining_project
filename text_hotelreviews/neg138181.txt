shower had no hot water i waited minutes for it to warm up but had to catch the express to heathrow so i took the fastest shower on record miserable experience room avoid this one also absence of a kettle and coffee tea in the room was a surprise i was in the uk for a week on a book tour and even the humblest hotels had a kettle would have been nice obviously management has a phobia about hot water
