the room was freezing couldn t take a shower because the bathroom was too cold i had to put my coat and cloths over the bed as there was no spare blanket the heater was useless i could not be bothered to call anyone at the time because it was gone when we went to our room it s the only thing that spoilt an otherwise good hotel
