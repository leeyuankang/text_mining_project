wifi was terribly slow i did a speed test on the network and the upload speed was this is very slow for the price of the hotel compared to other hotels in the area or compared with other hotels in the nearby and better arrondissement i don t think it was good value for the a night price when i booked the location is right next to the grands boulevards metro which is great for getting around paris although the staff was very friendly and polite i was very surprised that they do not help you with your bags upon check in a young guy helped me with my bags but upon check out i had to make separate trips to my taxi in order to get all of my bags i have been in paris for weeks as i will move here next year so i m looking at apartments during my stay i have moved around every couple of days in order to check out different arrondissements every other hotel i have stayed in during the weeks has been a star hotel that had great deals on booking com they were all cheaper or the same price as this holiday inn novotel paris les halles empire hotel and spa hotel de seze and lyric hotel have all been great hotels in awesome locations much nicer and in better areas than this holiday inn i think if it was a less expensive hotel then i would understand as i didn t have any big issues with the hotel but with booking com and all the hotel competition in paris you can definitely find better that will really make your holiday enjoyable
