kettle s cap was a bit broken not a big issue but still worth mentioning before arrival we changed a credit card since previous have expired but for some reason the hotel tried to reserve an amount from old card unsuccessfully so they cancelled the booking hopefully this case was successfully solved once we arrived to the hotel and our booking was recovered
