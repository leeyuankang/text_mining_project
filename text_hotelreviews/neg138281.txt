the bed sheet was not clean when we checked in and my wife had some insect bites and the next day we asked the hotel to change and they did need to be careful when showering in bathtub with glass door as it s bath tub is high and takes some effort to climb into and out room service did good job of cleaning the room daily and even knew when the shower gel dispenser was empty and refilled it promptly
