while recently renovated the building is quite old our room was in a remote corner of the hotel that could not be reached by elevator the staircase through which we had to go with our heavy suitcase was old and quite inconvenient i definitely did not like the location of our room facing a dark alley with construction going on and its size for the price we paid euro per night luckily we were able to find a much cheaper and nicer apartment through airbnb for the rest of our stay
