the rooms were too small and airless in my first night i stayed in a depressing room the following day i asked for a bigger and more luminous one my second room was bigger but i could touch the ceiling it was an attic definitely not the place for a claustrophobic person like me so i wouldn t define my stay in this hotel as comfortable
