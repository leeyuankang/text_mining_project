there was a huge music machine glued to the small bedside table leaving nowhere to keep glasses phone kindle etc without knocking them off there was a shelf underneath but that ment leaning right out of bed to access it not ideal in the night i didn t like the open plan shower sink with glass doors right in the bedroom next to the bed i prefer to wash and clean my teeth in private
