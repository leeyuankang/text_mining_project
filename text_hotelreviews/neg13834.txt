room had been smoked in although it was a non smoking room in fact there was still a packet of marlboro sitting on the table when we went in each time you go into a hotel room you should feel like you are the first to use it this spoiled that illusion considerably guys at the bar after the show were being really fancy with their cocktails which was quite entertaining for a few minutes then i just wanted my pint of beer and g t and its took forever to get to the front of the queue especially after a busy show at the apollo maybe you could have separate cocktail queues somehow
