single rooms are the worst i have ever stayed in so far very very small room not even enough space to put luggage uncomfortable old mattress small bed surrounded by two walls which means you cannot sleep with your legs stretched and have to sleep on your side the bathroom is so tiny that you don t even have space to use the toilet water pressure is so weak that you cannot even take a decent shower breakfast starts at too late for people who need to get out of the hotel early
