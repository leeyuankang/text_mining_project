the breakfast was somehow basic we would have enjoyed an english breakfast the rooms and length of the beds are a bit small especially the single one it may not be a problem unless you are tall but you should inform in advance then i am not sure the cleaning was done properly shampoos soap were replaced and towels too but there were hair remaining in the shower and on the floor in the bathroom and finally the air conditionning was a bit noisy these are information for improvements but we would be happy to come back
