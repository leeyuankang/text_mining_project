ridiculously small room a bathroom so tiny that one could barely turn around very uncomfortable bed poor breakfast no english breakfast blow dryer is from a past century we had a balcony but only to find out that it was shared with the neighbour room so no privacy there but the worst were the paper thin walls we could literally hear every word and step from the neighbours a group of young girls who were additionally to the super thin walls very loud until was not a nice experience
