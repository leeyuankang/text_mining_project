the bed was comfortable for me but for a taller person and up it must be a challenge to sleep comfortable the water pressure was very bad the wifi kept dropping no matter which wifi i connected to even though there is an elevator it doesn t cover all the way to the room i still needed to carry my suitcase on narrow stairs the hotel website said you can use a gym for reduced price however this turned out to be outdated information that they missed to remove from the website you can hear conversations happening and doors closing in nearby rooms
