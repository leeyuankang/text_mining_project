the coffee machine was broken so the only coffee available was drip filter or instant in other hotels i have stayed in their emergency set up would be offering small cafetiere to the patrons at less than per cafeti re per of lavazza fresh group coffee it would be an easy situation to cope with it appeared that most of the patrons on the tables were disappointed with the drip filter coffee option like me i opted for plain hot water the meats at breakfast were v rubbery tasteless there was no drinking water in our room the mini fridge was overheating
