the room we was in is definitely not made for two people and should be sold as a single it s lovely and was clean the bed was ok but made uncomfortable because it had to sleep two when in fact it should just sleep one even though it was lovely i would recommend it sold as a single only the continental breakfast was good but could be made better with more variety and options for guest but the staff were still very accommodating and helpful
