the safe in my room unfortunately did not work henley house is a perfect stay for people who travel as tourists it s cosy but since i am a business traveler i probably will not stay here again missing amenities that are important to me to make my stay as comfortable as possible like the possibility to order room service the hotel having its own restaurant bar hour reception etc a big minus in my opinion is that the rooms hallways weren t tidied up when i checked in at o clock cleaning staff was still busy and sheets and linens were literally everywhere in the hallway i had to take big jumps with a suitcase to pass the mess that does not give the right first impression
