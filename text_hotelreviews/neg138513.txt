the rooms are smaller than you think and we found the bed quite uncomfortable there were tea bags in the breakfast room but no hot water and the staff there did not seem to want to enter into any sort of conversation all a bit awkward really there were also noisy guests playing loud music late at night and since there was no one at reception to deal with it we had to bang on the wall
