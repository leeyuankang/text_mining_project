my room was very warm opening a window solved the problem but it was at the back of the hotel which meant being kept awake most of the night by the noise of earls court station and a nearby air conditioning unit the walls were also very thin and when i wasn t kept awake by the external noise i was disturbed by the all night long snoring of the guest in the adjacent room this may not be a problem in a larger room at the front of the hotel
