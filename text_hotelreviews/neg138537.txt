the room was modern and clean with a tv over the bed but about as small as you could get and a bit claustrophobic so didn t spend much time there there was a squeaky noise outside all the time because of something on the neighbours roof which was annoying but fortunately had my ear plugs the lift was tiny and could fit people close up or person and a suitcase the breakfast people were not that friendly and a good morning would of been nice wouldn t book a single room again
