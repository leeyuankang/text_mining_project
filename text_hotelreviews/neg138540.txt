i never usually bother to write reviews however i had such a bad experience i have decided to make an exception this hotel if it can be called that is responsible for without doubt the worst nights sleep that i have ever had having spent years in the army i m not exactly a princess about where i sleep either the bed was terrible sleeping on the pavement outside would of been more comfortable i have never felt a bed so hard my back still hurts now an its two days later the shower was also terrible with only luke warm water breakfast is served from which is no good when you have to be somewhere early when it is being served its horrendous hardly any selection stale tasteless croissants served with bitter coffee also the reception is not manned between so if you do need anything you can t get it anyway i would never stay here again i have no idea how this place has had good reviews poor poor standards
