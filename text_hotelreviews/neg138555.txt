there was a mix up with the booking which was entirely my own fault and was fixed at the end but the staff was not very sympathetic or helpful beyond the minimum also there was only one set of towels rather than two in a double deluxe room i have reported this to the reception again there was not much response other than an unenthusiastic sorry
