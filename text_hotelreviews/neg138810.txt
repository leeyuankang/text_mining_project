bed too small as my wife and i are large people room rate too expensive for quality of room my wife and i didn t have a good night sleep on either night if we would have known size of bed we would have booked elsewhere we couldn t really go to the reception staff please move us we are too fat the hotel offers a great location for others wanting to be in the hub of camden it does offer good facilities which we didn t use my opinion was only blighted due to the size of the bed which was inappropriate for us
