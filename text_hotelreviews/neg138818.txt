on returning to the hotel just after midnight we tried to order food and drinks from the hour room service menu after tries each time being informed that the items we had selected were no longer available or could be ordered in with an hour s wait time we demanded to know exactly what was available and found the choice was limited to each of different sandwich fillings as we were very hungry we reluctantly ordered from this selection the management subsequently removed the food charge from our bill not the drinks charge but did not seem to take on board the point that the hotel could not fulfil its room service menu we arrived at the hotel at pm already late for an event we had bought expensive tickets for having suffered travel delays nonetheless the check in process was lengthy largely because the reception staff wanted to be sure that we clearly understood that for any subsequent booking we should contact the hotel directly rather than using booking com as we would be offered a discount
