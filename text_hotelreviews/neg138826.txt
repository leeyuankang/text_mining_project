bathroom was very small breakfast was not the best quality not much choice of cold items and hot food bland especially the scrambled egg which had zero taste also the hotel knew it was our wedding anniversary but were unwilling to let us have complimentary water in our room on the second day stating it was only complimentary on the first day a slightly disappointing reaction considering it was a special occasion i feel this is a fairly basic hotel at a not very basic price we ve stayed at the russel hotel in a junior suite for the same price no comparison
