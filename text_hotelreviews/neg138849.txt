the mezannine restaurant in the evening had no staff in it so i was forgotten up there but it was totally redeemed by the young waiter from the glass house who had taken me there despite having a function he still found time to come and check on me take my order and bring my beer the only issue with the food was that the soup and main course came together which was a little crazy but the food was good
