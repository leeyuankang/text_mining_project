we travelled with three teenage children and three adults on a special trip to olympia all booked separately via booking com my friend booked on the same day as us and got a much better deal including breakfast we had to pay per night we were staying two nights and the hotel wanted to charge each for breakfast which for a buffet style meal and in particular for a child is ridiculous we were not in a position to pay this amount of money and were left with our children being split from their friends at breakfast time i did mention it to the reception and they offered us a coffee as compensation which falls far short of what i think they should offer why are novotel offering such extreme rate differences we used the restaurant on a separate occasion the previous night we opted for the restaurant and quite honestly the food was appalling
