i asked for a canal view and was only told at check in that it was not possible why hotels do not have the courtesy to let you know you cant have what you asked so you can decide to book elsewhere felt i had been tricked by the hotel to pay for a room with a view on the scaffolding on the other side of the street check in took people and was very chaotic they charge you potential expenses in advance and reimburse you when you check out meaning they use your money while you are staying with them
