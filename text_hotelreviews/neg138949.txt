in a lively part of camden town close to the nightlife so it can be a bit noisy the earplugs which are provided may be necessary for some checking in and checking out did not go as smooth as i had expected wrong key card was given staff was generally very friendly polite and helpful but rather businesslike and not as welcoming when checking out
