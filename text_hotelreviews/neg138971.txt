there was a miscommunication between booking com the holiday inn reservations team and the hotel staff which meant that the staff thought we had cancelled our booking this caused a lot of confusion and delay at checkin fortunately the reservations manager at the hotel was very gracious and sorted it out the front desk staff could be trained in being more like swans when things don t go to plan they could learn to look graceful above water while paddling furiously to sort out the problem under water if that makes sense
