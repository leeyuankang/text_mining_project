room was nice size but overlooked a flat roof and the side of a building shame as the location was good and a view of the lock would have been nice hotel had signs that said they had free wifi throughout the hotel but i wasnt able to log on in the room and the website seemed to suggest you had to pay for it if you wanted it to work in your rooms breakfast was included in the room price which is good as if i d paid the separately i would have demanded a refund we went down with over mins left on the set time when asked if i wanted tea or coffee i asked for decaf coffee i was bought a pot of tea i took it back and asked again for decaf and the young man didn t seem to grasp i was asking for coffee he eventually went off and came back with a pot of green tea saying this was all they had i cut my losses and said i would manage without there was hardly any pastries left and they didn t get topped up at all the cooked selection was ok the only issue was the hash browns didn t seem to be cooked properly very disappointed and was hoping for better so took the edge of the stay a little
