while location was good its actual positioning left a little to be desired canal bank on one side but grubby back street on the other and unfortunately our window faced out towards the latter not very pleasant and we kept our curtains firmly closed staff on check in and check out seemed distracted by other things and did not give us their full attention we did not feel particularly welcomed they also failed to mention that my card would be charged a standard amount of in advance of any additional expenses and then refunded what we didn t spend this was not the amount i authorised when i entered my pin and i got a bit of a shock when i checked my bank statement a day later it was only when i phoned up to dispute this that it was explained to me overall and i appreciated it s london prices i would say that this hotel is very overpriced from the room rate to the bar it was well over what i would expect to pay for an economy hotel chain we chose it for the location with the hope of a canal side view but it was hardly worth it would not book again
