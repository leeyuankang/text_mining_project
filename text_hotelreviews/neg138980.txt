the room said it had wifi but it was unsuccessful the hotel charged me twice along with a holding fee this wasn t resolved until a week after my stay and the reception staff were extremely unhelpful and rude i had to get confirmation from my bank twice to clarify this is where the missing money had gone as holiday inn reception denied their error at first it is a shame as if it wasn t for this mishap and the way it was handled i would have returned to this hotel
