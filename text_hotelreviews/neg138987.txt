the breakfast was good except some of the breakfast items weren t warm hash browns mushrooms sausage the room was too hot i looked for just a sheet in the night instead of the thick duvet there wasn t any other linen to use instead i didn t get a bottle of water which i would have loved as the tap water had a funny taste then the next day i saw the housemaid had some on her trolley so that must have been overlooked when my room was prepared
