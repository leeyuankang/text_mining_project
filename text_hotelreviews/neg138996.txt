stayed in hotel times in last months longest stay days with my wife as its convenient and its comfortable and the only minor complaint is pretty much you get ignored after you have checked in initially when you are coming going in reception with no eye contact smiles or hellos ever from staff on desk possibly the ground floor is used by many non residents caf meeting place and that s a distraction but its really a stark contrast to when your booking in its as if no your here who cares it does leave you feeling disappointed a lot of staff do adopt a head down approach task over service generally and its the reception desk chatting to each other rather than acknowledging the customer by saying hello when you come in and even the bar team sometimes struggling to smile that lets the place down that s why i don t dine there or use the bar and go out more than i sometimes would i d sum it up in a word impersonal at times bit like a tube station
