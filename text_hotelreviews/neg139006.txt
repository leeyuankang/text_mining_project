osman the night manager and his supervisor even though we d paid for parking he refused to raise the barrier we cordially explained we d paid he was aggressive and not only refused to let us park physically stopped us from going to the room despite the fact we have two young children and a baby oh and it was new year s eve his solution to involve the police and attempt to have us arrested the police were fair allowed us to leave the car and go back to our rooms so if you want to go to prison go to the holiday inn at camden town thanks guys
