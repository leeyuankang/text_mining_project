most things once you passed the lobby it was a different hotel tired dark hallways with cracked broken ceiling tiles preceded a room which was sad and dark shower knobs were missing pieces light switches covered in grime a window that looked directly into another guest room window hot sticky air pumped into the room and overall cheap furniture and finishings it s not an expensive hotel but you can get so much more for your money elsewhere
