this was booked as business trip for a colleague using a company credit card and booked through the booking com website as far as i was aware everything was paid for as you took all the payment details during the booking as i wanted to pay for it the person staying then told me the room was not paid for as he arrived which is very embarrassing and he had to use his card to secure the room then on saturday morning i receive an email not even a phone call to advise me that i had to complete a spreadsheet and send photos of the card used for the booking otherwise the person staying would be charged to their card i was at home and the card was at the office so i didn t have access to it i then had to send photographs of my own card to the reception at holiday inn and pay for it personally suffering credit card charges because of this absolutely outrageous situation as you can imagine in this day and age having to send images of my credit card to someone was not exactly ideal as i have no idea who the hell these people were i have had to call reception of the hotel and get told this is some new policy i will categorically be not using holiday inn ever again and have no idea what on earth bookings com think they are playing at
