there was a wedding function at the hotel we were pre warned about possible noise which was useful however they said the music would stop by midnight we never heard any music but at about guests returned to rooms on our floor slammed doors had extended loud conversations in the corridors woke us up however after contacting reception they sorted it out quite swiftly also there really should be free wifi offered here
