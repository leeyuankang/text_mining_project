i didn t like the fact you had to pay for parking it added an extra on to our bill which was already for one night with no breakfast i think if you are paying for a room in the hotel the parking should be free or a standard rate of per night the breakfast was per person which i though lt was really expensive so we went to weatherspoons which was only a minute walk and was really nice
