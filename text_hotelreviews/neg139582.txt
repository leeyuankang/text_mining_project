when we arrived we were given our room number and keys having entered the room we found it was catered for disabled i spoke to the lady on the desk and was told that it was what i had booked i told her that it was not what i had booked and after a few minutes was given another room however all that time moving our cases around made us miss an appointment with our friends in the city centre
