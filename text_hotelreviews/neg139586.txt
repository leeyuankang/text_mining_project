odd contretemps on checking in i said i d booked a double room and gave my name but the receptionist seemed to think i was saying i d booked two rooms started frantically searching for the name of the person supposedly occupying the second room and continued to do so even after i had explained that i would be sharing the double room with my wife the matter was resolved after i had shown my booking confirmation on my phone but hardly made for a smooth check in later when i asked another receptionist about the access to the executive lounge which came with the room i had booked i was told that this access had not been activated on my key card this receptionist did then activate it but presumably that should have been done when i checked in we generally enjoyed our stay but there did seem to be a blip here nor were we given the signature doubletree chocolate chip cookie which i later learned guests are supposed to receive on arrival
