i did not like it that we did not get what we paid for from booking com it appears our room was advertised as a king size bed in an executive suite but we ended up with a mobility room with a weird bathroom and a queen bed this was after paying almost for the room we complained and were changed to a bigger room with a queen bed however i blame bookin com for this as when we booked the room it was on the basis of an executive room with a normal bathroom and king size bed our mistake was not to check closely the booking confirmation email which had downgraded our booking to effectively what was left we are very busy people and do not expect this however the price did not change or there was no refund we were attending a dinner and had to change rooms at at night after we returned from our dinner as a result of this i will not be using booking com again as i feel ripped off
