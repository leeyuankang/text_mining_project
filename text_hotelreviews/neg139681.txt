on arrival on was disappointed that hotel staff said my request on booking cannot be seen by hotel not sure how but was ridiculous to me and with a packed weekend i will have to wait till another room is available add to this complimentary bits was quite poor milk for just one tea and selection not even quality as a prestigious chain i was expecting more when it comes to room amenities and complimentary bits breakfast selection could be more improved only on the final day was there something different not once was there any fish chicken or turkey in the cold selections but for the price it was overrated but i do make the best of my stay exploring london however the plus side to this had a prime view of new years fire work from the gym and it couldn t be more spectacular as it was the highlight of my stay and this compensated for an amazing experience
