i didn t like the fact that we had to pay so much for parking and after speaking with the manager which he said he would give us half off never put it in the comments at the hotel and was off when we checked out and charged us full price for the parking i was very disappointed in that that was bad business how we are expecting to pay one price and then get hit with other prices and fees on top of that
