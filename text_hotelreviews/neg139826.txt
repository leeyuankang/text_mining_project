i was disappointed in the room it was exceptionally basic i d almost go as far as saying the only thing that differentiated it from a premier inn was a different colour scheme we didn t receive fresh cookies on arrival the bar seemed excessively pricey the reason we asked for omelette was the bacon slices were congealed and sealed together whilst the scrambled egg was inedible there was a blood smear on the curtain next to the desk all in all i think hilton have missed the mark with this particular hotel i wouldbt stay here again sorry
