bathroom was a big disappointment moldy n some places somewhat awkward layout the hotel runs a program that if you don t want the room cleaned put a sign on door handle and get voucher the sign was ignored on several occasions once the room wasn t cleaned but we got no voucher once it was cleaned even with the sign on we gave up on one of the days room clean up showed at pm they are clearly understaffed in cleaning department
