minute walk to nearest tube station not good if you have much luggage the hilton website was poor wrong info about rooms that could fit a rollaway bed and about breakfast fyi if you do an executive room you do not need to pay extra for breakfast it is included both in the executive lounge and in the main breakfast area you can choose either area to go to main area has more choices but it is more crowded the eggs were much better in the main area eggs in executive lounge were a rubbery gelatin like egg casserole every day we felt that the executive lounge should offer the same or better choices than the regular breakfast since you have to pay more to have this room upgrade out of the days we were there they did not have any cookies although daily cookies are advertised on their website not a big deal but an aggravation on an already mediocre stay hilton emailed us before our trip asking if there was anything special we d like to have in our room when we arrived we replied but received none of the items we requested we asked for non feather pillows i m allergic to feathers and a rollaway bed and extra towels for our son we had to ask for these items again after we checked into our room and found they were not there i believe that the email from hilton was only looking for people who wanted to buy extra things from them such as a bottle of champagne we did not opt for any extras that cost more as the night was very expensive already another pet peeve is that they charged for local calls a minute that is ridiculous when you are paying night although the hotel was very nice we would not stay there again because we felt it was overpriced for what you receive
