the hotel was oversold and our room had been given away so we were put in a partially constructed room with loose wiring hanging from the wall we had reserved a room for our family of three but got only one double bed there was no soap the temperature was too high and there was no way to turn it down because the loose wiring was what should have gone to the thermostat the front desk congratulated us on getting a newly refurbished deluxe room it did not seem like they were trying to be ironic we did get moved to a normal room on the second day
