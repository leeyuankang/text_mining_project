some front desk reception staff don t have good enough command of business english when there is a problem they took a pre authorisation on my card twice placing an extra hold of on it and the two junior staff were very dismissive of correcting it the manager helped me fix it and paid for a taxi to make up for the two hours spent missing our planned sightseeing tour which was great but only after i insisted they fix it immediately check your bill and get them to explain it as the pre authorisation really add up you can pay for the accomm side to avoid this beware the percent restaurant surcharge added if the service meal isn t up to it ask to take it off or reduce it our pre booked private taxi service recommended by the hotel at am for a trip to heathrow didn t turn up at i waited for min and by then i had give up and go to the airport and instead negotiate a set fare with a black cab who took us safely to the airport black cabs are safe and reliable pay more and go with them
