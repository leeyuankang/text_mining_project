the bedding was ripped down the side the shower gel provided had hair in it and was full of skum surrounding the holder i particularly don t care for the room being cleaned during my stay in hotels i m happy enough not having my towel changed everyday we put the save energy ego sign on the door which meant no for house keeping and it was ignored returned back to the room to find my stuff moved the room we were in the window only opened a crack which was disappointing
