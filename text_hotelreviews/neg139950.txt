executive lounge was an upsell from front desk but having enjoyed lounges elsewhere this was a real let down with only powdered coffee few cold drinks no alcohol and nuts in a bowl don t bother nearest tube stations feel far on foot and through traffic will need a taxi to get there and arrive unruffled queen executive room anywhere else would be big but in london felt small steep bar tariff so go easy or go to local places for evening drinks
