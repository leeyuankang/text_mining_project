there are long queues at breakfast when you get there around am it would be better if the buffet could be reached from two sides or if there were two or three buffets so that not everyone has to line up for the same table for being a sustainable hotel there are some things that could be improved like no plastic cups in the gym the location is good but no tube station is really close unfortunately there are high buildings next to the hotel that disturb the view to the river we had a room with a view to a construction site
