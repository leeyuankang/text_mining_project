not impressed by the view from my window not happy that as a pensioner it took me quite a while to work my television once i found out it was a telly and choice of stations not to my liking you could have had hot choc as a drink option chose not to stay for breakfast as i was cold in my room cold air coming from somewhere and just wanted to go home it was snowing but no fault of the hotel
