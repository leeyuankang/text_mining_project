the only thing i personally did not like was that i it was very difficult to get the shampoo conditioner body cream out of the bottles as we travelled only with hand luggage we could not get any of that with us also the pc mouse in the room of my kids did not work propper but nothing to worry about as we where out anyway the whole day
