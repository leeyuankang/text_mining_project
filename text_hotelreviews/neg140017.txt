we asked for a lower room as one of us doesn t use lifts we were initially allocated a room on the floor and had to use an emergency back stairs after complaining the manager got us a room on the floor which also necessitated using back stairs there didn t appear to be a proper carpeted staircase which was very disappointing and so we will not stay there again
