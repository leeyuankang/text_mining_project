we had three leaks in three days the shower in the room above ours leaked into ours which was gross it had obviously happened before and the hotel had to be aware of that when they put us in the room because there were water stains on the shower ceiling when we moved in condensation or leaked from the air conditioner in the entryway ceiling the bathroom sink leaked this was not an inexpensive stay and i expected better for my money
