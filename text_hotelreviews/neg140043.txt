this has been mentioned in other reviews but just to reiterate the shower is a bit tight and the water temperature has a tendency to change to scalding and then to ice cold in rapid succession before returning to your desired temperature sort of like what happens when someone flushes a toilet while you are showering not a big deal just something to be aware of especially if you are traveling with children
