the room was generally clean and comfortable as you would expect at a hilton property but there was a previous occupant s hair not from their head on the bathroom floor which we noticed on arrival there is a large building being constructed next to the hotel and although we didn t have any issues whatsoever with noise the construction was the only view from our bedroom on one occasion during our stay we tried to call the hour room service number but there was no answer although the staff on reception were very apologetic and dealt with this professionally and promptly the shower temperature after it was adjusted to your preference sometimes fluctuated between freezing cold and very hot this wasn t so much of a problem for the adults as we could move out of the flow but we had to be very vigilant if showering with our year old child we forgot to request a room with a bath we only reported this on check out and the staff did not have the opportunity to resolve this during our stay so this is by no means a comment on the service we received which was overall very good
