breakfast wasn t the best i have had and a really silly system of when you have booked on line it is only continental breakfast you are entitled to but can pay extra for full buffet breakfast the staff are very keen to point out what you are not allowed to have if you are only continental i felt that they were watching us to make sure we didn t help ourselves to a sausage twin room wasn t particularly big but it was ok for the nights we were there
