the was the noisiest hotel i have ever stayed in the walls are paper thin you could here everything in the rooms next door opposite and above could even here others going to the bathroom and on one night another couple across the hall getting to and from hotel with traffic was a nightmare on occasions the taxi driver refused to take us to the hotel due to congestion
