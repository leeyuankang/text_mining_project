room standard is fine our room was oriented towards the street and was a bit noisy nothing big but worth mentioning for those who are looking for quietness both breakfast are disposed on the same table nothing during the booking process mentioned that two different breakfast were possible to choose it feels really awkward to mix both breakfast and have hotel staff forbid customers to touch the dishes you are not entitled to like talking to children breakfast was a general disappointment a nordic scandic a pounds night hotel has by far a better breakfast
