firstable the guy who receive us was way so rude and literally treat me as a hooker and i have no idea why but him was rude until try he last minute the we have been on the reception so bad impression the breakfast was nothing special and the woman who receive us on the breakfast area is quite rude in a way to say that you may pay for extra money for the whole breakfast and she asked me to get the money immediately just because my bill was already paid what makes me feel so uncomfortable early morning
