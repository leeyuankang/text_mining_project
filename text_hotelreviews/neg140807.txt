the continental breakfast should include at least boiled egg there was no hair conditioner in bathroom accessories our room was located on ground floor and didn t get much daylight in the room staff at reception could be a little bit more welcoming though they were not unfriendly but also not extremely friendly either you d expect when you leave that staff would say thank you for visiting and welcome again i would stay here again
