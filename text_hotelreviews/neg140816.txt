apart from the limited space the room was very hot with no way to reduce the temperature the noise from the pipes in the ceiling was very annoying continuous and the staff couldn t do anything about it i hope they can find a solution for this issue if you need wifi you have to go to the reception area no wifi signal in the rooms breakfast was very disappointing
