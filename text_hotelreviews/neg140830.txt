seems a bit petty but the breakfast area is a bit small and some guests were really loud when talking i can never understand why people have to talk loud to someone on the same table across the room that i can hear every word they say also people talking on mobile phones with the speaker on so that they can eat their food and have a discussion at the same time very rude but not the hotels fault
