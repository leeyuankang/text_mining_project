fell down on the marble steps no one from management even bothered to find out if i was ok asked i could check out later because i came home from hospital at and wanted to rest was told i could stay till but after that there was a pounds charge per hour cant believe they had no consideration to think i fell because it was raining and no one cleaned the steps of the water from the rain
