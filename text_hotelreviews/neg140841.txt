there was a seemingly unjustified distinction between the complimentary continental breakfast and the several additional hot items bacon sausage scrambled eggs that constituted the full english option for an additional charge many hotels in sweden offered a full buffet breakfast including such hot items as waffles eggs bacon and sausage and sometimes potatoes etc without such a distinction so this seemed petty i might have enjoyed the occasional serving of bacon but the continental breakfast was more than adequate with a variety of breads pastries cold cuts cheese fruit yogurt and cereal including hot porridge on request
