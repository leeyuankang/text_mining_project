i booked and paid for four rooms for a total of nights my husband and i were given a room next to the elevator with a broken air conditioner on the i requested another room and was assigned another room next to a different elevator i immediately requested that we be moved i was told there was no other room available at that time i sent an email to the reservation department explaining our problem but did not receive a response the next day after very little sleep my husband went to the desk and requested another room he was angry and of course got immediate action resulting in us being put into from that time on we were extremely happy i felt that the front desk was not listening to me and was not interested in my problem this problem could easily been solved and we would have been happy
