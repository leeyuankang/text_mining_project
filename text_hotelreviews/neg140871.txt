the treatment that we got when we checked in was cold and unfriendly we arrived a bit earlier than the check in time we asked if it would be possible to just get any room because we were after a long travel and after days of hiking we just wanted to freshen up and change clothes we explained that we are in london just for a day to celebrate our daughter s birthday and we will be out all day and in the evening we had tickets to a musical they were not willing to let us in and we had to change our clothes and freshen up in the toilets the whole attitude was totally not welcoming and not service oriented
