the staff was little bit incompetent the last day of our stay they provided us wrong information about time which is needed to transport to stansted airport by taxi and we almost missed the plane also the last morning we ordered the earlier breakfast and everything what we got was yogurt bread and few packages of jam we did not expect the full breakfast but something like this is a shame for the four star hotel also when you after cleaning service find your sleep dress thrown on the floor you are not happy
