me and my friend have been to many hotels but this is by far the worst experience we had during the last hours of our stay one of the hotel staff members entered our room and took a bag full of gifts and souvenirs we left near to our luggage we are very organized couple and this bag couldn t have been regarded as something else unfortunately the hotel refused to take responsibility for this negligence or even tried to help us out they never bothered to answer our emails and when we called they gave excuses such as the manager is currently not here or we will respond by email we feel betrayed by this behavior lack of security and the fact that someone can walk into your room and take from your belonging in the sponsorship of the management furthermore the lack of response of the hotel is shameful and disgraceful we will not come back to this hotel and advised all our friends not to do so as well
