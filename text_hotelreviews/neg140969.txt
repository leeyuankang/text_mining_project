there is only one elevator in this story hotel very long wait so we had to take the stairs i accept it is difficult to built a second one in such an old building wifi was poor showering in the bath tub is not ideal bathroom was rather cramped for space the fire doors make a lot of noise so you wake up early when other guests leave
