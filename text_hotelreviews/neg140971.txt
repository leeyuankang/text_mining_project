i cannot accept that in central london none of the elevators could not be fixed in time have you see a queue for the elevator also we had to pay all the amount before entering to the room and just after they had inform us for the elevator issue as they had all contact details they could inform us in advance for having a chance to book another hotel no matter that we had requested room quiet and at the upper floor we had floor and the visitors from upstairs make the last unbearable sound proof no way i addition they had offer us after we had made a complain at booking as compensation free room upgrade and off for our next visit but at the check out no voucher was given they could easily make partial refund the booking offer us the chance to relocate to another hotel but we had to change all our plans and appointments which were pre booked until today there was not an official apology from a manager of the hotel its a shame for such a hotel
