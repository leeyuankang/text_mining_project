being a left handed eater i found the design of cutlery slightly difficult to use but all you need to do is ask for a different set and they can provide this for you the hotel was slightly set back from the main street with a minute walk to the nearest tube but this was no problem for us and fine if you like a good walk i really don t have anymore faults for this hotel
