overall stay was good but i wasn t happy that the hotel took full payment of the room for the two nights on check in as well as an additional per night deposit i didn t really understand this but having left deposit in total the hotel tried to charge me an extra for the room and on check out the i was due to be refunded they argued and said it was only this took a lot of waiting around and i was disappointed that the hotel tried to get more money out of us
