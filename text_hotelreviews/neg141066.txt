the staff were appalling and rude the evening manager actually swore at myself and friend when we asked for a glass of water i have never experienced such poor service bad language and no apology the next day by the general manager we were actually made to feel like we were making up the complaint disgusted would not return or recommend it to anyone customer service is so good now in hotels i think this hotel does not know the meaning of looking after their customers properly or dealing with complaints
