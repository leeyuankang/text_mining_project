our stay was thursday december there was a private christmas party in a room downstairs when this finished the manager closed the residents bar as they wanted the revellers to disperse although i understand the logic behind this it cut short our evening not at the private party just staying over the closure was made worse as once the revellers had dispersed the exceptionally unpolite bar man who said he was a concierge so it wasn t his job to serve drinks said each person that had waited patiently for an hour for the drunken crowd to leave could only have drink each as it wasn t his job to serve this was at midnight which is not late i have never stayed in any other hotel in london that has closed its bar to residents will not be staying again
