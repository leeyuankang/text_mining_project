the blakemore staff is the worst we ve ever encountered the concierge is not conversant with the city eg we asked for info on the tate museums and he sent us with great confidence to the wrong one when we asked at the front desk for a recco on good local restaurants they recco d a take out joint and a chain restaurant after a bit of searching on our own we found a wonderful local street full of fantastic and varied restaurants they refused to call a cab for us one day saying they were only allowed to call their double the price partner limousine service the next day they offered to call a cab and when i expressed surprise they expressed surprise at what their coworkers had told us the night prior when we asked them to put a glass of wine in the bar on our room tab they told us they couldn t do so without a credit card hold the next day when we checked out we discovered they had added a hold i was at the front desk times during our night stay and every time there were people ahead of me expressing frustration and dismay at various aspects of their stay eg wrong room relative to booking room not cleaned problem with bill etc there are many wonderful hotels in london steer clear of this one a couple of other notes they cleaned the room sporadically the window in the bathroom was not insulated outside light was visible between pane and frame so the bathroom was freezing the wifi was inconsistent and needed constant rebooting
