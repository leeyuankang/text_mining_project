unfortunately in the good gesture of upgrading us they gave us the room on the floor directly above a function room we had a busy day ahead of us in london the next day therefore tried to go to sleep at only to be kept awake by the sound of music and bass vibrating our floor boards i called reception and inquired to when it would be turned off and they said it was their staff christmas party i then said i did not pay this amount of money north of for a room to be kept awake by your staff partying to which the receptionist answered what are we meant to do there are no clubs around here i found that response completely un professional and un acceptable the music was not turned off until nearer midnight and it completely tarnished the entire experience to be kept awake by the hotels staff opposed to guests is something new the next day i raised my complaint with the receptionist and she said management would call me to apologise and explain three days later management have not phoned me i still wait an explanation
