didn t like that on the second morning there was a long queue for breakfast people were having to give their room numbers and wait to be called there were about ten rooms to be called before us and we didn t have enough time to wait so we had to have a continental breakfast in the main entrance which was quite draughty from the door being constantly opened as people were coming and going however the waitress was very attentive water for shower bath took a long time to run hot and bathroom was a bit chilly no complimentary biscuits in the room
