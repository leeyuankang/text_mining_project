i had paid for breakfast but the staff said i wasn t on their list even after i showed them my email confirmation by the time they realised i was entitled for breakfast there was only of breakfast left so i didn t feel it was fair or worth my money for the waste of time n the lady at the breakfast counter was practically shouting at me that i wasn t on the list i was so embarrasssed infront all the other guests
