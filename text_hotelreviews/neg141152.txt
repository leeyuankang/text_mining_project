the night check failed to wake as according to my wake up request he attempted to blame it on a system glitch when i know in fact it wasn t true he is a very well seasoned member of the hotel staff i witnessed him as he came on to shift earlier that evening reprimanding his fellow staff members at the reception area desk which totally unprofessional whether right or wrong it shouldn t have been done out in the open as a returning hotel guest it did not sit well something as such should have been done behind closed doors
