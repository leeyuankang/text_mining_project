the hotel was very noisy i could not sleep i could even hear the guests walking showering and the flushing of the toilet above i was moved to three different rooms but had the same problem the hotel is very small and noisy i initially booked an executive room on arrival i paid extra to have a suite for my three night stay i was disappointed with the poor level of service and we did not even receive an apology for our sleepless nights
