the room was dusty and dirty no matter how many time i ask them to clean it the housekeeping staff were rude they have a weird policy that you are not allowed to order in but they dont offer food from to pm and after pm they had one elevator and we had strollers with us so we had to wait for a while before we got it and the funny thing was that the enternace didnt have a ramp so whatever we wanted to enter exit the hotel we had to carry the strolleres up the stairs the breakfast buffet had the same dishes every day
