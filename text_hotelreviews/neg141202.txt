they have one elevator only it takes time to got it especially in the morning so you will need to use stairs most of the time which is not suitable for wheelchair users they didn t mention that we have a continental breakfast in the reservation which has very few items so don t be surprise if you want to eat more you have to pay five pounds or you will stick to the available croissant and salad
