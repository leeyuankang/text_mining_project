the bar staff have major trust issues aproaching the bar to order a drink i was stopped and told no need to go the bar as my order would be taken at my table myself and my wife were then asked several times while sitting having the said drinks that we need to pay for them i asked if there was a problem and was told that i would be surprised how many people don t pay and walk out this was on the first night of a night stay that cost i was hardly going to take off for the sake of one round of drinks after paying the hotel fee upfront at check out today while waiting of our taxi to the train station we were also told to leave the bar as my two children were eating a sandwich that was bought in as they had a restaurant below the bar area when i said we were only waiting of a taxi the barmaid waitress was unmoved and adamant that my children must go outside to eat there sandwich or order from the menu thanks for that very untrusting suspicious staff that need a lesson in manners and also need to realise that they have left a lasting impression hotel was very good and the cleaning staff were friendly and helpful the hotel management would do well to reverse the roles of bar staff cleaners a shame that the lasting impression of this hotel was the bad experience of the bar lounge staff i won t be using this hotel again only because i felt i was looking over my shoulder all the time and was uncomfortable all the time while in the bar if your wanting a relaxing time my advice is to ignore the waitresses and pay up front at the bar also plan your escape a bit better than i did as in don t try and fill any time away from this hotel on the day of checkout and return as your not very welcome once you have checked out
