we arrived at the hotel a we wanted to order lunch but were told the kitchen wasn t open by the staff behind the bar at we sat at a table on the terrace no one came to serve us i finally went to the bar to order drinks i asked again if we could order food we were told they needed check and then we were told we could we ordered the waitress got our order completely wrong we paid over for one night this didn t include breakfast i feel it was very expensive for what we got the service in the bar and the terrace is not what you d expect from a star hotel
