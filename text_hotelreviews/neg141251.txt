the bed was hopeless i thought it was just my room but i soon found out that my sons room also had the same problem with the bed too soft and you will sink into it my wife and me suffered from severe back pain sleeping on it im willing to bet most of the rooms have the same bed condition we complained and the staff said he will look into it and give us another room but he soon disappeared and when we met him later in the lobby he just smile and said hello like we never complained at all rooms have been already charged and there is no such thing as cancelling and getting your refund back we knew the terms so complaining wouldnt help continental bfast is included in the package and if you want a full english bfast pay an extra i do not understand why they need to do this as it creates a negative impression among customers and i have heard many of them whispering about this scam like technique around the tables honestly do not take the bfast option as you will be left very very disappointed its not worth the money at all there are other places nearby offering a hearthy hot bfast for only save you a pile of money for the money you spend here there are many other hotels nearby which do not charge as much and have much much more comfortable beds all the hotels in london brag about walking distances to restaurants and public transportation i believe that this hotel has quite a distance to go to the tube and the restaurants around bayswater as compared to the others i would not recommend to others to stay here stay around paddington area is much better
