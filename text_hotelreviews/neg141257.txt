i booked a room with breakfast for days but i was surprised when i got to the breakfast room they informed me that i cant eat from the hot dishes which include the english breakfast eggs beans etc since its not free and i have to pay extra pounds if i want to you will only be allowed to have breakfast from the cold dishes which weren t clean at all i found hair twice in the plates then i stopped eating anything from the plates i only had sealed food like bananas apples and yogurt the glasses were so dirty from the inside and outside i didn t even enjoy one cup of coffee the carpet of the room smelled funny and we had to switch on the ac every time for it to go away the hotel is located at a nice quiet area few restaurants are around but the tube station was a bit far we had to walk for at least mins to get there i have stayed at many other locations in london and this wasn t the best overall i found it to be too pricey with no value for money i wouldn t stay there again
