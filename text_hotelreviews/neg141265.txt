bed was a little soft for my liking but not uncomfortable decor a little dated and tired looking but ok and clean got in late from the airport and arranged a late checkout despite this was woken early well before before normal checkout time by very persistent housekeeping who didn t speak english so couldn t explain that i had a late checkout receptionist did apologise and not her fault but i did hear housekeeping bashing on all the doors along the corridor so am sure i wasn t the only one who may have been affected
