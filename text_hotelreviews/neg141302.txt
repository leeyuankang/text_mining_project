was disappointed that there was no complimentry water in rooms nor were there items in mini fridge bar so there was not even the option of having something without having to call room service not convenient for some guests breakfast was included but only cold breakfast to get the hot breakfast it cost more this was not clear at reservation and not a very nice approach to guests very sneaky extra charge in my opnion and was disappointed by it and how i was asked to pay before eating
