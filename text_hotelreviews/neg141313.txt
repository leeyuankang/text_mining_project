when we arrived our room was not ready so we checked our luggage in while we went for lunch when we got back the desk clerk chased down the bellman to get our luggage he retrieved our luggage and placed it carefully in a corner that was about feet from where we were standing instead of handing it to us and then walked away never speaking a word so we didn t know if we were to take it or if someone would bring it for us we took it and went to our room a very awkward early experience the room could benefit from some updating floor tile was cracked in several places the bathroom and would move when walked upon the hairdryer is attached to the inside of a drawer on the desk i suspect this is done to prevent theft but it is highly impractical since the mirror is off to the side and the cord of the hairdryer is not long enough to reach the mirror you have to dry style your hair blindly internet service though free was very unreliable i attempted to write this review earlier but couldn t get on the internet cleaning staff was inconsistent sometimes they left coffee and cream packets other times not on one occasion when we asked room service to bring up cream they brought it in a small metal creamer we left the creamer out so the cleaning staff would pick it up and they never did instead the cream was left to spoil
