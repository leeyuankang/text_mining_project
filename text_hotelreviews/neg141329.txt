the room was very small we have stayed at the hotel before and had a much bigger room for the same price as i recall i asked if we could have a bigger room and the lady at reception very kindly said we could but not until the next day so we left it because we couldn t be bothered to move all our stuff having unpacked etc we appreciated the offer of another room though so thank you for that
