in the order i asked for a silent room at the night out of four there was a terrible noise came from another room not only the night manager was unable to locate the very noisy room it seems as if he doesn t have the authority as well as the minimal ability to solve the problem so i ve had to wait till the morning it has totally killed my day i never write bad things about staff but this was unusual when hotels cover old woody stairways with mats they should at least have a night manager that doesn t insult their residents time after time
