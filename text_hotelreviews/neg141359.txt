staff quite rude and unhelpful ripped me off on a second night stay booked the first night on booking then needed to extend another night and seriously increased the price then i was sat in the lobby area and overheard somebody walk in and book there and then much cheaper complained about this and they said they couldn t do anything as the rate fluctuates not a good way to make somebody want to come again rooms a bit on the small size
