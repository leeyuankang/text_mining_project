the key for the room didn t work and i was left wondering on the floor what to do i went back to reception told them about the problem the door doesn t open and the girl at reception said it is fixed went back to the floor in their elevator which i felt its gonna fall dawn any second but i reached safely thank god to find that my problem haven t been solved and i went back to the reception for the third time to be told that they have to send someone to check it for me and look for the problem with the door they took deposit when i arrived for a room that doesn t open and a mini bar that was empty will not go there again for sure
