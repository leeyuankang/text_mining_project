room was small and stuffy and hot bathroom smelt of cigarettes not worth the money for a star hotel lobby staff judgemental and rude i think it s stupid that i had to pay extra money for a full english breakfast that was supposed to be provided within the price of the room especially when there wasn t really much choice other than a full english the wifi didn t work neither did the tv at one point we were given what looked like the smallest room on our floor i just thought i could have received a lot better service for what i paid for the staff just looked at me as if i was stupid just because i m only i m still a paying customer i still deserve equal service and that isn t what i received
