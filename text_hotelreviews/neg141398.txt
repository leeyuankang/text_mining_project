i didn t like finding someone s soiled underwear in a paper bag in my bed i didn t like that unless i paid for early access to my room i would not be allowed entry until i arrived at knowing that i would be too early to check in and saw people departing however the room was not cleaned and ready until according to reception no rooms were ready i have never stayed in a hotel that took someone hours to clean
