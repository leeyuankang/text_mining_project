well the spread of the continental breakfast was pretty limited i know some guests already mentioned about this but was pretty surprised how limited it was i ended up eating two croissants with jam and nutella they did provide us with hard boiled eggs on friday and saturday then on sunday maybe due to the amount of guests they no longer served them if you would like a better meal you have to upgrade it with a certain amount of money and you ll be able to get the rest of the buffet spread which consists of scrambled eggs hash browns mushrooms etc to be honest we have stayed in other hotels in the uk which had a similar room rate even ones cheaper and they provided us with a much wider spread for breakfast hope they could improve this but nevertheless breakfast is just minor for us the main thing is that we enjoyed our nights stay
