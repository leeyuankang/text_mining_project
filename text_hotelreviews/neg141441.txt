when we checked in we were given a very small room when i reserved the room on booking com i was looking at location price and room size i found this room and it was listed at being just over square feet in size the room we were first given was around half of that i immediatly went down to the front desk and showed them the room listed on the website was over square feet the clerk said she had to talk to her supervisor she returned a few minutes later and said she had a room available at that size what would have happened if the room wasn t available all in all we liked our room and got what we paid for the bed was a bit soft
