the reception staff seemed to find it very difficult to trust a young couple to use their facilities it was somewhat humiliating that they were reluctant to provide services such as room service without taking a payment upfront in addition to the booking side of things breakfast was a total let down i had already taken a look at some reviews but did not believe what previous guests had written they were right very little on offer the rooms were also a lot smaller than what is advertised and i am certain that the executive room was just a basic premier inn room in a different colour scheme not worth the money at all
