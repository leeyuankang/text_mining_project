although had booked continental breakfast had to pay an additional for hot breakfast which was not hot or enjoyable asked reception to arrange for a taxi for us which i believe was a private hire the return journey by normal black cab from the same place was half of what we paid for the private hire so do not use the hotels private hire company it s shockingly expensive
