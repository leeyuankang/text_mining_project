the only issue i had with the stay was the staffs unwillingness to let me pay for things as i went along after having a couple of drinks at the bar i tried to pay for my order and the staff seemed more inclined to get me to charge it to my room which i did not want to do at one point i ordered a drink to take to my room and the bar staff said they would bring the bill over the total was around pounds and when i gave the staff a pound note instead of getting my change they said we will keep this as a tip which i found outrageous i told them no and insisted on my change i would have happily left them a tip for the service as up until that point they had been lovely but to bluntly tell me they were keeping pounds as a tip was a bit over the top
