hotel staff is incredible unprofessional and unpleasant hotel treats guests as guilty unless they prove otherwise in executive rooms on the first level you can enjoy every passing of noisy underground train with wall from the window on the first floor there are some rooms with heavy smell from bathroom pipes and mold many times you have to wait in the line for the breakfast but still with no order never again even for free
