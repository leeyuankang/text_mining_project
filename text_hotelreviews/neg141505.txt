heating was extreme in corridors and i was not able to reduce the heating in my room was told this was fixed centrally consequently had to sleep with windows open which meant occasional noise from the traffic revellers and dog barking bathroom was pristine but fixed shower screen made access to the bath plug difficult and the floor was very slippery i did slip on getting out of the bath and was fortunate not to hurt myself
