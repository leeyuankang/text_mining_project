pretty average continental breakfast premier inn is better junior suite we booked as offer clearly did not enjoy complementary facilities that should come with the suite eg robe slippers daily paper bottled water in any case staff did not ask if we wanted them no point in having the suite apart from being a larger room with sofa already made up as a bed on our arrival even though we had only booked for breakfast staff thought we wanted breakfasts every day only one very slow small temperamental lift
