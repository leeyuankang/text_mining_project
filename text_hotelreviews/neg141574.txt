i was given a room in the basement that s right at the rate of nearly pounds a night i had basically no windows the only window was facing a wall a few feet away was next to the gym and had to listen to people walking up and down the hallway all night likely employees of the hotel who were obviously working on top of that i woke up to the smell of breakfast food in my room while i love breakfast the smell was so strong and pervasive that i couldn t enjoy it and grew increasingly frustrated for the absence of fresh odorless air
