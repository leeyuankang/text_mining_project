this hotel has ridiculously rigid procedures around payment authorisation for reservations made and paid with company credit cards i had prepaid for my stay but i was effectively charged again on my personal credit card as a deposit until the cardholder filled out a form signed it and sent it to the hotel together with a photocopy of the credit card and their passport i wasted hours in arguments the hotel manager was stand offish and rather rude which didn t help matters at all also there was very loud noise at night from tons of glass crushing while being disposed of in containers very disturbing due to the irregularity and loudness of it the continental breakfast was very poor and the english breakfast which came at a supplement was not satisfactory either poor choice and quality of the ingredients not properly cooked
