i didn t like the fact that none of the plugs worked in our room my partner wanted to have a bath and he couldn t because the bath plug wasn t staying down and was the same for the sink i also dont like that breakfast finishes so early and the cleaning maid decided to bang on our door at when we had had a late night and didn t want to be up super early so we missed breakfast by the lift in the hotel is tiny and very very hot it takes a while to come down and you can only fit in at a squeeze
