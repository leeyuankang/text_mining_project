the main elevator was out for our entire stay meaning everyone in the hotel had to use a tiny person one including staff it was not good there s no way to prevent the showers from getting the floor wet not unique to this hotel and on our last night there was this inconsistent grinding noise coming from the walls it kept me up for hours would not stay again
