i was on the lower ground floor so essentially my room was in the basement with a single window that opened into a shaft this was not a problem for the purposes of my visit the room was very quiet and dark but under different circumstances e g traveling with my wife i would have been disappointed no big deal but i couldn t turn off the heat to the towel rack in the bathroom which made the bathroom super hot
