we booked a club room however on arrival we were upgraded to a junior suite on floor well the bathroom was so small that when you stepped in door opening out into bedroom you were virtually on the toilet no room to swing a cat when sat on the loo my partners knees touched the door frame there was mould in the tile grout in the shower and the rain forest shower head dripped all night the heating in the room had no thermostat and as a result the radiators were on it was degrees outside the air con didn t kick in to compensate the light on the telephone flashed all night saying there was a message eventually we put it on the floor with a pillow over it as we couldn t stop it even though we cleared the message the pillows on the large bed were lumpy like cotton balls inside the receptionist was very rude on the phone when the following day i queried a payment of taken on my debit card for expenses it wasn t cleared off when i payed the bill as i had been told it was my job to phone the bank to put a stop on it ridiculous
