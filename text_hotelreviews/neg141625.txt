hotel has terrible soundproofing between the floors you could clearly hear the walking of adults and running thumping of children from the floor above to which the hotel was unable to do anything about and in the absence of parents being nearby we also had to stop children from running up and down the hallway of our floor it s a hotel not a playground this hotel should review or implement a policy for ensuring children behave properly if they wish to also provide a relaxing ambience for other guests wifi very slow
