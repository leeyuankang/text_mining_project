room was lovely however tea and coffee in room was not enough for two people had no mini bar so had to get water etc for room staff spoke poor english so made check in complicated staff didnt make me feel welcome lift was broke so had to use stairs and was not offered help to carry luggage to room when paying foe the remaining nights upon arrival i had to pay another deposit fpr any extras that i miggt have during my stay i was annoyed that this was not stayed before arrival or when booking cooked breakfast was poor sausages were hard under cooked scrambled egg for my three night stay i believe the room was the only highlight which is disgraceful for an supposedly up market hotel for three nights i would pay around for this hotel at the most way over priced
