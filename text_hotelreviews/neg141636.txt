this hotel is appalling mainly due to the awful reception staff painting and sanding was taking place in all accommodation common areas during our day stay on the last night of our stay toxic adhesive fumes filled the entire hotel the reception managers solution to this was to move us to another room which would have also been inundated with fumes understandably maintenance work needs to be done and there will always be guests in a hotel but the managements total inability to understand what they were asking guests paying full nightly rates to put up with as beyond a joke we checked out and moved to another hotel nearby which was fantastic
