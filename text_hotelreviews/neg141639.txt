the worst about this hotel and what drove me nuts was internet it was horrible i complained several times and once even it tried to fix the problem and it still did not work properly traffic was very slow did not work kept kicking you out of wifi i will not be staying in this hotel anymore unless they fix there internet heating did not work for some reason it did not bother me too much as it was august and it was not too cold yet despite of heavy rains and cooler weather free breakfast was only continental and pretty basic i had to pay extra to upgrade to a proper english breakfast mattress was extremely soft so much that i was falling inside not good especially if you have back problems
