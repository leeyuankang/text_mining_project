on checkout day housekeeping annoyed me times how hard is it to wait until someone has checked out in order to try and come in to clean i don t understand why they came times on checkout day also there is absolutely no sound proofing at all can hear all outside noise can hear every single movement from above so when housekeeping is cleaning the room above you can hear absolutely everything can hear all that happens in the corridor and even the tv of the adjacent room did not make for a comfortable stay even though the room was nice enough tv was also painful to use couldn t get it working properly and the remote sensor didn t work while sitting on the bed
