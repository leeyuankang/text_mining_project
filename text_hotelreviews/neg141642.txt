the staff was very rude and non cooperative except for one young lady who really tried to help they night we arrived our ac wasn t working and the reply we got from the staff was that you can sleep with your windows open the property manager was extremely rude and lacked any kind of customer service he didn t show any interest in resolving the problems my over all experience was below average and would never recommend it to anyone
