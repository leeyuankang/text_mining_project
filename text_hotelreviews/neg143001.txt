my baby had a cold while we were in london so i wasn t sleeping all night i called housekeepers at am to bring extra complementary water so they did but the next night one of the staff his name was ron refused to bring me bottled water and if i want more he will charge it to the room very rude and he hanged up the phone very quickly this thing has never happened to me at any hotel around the world they always and every day will offer more than complementary water for two ppl this thing really bothered me and i don t want to come back
