busy hotel all day staff dont even notice you and most of time not welcoming you worst customer service i had in my life felt like stars hotel because i always stay at luxury stars hotels and get treated well this time didnt happen i told them its my time at your hotel and they were like oh really yeah sure its hyatt regency churchill the best and blah blah blah no one showed me how to use card for elevators and nobody bothered to show me the way to my room or presenting the room and the facilities they have like go find the room yourself and i requested late check out and didnt get it because its over booked i never heard that before and when i was waiting fof my taxi i noticed alot of guests leaving from their rooms late after pm so they just wanted me out of the room and my luggages were left outside the hotel pm and im leaving after pm when i asked them why they said we are busy and didnt get chance to store them i understand the being busy part but why throwing them outside like im not welcome here and what was the worst of all when i asked times to talk to the manager he she didnt want to meet me which was really rude i paid for nights to get the best customer service but i was so disappointed next time im london sure i dont want to be back to this stars staff hotel and will never recommend it to any of my friends or family
