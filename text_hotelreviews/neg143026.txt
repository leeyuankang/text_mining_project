what i didn t like was nothing to do with hyatt churchill it is all about hyatt group they downgraded me after nine years stays on weekly basis just because i didn t stay in hyatt for months and that was because of grand hyatt dubai that they had gap and lackof eexperience in handling my account as they account manager left the hotel and the new person didn t know which rate to apply until someone else came and solved the problem during that time i was staying in other hotel which took them moth to resolve it
