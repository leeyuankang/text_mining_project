the wifi was over pounds a day what a rip off when nearly every hotel now offers this for free the wahaca restaurant is downstairs in the same street and it s free wifi can be reached from many rooms the decor is dated but very high quality so it s a bit like being in a bond movie from the s the corridors to the rooms stink of dust they need a good airing deep clean however the room itself was very clean and fresh
