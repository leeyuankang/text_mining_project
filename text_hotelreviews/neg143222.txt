tried the breakfast morning out of and decided to visit cote brasserie the next day the promised selection of pastries and croissants didn t happen croissant or pastry appeared to be all that they were happy to give away the view from room is rubbish a brick wall actually we asked a receptionist to give us directions to the london palladium which was km away and he couldn t understand what we were asking started telling us about local shops and beware our credit card got blocked whilst we were still in london as the hotel had applied to take our whole day predicted bill before we turned up from the card that we had registered and as we paid cash on leaving we could have been left without any payment option if we hadn t taken a back up card very naughty of them the toilet was in a very awkward position in the bathroom if you didn t lock the door you could have had your legs taken off
