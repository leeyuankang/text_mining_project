on the downside the i booked a single room and it was tiny there was a shower no bath the head in the shower couldn t be adjusted so you have no option but to get your hair wet they didn t supply shower caps the room was very clean and good amount of tv channels but the decor was very dated the biggest disappointment was that this hotel charge for wifi it was for wifi access for hours in any decent hotel wifi is free for this reason i would be reluctant to stay here again
