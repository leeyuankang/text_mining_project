marked the hotel down because in the alley way behind the hotel the restaurants have to clear away the empties from the night this is very loud and our room did not have double glazing so we were awake until being disturbed by the clatter of bottles and then we were woken again on sunday morning at by the rubbish collection i did complain at reception on check out but all i got told was that they would put a note on my account so i didnt get that room again i didn t feel this was a satisfactory response considering i d had only hours sleep shame because i love the rest of the hotel
