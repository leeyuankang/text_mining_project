dont like the rather old jacuzzi bath needs updating also prefer an opening window in the room my partner will not stay in a hotel if the window wont open i realise its for safety but a rail fixed to the window frame perhaps would solve this ok at this time of the year but wouldn t like it in the summer also the air con was a bit noisy the room was quiet no outside noise
