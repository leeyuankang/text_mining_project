the room i had was at the side of the hotel opposite a pub this wouldn t have been an issue if the window sealed properly but as it was it was akin to having it open so it was very noisy until late at night and then the general workings of london kicked off again at about on top of that even with the aircon turned off it still rumbled away so all in all i managed about hours sleep
