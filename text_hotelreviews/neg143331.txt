rathbone hotel looks quite impressive from the street but also a little out of place being situated on a back street off tottenham court road as a lone female i m afraid i didn t feel very safe arriving quite late at night as i did the hotel s policy seems to be that they hold a fee on your credit debit card for potential purchases even before you ve decided to use any bar services i managed to talk the reception staff out of this due to my late arrival but it s not appreciated to try bumping up a guest s final bill especially if they might be on a budget if i had wanted to spend more money i d have used a more centrally located hotel with more stars
