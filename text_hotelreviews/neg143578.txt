the reception staff were frosty bordering unfriendly there are no water or ice stations located anywhere in the hotel for the breakfast options are ridiculous the rooms are really close together with narrow awkward hallways good luck staying up late around and not getting a call to turn your tv off really there is no glass or curtain on the shower so the entire bathroom floor ends up covered in water when taking a shower even attempting to jam myself up against the faucet into the square that s created by the side of the sink didn t helped i m a skinny girl and the place still got drenched i ve stayed in hotels all over the world and this hotel is nothing special the pictures make it far grander than it is i m not a fan of european hotels but i m pretty sure you can find better for the money in paris i was very disappointed with my stay here
