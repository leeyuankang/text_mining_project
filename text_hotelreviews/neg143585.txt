room temperature was often too hot or too cold in the night bathroom was a little small so while i loved the water pressure i was often fearful of soaking the bathroom when the room was cleaned it was not thorough while the beds were made and the floors tidied cleaned mugs were not replaced with fresh tea coffee sugar and creamer the lady at the front desk when checking out was not very friendly
