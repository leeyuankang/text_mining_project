serving staff at breakfast took a long time to respond and there were no vegetarian options for a cooked breakfast even though i had requested this there were staff which is inefficient use of resources especially as no cooking was required very expensive prices at the bar g t was and beauty treatments for a massage the hotel appeared opulent at first glance but there was flaky paint and stains on furnishings that i wouldn t expect of such a highly rated hotel during one breakfast meal there were unaccompanied children and one child pocketed lots of packets if nutella and the other ate very little from a big plate of food they seemed to be very familiar with the waiting staff and i wondered if they were actually guests i would prefer the hotel to spend on guests and reduce high prices than on waste i wouldn t return for this reason poor value for money
