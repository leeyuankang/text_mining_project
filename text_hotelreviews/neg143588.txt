i was excited to have a good stay in this hotel for the good location but unfortunately i shocked with the not clear and honest description for the facilities and rules they forced me to pay more and change my room and its not my fault to not have a good details in booking proceeded and i didn t have a good welcome by staff in arriving and the bathroom smell was disgusting they said through booking com all children under are free for stay and that not true the booking com couldn t do anything and this is not the first time i had trouble with the booking com and they can t solve it before only saying sorry for what happen to you so this is the last time to book through them the hotel need to change their staff specially the night shift and have to fix their bathrooms and change their details of the facilities and the rules and we will see if booking com they clear to but my comments and review
