i would not recommend the spa treatments the cost does not justify the experience for treatment with a very nice well meaning therapist only rather young inexperienced so it was more like a euro experience for over x that maybe that was just my luck of the draw but i would be remiss not to draw attention to the possibility it could happen to other customers for that money we should flamin well get champagne a bodyscrub a bodywrap and maybe some canap s imho because otherwise one feels somewhat fleeced alternatively i would advise charging sensible prices for the simple experience provided we don t even pay those prices in london and that s saying summat
