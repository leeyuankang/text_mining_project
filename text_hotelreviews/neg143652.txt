there were no toiletries in our room on the first day and even though i mentioned this at reception and asked for soap shower gel shampoo etc to be sent up none came i had to go out and buy shower gel and use face wash to wash my hands until we got back to our room on the second day a shame because other than this our stay was fantastic and the hotel really great
