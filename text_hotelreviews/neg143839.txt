my friend and i had an interesting experience at this hotel the night we stayed there the fire alarm went off early in the morning we found out the next day that apparently there was a mechanical problem with the system and this was the third time in three months the fire alarm went off without any clear causes i d urge management to fix this problem as soon as possible the communication between staff members needs improvement upon checking in we asked to extend our check out time by an hour to in the afternoon to our surprise and disappointment between the next day three staff members walked into our room without consent while my friend and i were changing and packing i communicated to the property manager the next morning about our unpleasant experience and received a refund upon my insistence i would not recommend this hotel unless there is significant improvement in its management
