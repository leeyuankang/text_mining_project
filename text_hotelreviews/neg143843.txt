the hotel in itself is quite okay however some issues hold it back the safe in our room was small not laptop sized did not work no batteries and was not bolted to the wall the staff was very friendly and offered us to switch rooms however having partly unpacked we did not want the extra hustle this could have been resolved in advance especially since we only checked in at around we did store our valuables in the hotel safe at the reception and the one in our room got fixed inserted batteries a day later the room itself lacks a cupboard to store clothes i did not check that when booking only a few hangers without the option to hang pants if you are staying for more than a couple of days travel with suits this may be an issue the breakfast was very disappointing monotone with very few options haven t been to paris many times so difficult to know the local standards i am travelling a lot for work leisure and this was one of the worst hotel breakfasts i ve had the pleasure to have i would recommended opting for the sans breakfast option
