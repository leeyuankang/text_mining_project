out of rooms we should checked in were already occupied this is a bad experience after a long drive since you just want a break the organisation wasn t good and an excuse because of eastern isn t an excuse please upgrade your hotel system no towels in the room and in the bathroom were still boxes to repair some stuff no go use the stockroom for that the heater wasn t working and it was freezing cold in the room even the employee said it was freezing cold the socket wasn t working to charge your electronics overall the room wasn t ready to be rented and therefore never shouldn t be rented out to someone for this prize we checked out after one night and it wasn t value wasn t worth the money
