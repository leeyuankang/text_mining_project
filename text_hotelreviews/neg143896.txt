thought it was a horrible room as it was below street level so no windows also thought advertised picture of room accommodation misleading as picture was really of the breakfast area no microwave even though this was an advertised part of the accommodation they were unable to provide a microwave which meant the kitchenette was not very useful the price of the accommodation was a bit expensive
