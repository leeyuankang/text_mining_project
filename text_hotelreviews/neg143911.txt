we had booked a suite which we understood would have rooms with a bed and the other with a couch es we needed the extra room as we were traveling with a small child so we would have space for the crib and playing the room came with large beds in each room and one single bed in the larger room the beds essentially filled the room so we were just able to squeeze the crib in between one of the beds and the walls there was very little space to move around i had read reviews prior to staying that people had difficulty with a suitcase and can definitely see how this would be an issue with a single room the room was located right off the foyer so we could hear louder guests but this was easily remedied by closing the fire doors between our room and the entry way
