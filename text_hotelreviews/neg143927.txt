the room was advertised as self catering but there was only a small microwave kettle and sink in the kitchen area i was expecting at least one hob ring and one saucepan there were no bowls etc for heating food in the microwave only two small cereal type bowls and two small plates everything else was excellent although best get down to the breakfast room early before all the nice things go
