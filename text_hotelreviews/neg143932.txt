the shower toilet was off of one of the bedrooms so the person sleeping in the other room could not visit the loo without going through the other bedroom fine for us but may cause a problem for others the grill function on the microwave is abysmal so kitchen facilities really only suited for simple tea coffee and warming up a ready meal etc
