as reported to duty staff bedside lights bathroom mirror light and one other electrical item which i can t remember did not work bedside light was important as i read while my my wife sleeps friendly staff said this couldn t be fixed until next morning we were there for only the one night so this was disappointing also there was very little room to move around to the far side of the bed approx between the corner of the bed and furniture scenery from window was not pleasing
