the after care i was charged twice for my stay and when i telephoned the comfort inn i was met with aggression i explained on which dates i was over charge and the gentleman mr haq told he could only see one payment he started shouting to me when i asked for him to check it again and i was told to send my statement to him these company s are quick to take your money but are slow to do anything for you i then spoke to booking com david who was more than pleasant but still i had to prove to booking com by sending my statement which is all very well but again i am doing all the work i then spoke to my visa account people then were able to tell me i was being given a refund from comfort inn if mr haq had checked properly none of this would be necessary after hours i finally got to the bottom of this my time is very precious to me not pleased at all
