our suite was right by the breakfast room so there was a lot of noise when breakfast started our room shared a first door with something to do with the staff and they were banging the door from about am as we were below ground level we could hear the underground until it finished and then again from early in the morning check in is from and we arrived at and they were still cleaning our room i had a business meeting at and wanted to get changed but the cleaners were being awkward so in the end i had to just force my way in to use the bathroom to change we had paid for night and due to the brussels attacks we needed to stay another night when we asked at reception he was going to charge us for an extra night we also asked for a quiet room i went online to find the room was that night if i booked through booking com when we pointed that out he said he would do it for so we checked out and went elsewhere it is a nice place with good location and big rooms but we got hardly any sleep due to noise if you stay here tell them you don t want suite
