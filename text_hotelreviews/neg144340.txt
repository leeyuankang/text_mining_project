disappointed when we saw our room as it was a family room two normal singles and two child singles we specifically chose the hotel to have three equal single beds for three adults as we booked a triple room which looked nicer in the pictures but we didn t get into our room until past so just put up with it we were also lower ground so had no view we couldn t even see the weather to know what to wear the next day that said i was told the smaller bed was comfortable enough disappointed we couldn t have an earlier check in time as requested which meant we had to go out without seeing our room until the early hours the next day after the concert
