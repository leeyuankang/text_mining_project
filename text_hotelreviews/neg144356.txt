this was close to the smallest hotel room i was ever in the distance between the end of the bed and the wall was about there was nowhere to put our luggage and we travel with only carryon a big suitcase would have been a show stopper but my biggest gripe is about the desk staff the first morning we only had one towel eventually we found the other in the wardrobe the second morning there was only one towel and none in the wardrobe we told the desk about the problem and went out to breakfast came back no towel told them again and left for the day finally after telling them a third time someone in housekeeping left a towel on the bed how hard is it to go and get an extra towel and hand it to the guest
