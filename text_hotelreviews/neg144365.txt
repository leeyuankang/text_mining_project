the room was the smallest hotel room i have every stayed in not at all like the sizes shown in hotel literature the foot of the bed was so close to the wall that to get passed we had to turn sideways and slide through ducking to miss hitting head on the tv that is mounted on the wall at this point the bathroom was minuscule with a stuck plug in the sink which i fixed but it then let sewer smells into the room unhygienic and dangerous the toilet roll holder was positioned under the sink and was broken the shower was so small that any movement inside it sprung the door open flooding the floor and also caused user to hit temp control changing temperature dangerous when i reported the above it was met with indifference for the money this was a disgusting ripoff staying here spoilt our visit to london will never stay here again would definitely not recommend
