was disappointed reviews had been great but room very small for value very low bed no bathroom counter drains were slow sink drain broken and had terrible smell slimey no point saying anything as would have to move rooms defeats purpose of settling in after very long travel day with lots of luggage for weeks of travel this just should never happen rooms should be top notch upon arrival with all expectations met clean but not spotless
