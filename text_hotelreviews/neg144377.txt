described in the profile as elegant stylish and recently refurbished we were deeply disappointed to find the queens gate was none of that there was a bit of surface prettiness but in general the rooms were somewhat shabby and scuffed with a strange odor when windows were open the rooms vary in size some with lots of space but too little room to put away small items not a single drawer in the bedroom or bath we were adequately comfortable in our rooms but the queen s gate was too basic for our tastes a move was discussed but inertia and a full seven day schedule won out
