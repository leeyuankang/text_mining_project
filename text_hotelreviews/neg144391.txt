original booking payment mess up was very disconcerting considering we got upgraded for the inconvenience the room seemed no better than the average holiday inn rooms however i heard that the other rooms were likened to broom cupboards the room was very stark no floor coverings which meant the floor was slippery lighting switches most confusing not enough t bags only the coffee machine was too complicated and not appreciated a small cafeti re would be better or decent instant coffee no dressing gowns in the bathroom there was no where to put towels if using the bath or shower a towel rail to dry and hold towels would be useful in the foyer there was a smell of cigarettes breakfast food looked a little over cooked hard fried eggs
