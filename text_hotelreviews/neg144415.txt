had to move rooms at sunday morning as an intermittent vibrating noise like a hammer drill from an outside air conditioner made it impossible to sleep this was room and seemed to be a known problem with that room moved to room which was excellent breakfast somewhat chaotic as there was a lengthy wait for certain items like bacon scrambled eggs and sausages once all the items were available however it was a good breakfast
