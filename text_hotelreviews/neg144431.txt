i had booked a twin room for my mother and i on arrival quite late in the evening our twin room consisted of two single beds pushed together and made up as one double style bed i raised this with the receptionist on duty and asked if the beds could be separated which meant moving bedside tables lamps etc he looked in the room and abruptly told me that was a twin room he was not prepared to do anything about it as this was how twin rooms were in london and that i should look at the pictures on the website which displayed twin rooms as two single beds pushed together i informed him i had stayed in many twin rooms in london previously and this was not the case he again refused to do anything and left the room leaving us to try to separate then beds which was not possible due to the other bedroom furniture being secured in the way so i had to share the bed with my mum which was not what i had paid for or what we expected i checked the website and twin rooms are displayed as seperate beds i will not stay at this hotel again and if you want a twin room i would not stay at this hotel either
