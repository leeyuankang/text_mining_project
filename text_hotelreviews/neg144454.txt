when we arrived the lights in our room did not work several members of staff were involved and the process took about we were told there were other rooms available but they wouldn t relocate us after several trips to and from our room with all our luggage due to the confusion refusal of the maintenance guy to get involved one encounter with a rude member of staff and confusion over whether the free drink for the hassle included alcohol or not we were finally back in our room with working lights the hotel did then provide a fruit basket for the inconvenience however overall i felt they dealt with the whole experience very badly
