upon checkin we were offered a room on the fourth floor as we requested with twin beds and a quiet room when we got to the room we were overcome by the stench of faeces and one double bed even though upon checkin we discussed the twin beds and this was confirmed immediately we went back to reception as we could not bare the smell we were then given a room on the ground floor behind the bar as this was the only one available we did indicate this was going to be incredibly noisy which was the case during the night also the water was cold at checkout we expressed our disappointment to staff especially for the price we paid but there was no goodwill gesture offered i will definitely not be staying here again or recommend to anyone
