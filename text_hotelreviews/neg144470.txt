no complimentary water this was my third or fourth stay and i think the last instead of a welcome back and perhaps an upgrade i got a tiny room different than the specific floor i requested i was in town for one night and had forgotten my phone chargers staff couldn t help and more or less had a sort yourself out attitude until i sourced one which needed an adapter they let me use theirs while telling me twice that this is the staff s property and not the hotels
