i expected more from the family room the picture and room bookings made it sound like it was a room for four and not three with an extra bed squeezed i would expect more space and larger beds for the money even in london i feel the information was slightly misleading on booking com i asked another guest what they thought the pictures looked like and they said it looked like three double beds not three singles the staff were helpful and sorted the extra bed when we arrived
