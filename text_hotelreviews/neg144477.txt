we were disturbed overnight thursday friday early hours by two men presumably guests who spoke overly loudly in the corridor waking us up entered the adjoining bedroom where they proceeded to move furniture on a wooden floor causing more noise and continued their very loud conversation which we could plainly hear in our bedroom they then left the room banging the door only to return some minutes or so later repeating their previous behaviour very annoying and disruptive of our sleep therefore the efficiency of the sound insulation is questionable i mentioned the incident to the receptionist the following morning and requested that she have a word with our fellow guests there was no repetition of the disturbance overnight friday saturday the room s decor was tired and the window frame was rotten so needs attention only other disappointment was quality of coffee at breakfast and stale mini croissants
