pretty grim looking shower cubicle and shower head in room worked ok but not a pleasant experience needs replacing breakfast room needs a manager to direct staff and ensure that there is enough food available would also benefit from reorganising the layout of items available as it is not logical people were going backwards and forwards in a very small place to get what they wanted quite dangerous too food was good quality but we were disappointed by several empty containers and apparently no attempt to replenish just looked bad a wait to be seated sign might help as several people bypassed the log in desk as there was no one there it didn t feel like a per head experience
