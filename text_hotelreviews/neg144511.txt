room was loud from both street noise and noise from the corridor from both staff and other guests when you lifted the plug in the bathroom sink it smelled of sewage bed was not comfy at all very hard the thermostat controlled the air con unit but the radiator did what it wanted when people from other floors flushed toilets or had showers and when the heating came on and off we could hear the water running through the walls and pipes so not a good night sleep at all very expensive and massively needs updating
