i didn the like the laminate flooring it made the room feel functional rather than luxurious in any way there were drinks in the mini bar that we couldn t open as there was no bottle opener there wasn t one available so we had to go down to the bar to get the drinks open no one offered to come up the room could do with a lick of paint not much better than a travelodge disappointed overall
