breakfast was good lots of choice cereals fruit fresh orange juice toast etc the only slight disappointment was that the quite comprehensive hot breakfast on offer was not very hot in fact it was cool on our first morning this was a shame because it tasted very nice it was better the second morning when we were an hour earlier maybe it could be kept hotter for longer
