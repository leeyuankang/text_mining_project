inothing to do with hotel which was great but i was sure i booked a triple room with breakfast for me my wife and year old son for days whilst in london however when we arrived i was informed the booking was only for a twin room the hotel was very helpful and offered to put in another bed for my son free of charge but had to pay for his breakfast but the room was far too cramped for of us so i had to pay extra each night to upgrade and include breakfast for my son this may have been an error by me on the booking com website but i would not have purposely booked a twin room for people fairly annoying after a hour flight though
