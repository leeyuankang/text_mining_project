room if they offer it change it noisy room as it has hotel work yard and bar garden right outside drilling at and people talking very loudly until late with a kitchen fan directly under room that comes to life at not impressed booked a twin room and was given a triple after booking for two nights and being told they hadn t got one booking when i had spoken to hotel reception directly on phone i was told they were full and they seemed to shove us in this and that we may have to change rooms on night which had been booked since december staff were ok need more training i think phoned to ask them to book a taxi as it was pouring down and was told all the roads were closed and that i would be better off hailing one down outside not very professional i managed to hail one down in two mins but usually the concierge do this for you on checking out we weren t asked if we had enjoyed our stay and when we were in the middle of checking out the chap dealing with us answered the phone and left us standing there mid transaction another big no no in hotel etiquette felt totally let down could have stayed at a travel lodge for half the cost and had exactly the same experience breakfast is not worth either nothing special not even an offer of a pot of tea this review may sound a bit negative but when you are used to staying in hotels on london and get a dud you have to tell people
