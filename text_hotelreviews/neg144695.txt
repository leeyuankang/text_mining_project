our room was much too hot and despite setting the thermostat to and turning on the fan we couldn t get it to cool down the nice young man on the front desk came to our and quickly sorted things out starting by shutting off the radiator breakfast was rather uninspiring the buffet included churros and spanish tortilla neither of which i ve encountered before in uk hotels but no fried eggs the cocktails in the bar were very expensive and not very good
