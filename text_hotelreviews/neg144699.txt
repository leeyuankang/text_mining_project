the room was very small it was difficult to walk from one end of the room to the other because there is no room between the end of the bed and the table the cord on the kettle was so short you could not plug it in the electric socket behind the beside table was hanging off the wall the shower was very powerful but the space in the cubicle was non existent and although it was my daughters birthday they did not even wish her happy birthday which is in contrast to the time we stayed in the cumberland hotel in marble arch for my son s birthday where they not only wished him happy birthday but they sent him a platter of fresh fruit with a note wishing him happy birthday all in all a very disappointing experience
