the hotel is old the rooms are congested the windows are locked this makes you feel like your in a prison you hear all the noises from the corridor my room was exactly in front of the lift you can imagine i heard every footstep every conversation between people right from am all the way till it was a depressing experience the decor is completely sad something like a dracula movie the window kept banging because of the wind i don t mind noises but this was just terrible i couldn t sleep more than hours i checked in thinking i would stay for days i left the very next day there are much better hotels than this one for the same or less price i do not recommend this hotel unless you get a bigger room away from the elevator maybe
