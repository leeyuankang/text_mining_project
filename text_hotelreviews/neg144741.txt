the staff were fine or arrival but by no means the friendliest there is no restaurant only a bar the bar is fit for purpose but rather small and the tv was on the whole time not a great atmosphere cocktails over priced for the quality during our stay start of christmas season there was a big leak in the ceiling of the bar no mention of it nor apology we ate in the hotel which is ok for a snack look elsewhere if you want really decent meal
