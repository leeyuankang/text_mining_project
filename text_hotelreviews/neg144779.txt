on our first of three nights we discovered that the drain in the handbasin was blocked and waste water kept backing up the smell was abhorrent and the extractor fan in the bathroom was either not working or next to useless we were promised a repair the same day by the duty manager nothing was done and no information was forthcoming when we returned to the hotel at the end of our second day as the evening duty manager knew nothing of our problem he helped by giving us an alternative room and we had to move our possessions late in the evening wi fi was not working for out of our three days
