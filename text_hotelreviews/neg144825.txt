breakfast at per head was disappointing for this standard of hotel normally when paying this much we are offered the option a freshly cooked breakfast most disappointing was the smell of tobacco room which pervaded our room in the evening and early morning it resulted in a poor night s sleep on the second night we raised this with the receptionist on our departure and felt dissatisfied with the explanation that it was coming from next door s balcony it was definitely coming from inside our room possibly through the open vent in the ceiling near to the door
