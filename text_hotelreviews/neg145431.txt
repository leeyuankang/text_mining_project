no air conditioning and it was a very hot weekend there was a fan in the room which really helped but it couldn t be placed near the window so the air was still fairly warm also the kettle was awkwardly positioned the base was wired into the wall and the lead went up through a cupboard this meant you had to pull out a shelf to sit it on top of and the shelf wasn t flat so the kettle was boiling away precariously on a tipping shelf it didn t fall but was a bit worrying and wouldn t be great for someone with any difficulty using their hands the bath was very deep and having short legs was a challenge to step out of inadvisable for anyone frail the drinks at the bar were very expensive cheaper to walk outside to a pub so the bar wasn t very popular they could do with slightly reducing the prices to encourage more guests to use it the lift was extremely small people could stand in it at most and it was incredibly claustrophobic to use after using it twice we decided to walk up the stairs and three flights in hot weather was uncomfortable in the morning there was noise very early on from dustcarts and traffic and without air conditioning we had to sleep with the window wide open the road isn t a big one but there were some people on motorbikes and in cars who drove really quickly up it so watch out when crossing over
