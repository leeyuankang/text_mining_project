the room was called executive double room but was in fact really small that s fair enough but the bed was not more than cm which is too small for two adults the bed was also extremely hard unfortunately for this hotel there was a heat wave in london during this weekend and the rooms were not equipped with either ventilation nor ac so there were insanely hot in the room the room was equipped with a table fan but even with the fan on and the window open the temperature was around degrees in the room
