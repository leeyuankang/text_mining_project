i had requested an early check in only an hour before normal check in time we were left for nearly hours in the lobby just off reception and kind of forgotten about we were asked if we wanted to be transferred to a sister hotel in holborn i said i didnt due to all the amazing things i had planned in the area so the lady said she would be back in mins mins later a coach load of people were checking in and our day was cut shorter because i had to go looking for the lady who was dealing with us eventually we were able to check in the continental breakfast was pretty standard but you should be allowed a pot of tea in the morning not just one cup
