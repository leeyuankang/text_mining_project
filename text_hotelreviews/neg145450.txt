check in was and check out was am a bit early if you you are on holiday no late check out either not sure if other hotels have the same hour gap i may have not noticed it since everywhere i have stayed had atleast a check out time of noon or a sympathetic extension this was a firm no without even a explanation that the hotel was booked out or something like this
