the welcome was okay the room was very very small for two single beds we could hardly move around them there was only one bedside table positioned between the two beds with very little space to put two cups and saucers two glasses and personal bits and pieces the unusual hot drinks cupboard meant if you hadn t got all of the items you need to make the drink out of the drawer underneath it meant removing the kettle and closing it up again to access the contents the bathroom door was too small i guess and hit against a floor stop when you opened it making it a squeeze to get passed the protruding towel ring without either bruising your hip on the door handle or your thigh on the towel ring it is probably the smallest ensuite i have experienced there was a number of lights on the tv a box above it and the phone that lit up the small room and made it difficult to get to sleep reading other reviews i think we were possibly given the worst room in the hotel
