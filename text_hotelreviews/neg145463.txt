not sure how this hotel got stars rooms are very small and the carpet is old and better not to know when it has been cleaned last bathroom is so tiny you can not even turn around also extractor fan did not work and walls were mouldy also it was very cold in the room since the windows were not even double glazing although when sleeping under the blanket temperature was fine
