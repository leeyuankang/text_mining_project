i arrived and was told that my room wasn t available due to a maintenance issue other people waiting had the same issue i was told that they would relocate me to a better property in holborn it was actually st paul s but due to early meetings and needing to take quite a lot of luggage that wasn t an option i spoke to them three different times about this while they looked at options and was told there was no availability and therefore no choice it wasn t until i asked for my money back and said i would book around a corner which was available that they gave me a triple room upon checking in it looked like a plain old double room to me shocking behaviour really not only did they not tell anyone in advance what was going on they lied to me and the other customers that were with me
