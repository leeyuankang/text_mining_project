the booking said the room had a bath i made a note that i wanted a room with a bath my room had a shower however when i pointed this out the desk staff were excellent and within minutes i was in a room with a bath excellent although there was no air conditioning which i knew so is not a negative the sash windows were fixed so they could not be opened to set up a convection current which is a pretty good alternative most places with sash windows have this problem as they don t know how to work them properly that said a fan was provided and that did the same job if a little noisier
