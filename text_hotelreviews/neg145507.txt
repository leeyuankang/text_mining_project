check in room minutes and staff were inefficient and not friendly requested a twin room on a low floor and was given one on the floor they then changed it to the ground floor but this was a double on the third attempt we finally got a room the room was very small and the shower you could not close the door and stand in it so small no fan in the tiny bathroom and the whole room was so hot you could not bear to be in their too long the beds were extremely soft and uncomfortable not good for back sufferers to cap it all they pre authorised my debit card and i did not get my money credited back to my account for days even though we had paid by a different method on the day totally inefficient and poor service we would not stay again
