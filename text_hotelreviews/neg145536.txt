very small room paid extra for a larger room but was very disappointed stuck in a room at the back of the hotel could only just get round bottom of bed between desk and bed advertised as having mini bar no mini bar bit of a dated feel to bathroom spoke to staff to see if bigger room available was told no very intimidated to have staff members behind the counter was offered a possible room move after we got back from the theatre after i almost started crying not practical as we got back late and didn t want the fuss not the romantic time i had hoped for from this hotel
