room doors made a loud noise when closing it disturbed us every time people in other rooms nearby went in or out the key cards to make the elevator go and also open the room were a huge pain they kept malfunctioning no matter how we stored them i went through at least during our night stay this was extremely irritating when we returned late at night and had to keep going back to the front desk for new keys they need a better system so as not to annoy their guests
