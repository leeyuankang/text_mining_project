the photos of the rooms as advertised on booking are misleading the photos used for specifically our superior room turned out to be photos of suites our superior room was very different a o much smaller and completely different bathroom old the whole room interior was old outdated the paint in the windows was old and the door to our room could not even open completeley because a table was in the way the room was that small the whole hallway was also outdated and the elevators are the slowest elevators i have ever experienced when we complained about the room not matching the photos used on booking and therefore not being worth the money the hotel offered us an upgrade to the nicest suite they had for the next night this suite turned out to be on the first floor with as view the tkts ticket office for cheap theater shows and the cue in front of it we fealt like we were literally in the display window of a store no privacy whatsoever so we closed the curtains even though it was still day the suite turned out to be directly above the bar restaurant and at night it felt like they were playing the music from the bar restaurant in our room that loud eventhough it was a sunday night we had to call the reception twice and finally around midnight they shut down the music as said it was a sunday night and that was probably the reason why there was no music noise from the square but on fridays saturdays you will probably have a lot of noise we heard the noise on the floor in a room at the back of the hotel the night before
