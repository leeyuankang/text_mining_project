our room was the worst nights sleep i have ever had in a hotel room we use hotels a lot and travel extensively the noise from the street went on until in the morning followed by a half hour of comparative peace before the loud morning noises our windows were fully closed they should never book that room we felt conned we told reception when we checked out who said they would look into it and email me we have not had any feedback this can not be first complaint perhaps they give the very worst room to night stays
