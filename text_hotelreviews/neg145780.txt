a male member of staff entered the room without any warning without knocking to retrieve items used by previous guests in the minibar i asked the reception staff to remind staff to knock before walking in on guests and they weren t interested they didn t even ask for my room number it left me feeling really uncomfortable and uneasy in the room very disappointed
