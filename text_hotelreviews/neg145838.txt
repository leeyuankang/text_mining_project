the breakfast was not very good little choice and not everyone wants all the healthy foods especially if you are on a leisure break the hot buffet left a lot to be desired tomatoes tossed in with the beans as one example staff should keep a check on the hot buffet we didn t find a lot of the staff in the restaurant particularly helpful no one smiled felt pretty miserable really as if we were an inconvenience no where to sit in the evening if you just wanted a drink seats very minimal
