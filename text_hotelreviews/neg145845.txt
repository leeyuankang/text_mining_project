the bedroom was small with a double bed which felt like a small double although i admit to having a king size at home therefore from a five star would not expect it also the two chairs and round table in the bedroom was a trip hazed as there was no walking room from that side of the bed a person had to walk sideways the bathroom was lovely but also too small whereby if you were not forever treading on the doorstop when you tried to climb out of bath tub i nearly slipped trying to climb out as there was nothing to hold on to as the tub was high however make no mistake only a midget could take a bath in that tub powerful shower though this was my second stay but first stay was in a suite
