poor reception staff generally stern confused unfriendly upon arrival i was asked abruptly if i was pre checked to which i replied i don t know what that is i just arrived to check in i was also asked if i prefer to pay on check out to which i replied yes and then the reception lady said that i had to pay upfront and i didn t have a choice so why did she offer me the choice to begin with i had booked rooms as we were three traveling a single room and a double room had to explain this times i was told that breakfast wasn t included and i produced the booking document confirming breakfast was indeed included just a general feeling of cluelessness among the reception staff also the decor of this hotel is in need of refurbishment even if it is only a star hotel bland brown burgundy and beige it is depressing and old fashioned
