my a night room faced a brick wall with scaffolding up but was only staying the one night so didn t make a fuss as i was hardly in the room and the english breakfast was very disappointing although i was given it as a complimentary freebie i didn t complain but if i d had to pay the per person i would have most definitely complained the selection was good lovely croissants and pastries but my cooked breakfast was very poor i would stay there again but not eat the breakfast it s vastly overpriced and there s loads of places to eat right on the doorstep
