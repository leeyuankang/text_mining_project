on one side of the double bed there was a dip that my fianc kept rolling into like the mattress had been damaged the tap on the bathroom sink was not well positioned as every time you turned the tap on it splashed against the sink and you got soaked i paid for a room and the room was nothing special the bath area was not very clean there were still hair shavings that i had to rinse away before i had a bath
