in general the hotel was great unfortunately he did not have a very good meal in the evening he ordered a roast turkey meal but it arrived cold the vegetables carrots parsnips and roast potatoes were cold and the brussels sprouts were completely raw so while aspects of the hotel were great we would not recommend dining in its restaurant we did get a refund for the meal but it would have been better had it been edible to begin with
