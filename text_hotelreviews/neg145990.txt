we had dinner at the hotel but unfortunately the food did not live up to previous expectations couple of us had the soup which turned up in a metal mug also a couple of us had the steak and ale pie which i would say was pretty poor it was so dry and the pastry was very hard no gravy was offered certainly not fresh we have had meals there before and have been good but it was not what i would have expected from a top london hotel
