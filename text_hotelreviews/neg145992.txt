as i said it was great although the mini bar was expensive for a kitkat which took me by surprise but that is all i really have to quibble with also they do take a deposit of about incase you use the paid facilities ie breakfast mini bar and cocktail bar you can of cause pay for drinks separate you ll get the deposit back if you ve not used it just check your bill to make sure they have crossed it of
