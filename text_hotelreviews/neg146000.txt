the room was much smaller than i expected to was actually difficult to walk past the end of the bed as it was so close to the wall there is also a large building site next to the hotel which was operational at on saturday morning even though we were on the floor the noise was dreadful and you could feel the building shaking at times the cold tap on the bath could not be turned on
