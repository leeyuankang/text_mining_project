i specifically booked two twins on booking com a few hotels will allow you to specifically book two twins when we got there they gave us one double i frequently travel with my daughter and girlfriends and will only book hotels that will allow specific singles booking if i had known this request would not been honoured i would have never booked it further it appears hotels have the option to not allow specific twin bookings after being offered a king bed instead in the interests of making it right and while desperately trying to rebook a hotel room at pm on a saturday night in the west end of london whilst holding show tickets for and letting them know i was unimpressed i was offered two separate rooms and moved to a room with twins the next day that room directly faces a very active new construction site with jackhammering etc starting at on checkout i was asked if i was happy with my stay i said no at this point the concierge pointed out they had given me two rooms for the first night he continued to argue the point i should have been happy sorry i had a simple request two beds i did not want to have to panic on saturday night or move on sunday i did not need the stress at the end of a multiple hotel stay vacation to deal with this i did not want to be next to a construction site even at check in before offering two rooms the check in staff argued with me about the booking process and needing to phone and confirm this is the age of computers you know how many twin rooms you have don t sell what you don t have amend your parameters on booking com advertise you are located next to an active construction site
