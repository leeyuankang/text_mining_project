although it was a short walk i didn t like that the uber cabs couldn t pull up to the entrance of the hotel on the day i checked out there was also no porter to help with my luggage and i had to chug them down to the uber myself the staff at the reception said since he was alone there was no way he would leave his desk to help me tsk
