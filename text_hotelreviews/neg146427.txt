the property was like a las vegas hotel decor was opulent and tacky i usually stay in paris at boutique hotels but stayed here because we thought it would be nice for valentine s day i travel constantly and always in the most luxurious hotels the decor of this hotel was boring and i don t really love the neighborhood too commercial paris is so magical but this place makes it feel like you re in any other city also if you don t like perfume do not stay here the halls and rooms have so much perfume you can barely breathe definitely not worth the money
