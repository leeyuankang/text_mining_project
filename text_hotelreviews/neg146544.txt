terrible checking in process arrived at to the property and mentioned to that fact to the hotel prior to hand they decide to log me into a room that is in a different block had to walk with my luggage in the rain with an incompetent bellboy who was literally taking way too much time closing the umbrella before going in while i waited in the rain the other rooms are ridiculously far from the main property room was terrible ground floor and not clean hair in sink lobby light into the room too much noise and just a terrible experience asked to be moved and had to walk all the way back into the main hotel in the rain to be given a room grade which i initially booked it just seemed that at the middle of the night that was the only room available asked to speak to the manager which was not communicated until he saw me checking out and asked about my stay overall would definitely not recommend the hotel for future stay as there are tons of other hotels in london that offer proper services at equivalent prices including other star hotels
