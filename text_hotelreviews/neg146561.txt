the room was tiny and the bathroom even more so london hotel rooms are never large but this was very small the mini bar was not restocked during my stay even after pointing this out to reception this required me to call room service checkout was one of the most painful experiences of my life lots of clueless people stood around looking useless of my pet hates in hotels no iron and ironing board in the room i don t want to phone for one and then wait mins for it to arrive this is acceptable in a hotel or a travel lodge but not a the second is no sockets next to the bed which means your phone and alarm is charging on the other side of the room i don t know why hotels design rooms so badly personally i would save some money and book in a premier inn the service and room would be better
