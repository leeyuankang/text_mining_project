i didn t like the fact that it was so small the facilities were in the bigger sister hotel across the road i actually thought i had booked in there to be honest very small room and bathroom would be unsuitable for anyone that may be on the larger size the breakfast although complimentary was very weak so i m sure it s not the first time someone has mentioned this lacked atmosphere really friendly manager guy though he was very helpful when we arrived leaving fruit and water to the room he is one of two positives his service and the hotels location which is excellent
