not a star hotel the room they put us in first was on floor had a tiny window facing an alley where staff smoked and had coffee the room was so tiny we couldnt move around were very disappointed and asked to be moved were moved to the floor the day after in a much better room no bathrobes and no extra toilettries as is expected from a star probably the poorest breakfast buffet i have experienced
