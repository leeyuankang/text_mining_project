the i guess understandably for central london compact and bijou room was very badly impacted by noise from rooms on both sides trust me i m not a moaner and most of my feedback on this site is positive we had television sound booming through our headboard wall and an adjoining door on the other wall until am am respectively on both nights it wasn t the other guests being bad you could barely hear their tv in the silent corridor but the wall was like a low frequency sound box and the door might just as well have been a japanese screen noise insulation wise the rooms are thus expensive and yet badly insulated to say the least star at start rates in many ways but class in others i got a deal through booking com that meant i only paid per night but that s a lot for poor sleep on each night imho if we got a basket case room because it could have been nearly per night according to the website i question the booking com proposition
