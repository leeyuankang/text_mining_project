several points tv facility in the room stopped working after only minutes and having contacted staff i was told there was a fault with the system they didn t know when it would be fixed this meant that my staff for one night wasn t off to a great start as i couldn t even watch the tv to unwind from a long day the light surrounds for the ceiling spotlights seemed to be loose as if ready to fall away the lock barrel spindle on my side of the door appeared to be exposed missing a back plate as if it may have been faulty this didn t do much to reassure me of the lock working room security privacy the mirror on the wall appeared to be cracked i brought all of this to the attention of a staff member who came to the room to check the tv when i first reported this fault i believe this may have been the hotel s general manager i was told all of these points were fine the next morning when i checked out i received a verbal apology from the desk staff only when i specifically reiterated the above points no refund on the bill it s very disappointing to pay around for a night at a apparently upmarket hotel townhouse and not receive the service stay you paid for i did write to the company at their registered address three weeks ago and no reply disgraceful anytime i am in london again i will definitely not stay at any of their hotels
