the saga starts at check in although they had charged my credit card for the entire stay prior my arrival which is ok as i chose non refundable booking option they tried to force me to sign an old traditional payment slip on top when i refused they said they would not let me in to my room although they took my money for it after half an hour of nerve recking quarrel i managed to get into my room then comes the part where it becomes an issue for the trading standards office the hotel is listed as a star hotel but it is no more than a b b the pictures of the rooms i booked deluxe double have nothing to do with the actual one i had to stay in when challenged the front desk i was told the pictures on the site were of executive doubles and they get complaints often with no regret
