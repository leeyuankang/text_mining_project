the booking com listing and hotel s web site descriptions make the property more upscale than it is it s a nice property but not a star property the walls around my room were paper thin could clearly hear conversations in neighboring rooms snoring nose blowing etc and there was very little space to move around in even by european hotel standards that said the bathroom was spacious odd lighting but great shower heads
