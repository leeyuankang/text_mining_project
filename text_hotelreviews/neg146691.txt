the reception staff seemed to lack basic knowledge and skills on arrival i was told our original room had been changed due to the previous occupants having smoked in it however the room we were give was very small and despite running the air con at degrees for ninety minutes it still remained freezing cold the bathroom also only had half a toilet roll in it no spare and when we asked for non feathered pillows we were told the hote had run out of them and would need to borrow some from the other hotel nearby we were offered another room but when we were taken to see it the staff quickly informed is that we couldn t have it as it was subject to maintenance and smelt of damp we were finally given room which whilst warm obviously hadn t been cleaned that day as there was a layer of dust all over the surfaces breakfast the next morning was also slightly shambolic as we needed to keep asking for basic items coffee butter etc on checkout it then took three members of staff to work out how to take part payment given that they had already pre charged my card this was a real shame as i have stayed in this hotel previously and also in its sister hotel across the road late last year both times having no issues perhaps this was just an unlucky stay but it makes me question using this hotel again despite it being so convenient for work and leisure
