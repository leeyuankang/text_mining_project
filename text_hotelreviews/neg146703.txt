the main thing we didnt like was the smallness of the room and the noise and talking form the hall and other rooms were disturbing there werent any view the room was dark and the smell in the room was too intensive the bed was uncomfortable for conclution the location and friendly staff was the only thing we liked about the hotel for that price we expected more
