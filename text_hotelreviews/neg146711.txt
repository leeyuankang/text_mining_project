our room was downstairs and once you went through the fire door there was an unpleasant musty smell the floor has subsided in places both in the hall and room so when you step on it your foot sinks the room itself was stuffy and the air conditioner didn t work so we opened the windows this was great but there was no security on the windows and they were at ground level
