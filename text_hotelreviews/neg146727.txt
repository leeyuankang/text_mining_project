room was in a separate building across the street from the main hotel so not really any facilities unless you go to main hotel first single room in the basement smelled terrible due to sewer issues next door staff upgraded me to a double room ground floor which is nice of course but also pretty normal in these circumstances bed linens where dirty brown stain and bloodstains and have to be changed even for a double room pretty small though but as i was alone i don t care about it staff was really nice and helpful but won t book it again
