the man at the reception asked me several times whether i was alone or with a person i was alone in the room however there was a friend with me at the reception whom i was going to go to dinner with having booked a double room i cannot understand the irritating insistence when i came back at pm the hotel door was closed a sign read will be back in minutes in a four star hotel this is not acceptable this design hotel chose to replace closets with wooden crates fine but why using the hookless coat hangers the antitheft ones plastic glasses in the bathroom are a cheap option the desk is too small to work on no free bottled water
