we had a duplex upstairs bedroom with tv desk and double bed there was no light over or near the desk so hard to see tv channels are of course all in french and as tv is integrated into a wall we were unable to plug in a usb or laptop to watch english progammes the main issue though is that the air conditioning just didn t work and the upstairs bedroom particularly was unbearably hot and we just couldn t sleep up there we advised reception daily and each day they tried to fix it and on the last day got a technician but it still wasn t fixed we were not offered another room or a fan our booking said large double bed upstairs and a double bed downstairs for our adult daughter it wasn t a double bed but it was a pull out couch in what was supposed to be a lounge there was no room to move at all once this was pulled out with a coffee table and chair we had to climb over furniture to get to the bed which was most uncomfortable no tv in the downstairs area the downstairs was dark and lighting was appalling we ended up leaving the bathroom and wardrobe lights on in order to see it was a shame really as the staff were lovely and it could have been okay they need to fix the air conditioning and move customers when they can t they need to fix the lighting have light bulbs that actually provide some decent light and then they will have a very good hotel
