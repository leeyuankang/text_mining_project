unfortunately we were put in the wrong room when we arrived which was a smaller cheaper room than what we had paid for we noticed this when comparing with the pictures of the rooms online although the situation was rectified once we brought it to the receptionists attention the way it was managed did give a sense like this was a deliberate mistake as we were made to feel like they had done us a favour by putting us into the correct room
