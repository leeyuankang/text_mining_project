we came at for breakfast and the tables were dirty no clean cups available no orange juice anymore we needed to ask for everything disappointing as this was the last thing we did in the hotel before leaving and that is what you remember tiles in the entrance are clean but are weared out they need to be replaced because they leave a dirty look though they are certainly clean
