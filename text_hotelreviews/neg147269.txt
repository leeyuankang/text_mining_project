my room design was inconvenient as the bedroom was on a mezzanine level above the bathroom and living room separated by a spiral staircase could be fun for some but a pain if you need to visit the bathroom at night also as heat rises the bedroom was too hot and the living room and bathroom too cold my colleagues rooms were fine so just check what you are getting if you want to avoid this
