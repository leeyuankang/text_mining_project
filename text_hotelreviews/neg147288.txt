the doors in hall are not on controlled hinges so every morning i would hear them slamming every minutes which was extremely noisy and disappointing it made it difficult to relax in my room in the mornings and a big shame as i was in paris for work this would be a big issue for me next time when booking it would be nice to have tea and coffee facilities in the room
