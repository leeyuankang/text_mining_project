the staff of this hotel were simply horrible i ve never encountered such poor service at a hotel not to mention at a star hotel they were rude and their service was absolutely horrible for example on the night i asked them to bring me another blanket because it was chilly on that day but they refused to do so they simply told us they cannot do it in the evening do they not have a spare blanket on the and nights they took our blankets and didn t leave one i had to call them and fight to get a blanket the lady who was on the front desk was absolutely snotty and rude she even scolded me for not telling them sooner we were touring lovely paris during the day how could have we been able to do that during the day the room is very small and nothing worked as it should for example the hair dryer overheat every seconds so i had to cool it down for minutes after second use it took me minutes to dry my short hair the shower was horrible too this hotel was the worst aspect of our trip to paris avoid this hotel like a plague don t trust other good reviews this is a horrible hotel
