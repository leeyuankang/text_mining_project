it would be nice if the hotel could put up a more noticeable sign that we could see from the main road it wasn t fun for an year old lady to have to walk back and forth just to find the entrance also personally if the swimming pool isn t so functional please don t advertise about it to me it was like you re cheating the customers to have a proper pool you need to have a proper changing room with a shower for both sexes guests should not be expected to change in the toilet
