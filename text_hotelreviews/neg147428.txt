breakfast was a bit of a joke for the price the scrambled eggs were like soup bacon undercooked etc the wait staff on that floor is lackluster as well we were asked the first time if wed like drinks and we ordered them and never saw them again second time down they didnt even approach us until a manager finally realized we were done and brough the check mind you we dont fit the bill appearance wise as those with wealth so we are used to this kind of service dont judge a book by its cover
