we were unfortunately caught up in the terrorist attack on london bridge and the duty manager on the night was absolutely awful and offered us no help whatsoever in fact he was dismissive and rude we were stranded outside of the hotel and could not gain access all we asked was whether they could send our baggage home if we made our way to waterloo as we had nowhere to go or stay to which he responded if you leave london without your baggage it is at your own risk not what you d expect in such a situation from a hotel that is obviously aimed at the luxury market the cocktails in the bar were super expensive but very poor in quality i accept cheap and poor or expensive and amazing
