our bed was not made so when we went out we ask that it be changed from two doubles into the super king which it should have been in the first place when we got back the bed was not done i called down and they sent someone up to do it which left us feeling very awkward sitting in our room watching them make the bed not the sort of service you expect to be forgotten about in a high end hotel
