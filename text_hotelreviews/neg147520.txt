very disappointed with our evening meal at the ting my chicken was very pink and when i told the waiter it took him mins to get back to me that the chef agreed and he would do me another one but by then my husband was almost finished with his main course so i didn t bother to eat a main course as i didn t want to eat alone but my husband ended eating alone anyway the service was extremely slow and poor and no apologies for the uncooked chicken really disappointed and upset as this was a birthday treat for my husband
