unfortunately someone was able to charge drinks and food to my room the charge was taken when i checked out thankfully i noticed and alerted someone at reception my money was refunded but it makes me wonder how someone managed to charge over worth of alcohol and food to a room that wasn t the same number as to the one i was staying in
