the charges for mini bar items was prohibitive for very basic products i don t like using the word rip off but this is the only word that accurately represents my genuine position when we arrived there was a wedding party in the main reception area this wasn t a problem but when we went for dinner in the restaurant in the lobby area later in the evening we waited over an hour for our dinner to be served and were advised by the restaurant manager that the delay in the serving of our meal was due to delays in the kitchen attributed to the wedding function this is a star establishment and the wedding was likely to be booked many months in advance and therefore one would have expected that the required number of kitchen staff would be on hand to ensure the guests in the hotel together with the guests attending the wedding function would have been adequately catered for on the third night my companion and i ordered tea coffee and scones again in the lobby restaurant area we were sitting at a low table and his knee accidentally hit the table and his entire cup of coffee spilled over the waiter enquired if he wanted a replacement coffee and he ordered another we were then charged for the extra coffee on top of for scones as stated above the only word that i can honestly use to describe the experience is rip off we paid for a night stay which was the equivalent of a recent trip to dubai including return flights transfers and full weeks board stay at a star hotel our stay at the shard was to mark a special occasion and regrettably our lasting impression was fabulous but not worth the money rip off
