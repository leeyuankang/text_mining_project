breakfast breakfast at ting on monday nov was a bit of a joke if you open a restaurant for breakfast at then everything should be ready for the customer on monday nov when i arrived for breakfast at about i had to ask for a certain bread which the day before had been out ready however it still took over minutes for the bread to arrive how can it take minutes to simply bring out a loaf there were also other items missing on the buffet also there was no hot self service buffet breakfast rather you had to place an order with a waiter this did not work as not only did it take too long for the hot food to arrive but when it did a couple of people i was traveling with had the wrong order given to them and the food wasn t hot basically prior to monday nov breakfast seemed to work well and as they say if it ain t broke don t fix it simply all you need is a hot and cold buffet breakfast and let the customer get on with it themselves and just let the staff bring the tea coffee and clear the tables and check on the hot cold buffet if it needs replenishing and that is it however for some unknown reason there seemed to be a lot of staff buzzing around but what they are all actually doing is anyone s guess
