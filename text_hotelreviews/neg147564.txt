long wait at check in has to wait to be seated for dinner even though it was booked for and we turned up at had a seat by the window but they put us next to the waiters service area so had different waiters coming and going all the time check out time valet bought the wrong car so had to wait longer than we would have liked but all in all it was good make sure you have a big enough budget before going though
