the swimming pool was a huge disappointment one changing room so you had to take the lift through the hotel in your robe when i say one changing room there was room in there for two people max to change and everyone else had to wait outside inside the pool area was basic just one small cold pool no jacuzzi no steam room no sauna highest pool in europe yes but that s about it
