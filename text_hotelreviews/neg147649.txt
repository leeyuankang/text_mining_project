having to wait hours for our room to be ready although we requested an early check in got there at normal check in is at and even then it wasn t ready finally got our room but was very disappointed as we didn t get none of our requests this was a birthday surprise also we then had to wait another hour to get the room we actually requested although you would have thought we would have got that room in the first place due to us having to wait hours anyway as they apparently had to get our room ready
