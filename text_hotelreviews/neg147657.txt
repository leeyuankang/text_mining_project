i didn t like ting restaurant was not happy as it was my fianc birthday and i d asked before the in the dinner area i have a table with view they didn t stick to what they agree with me this i was not happy with think it s over price for what we had the managers are great they try there hardest to keep you happy but i can safely say i will not be dinning in ting again unless they offer a free dinner then i will see if it s better
