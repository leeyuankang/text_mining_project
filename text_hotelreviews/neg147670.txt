staff very busy and rushed especially at breakfast we didn t feel very relaxed we had to ask for tea and coffee twice as they forgot our order food came out cold we were expecting excellent food and service for the money it cost but was very disappointed we ordered cocktails and open sandwiches in the bar so over priced i feel like we were paying for the views the hotel had to offer rather than a wonderful experience overall very disappointed will not be returning
