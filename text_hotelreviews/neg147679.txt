had a lunchtime reservation in the ting for a table of the service was rather slow to say the least didn t expect to have to ask for the wine list in such an establishment surely even if it was a busy service there would be enough staff to cater for customers needs despite this the food was very good and when we were served staff were helpful again slow to serve in the cocktail bar all very nice however a prompt service would make the experience a better one
