the hotel is only as good as the staff running it and the experience was terrible at a considerable cost and many complaints i would not recommend this hotel to anyone i have complained to the management and been offered a meal to compensate as they cannot turn the clocks back this was the third and final visit after such a disappointing stay and response from management and a very expensive ruined week end i can only hope that my review will deter others from experiencing similar situations
