we had a premier king room with city view the adjoining room had an uninterrupted view into our room of the complete bed area which could only be blocked by lowering the blinds over half the windows the tv is on a wall at the side of the bed located beyond the end of the bed there is a free basket of pieces of fruit the plums were damaged rotten on their base lunch in the restaurant ting was pleasant and enjoyable the staff and not up to standard they left large trays of used plates glasses etc sitting on stands beside the tables in front of us to our right and left one waiter was giving another an impromptu lesson on pouring wine generally they were disorganised we were out for dinner and a show having asked the receptionist when the bar was open to she said until the gong bar is on level there are more levels above for private flats and the viewing platforms when we arrived at our way into the bar was physically blocked by a waitress who said they had taken last orders at but if we wanted a beer or glass of wine they could serve that i asked if we could come into the bar she allowed us in we sat down at the window near the bar which was covered with dirty glasses i told the waiter that i wasn t happy as we had been told the bar was open until he got his bar manager who said it was company policy to close at on sunday he offered a free drink which we accepted after there is nowhere in the hotel for a resident to get a drink unless they go to their bedroom and use room service this was my first experience of such bad service and staff in a hotel in any previous occasions when i had a problem it was followed up the management personally irrespective of whether it was minor or not
