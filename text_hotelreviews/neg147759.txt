i feel the one negative of the shangri la and i don t know if this is because it is part of a large group of hotels is that i think it lacks the personal touch of other good hotels such as the berkely or langham e g putting little touches in the room such as a card chocolates cake or even a bottle of champagne in the case of the berkely which makes it feel that little bit more special
