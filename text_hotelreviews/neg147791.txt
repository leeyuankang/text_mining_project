when we arrived there was a problem with the booking system so a room hadn t yet been allocated to us this meant waiting when we arrived in our room the lady demonstrated the blinds but they weren t working so someone from engineering had to come up and fix them also because a room hadn t been allocated the birthday cake for my partner that the staff had assured me would be there wasn t there which took away from the wow factor when entering the room for me luckily i managed to get the staff to sneak one in whilst we were in the swimming pool there were also minor niggles such as ring marks from cups on the marble surfaces and the nespresso machine stopped working just before we left the room to go home the above were things that just took away from that truly star service especially when you re paying for one night
