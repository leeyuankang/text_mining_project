walking in through the ground floor i did not feel that the concierge was very interested in me i am just an ordinary person and obviously not wealthy like some of the travellers who stay there and as a result when i went out for my run i was ignored had to open my own door and was almost pushed out of the way by the concierge attempting to get the chinese lady into her taxi however reception staff were the opposite so not all bad they made me feel very special
