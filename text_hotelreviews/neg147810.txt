a member of concierge staff needs more training his attitude made me feel uncomfortable also if you guys open presents for security check then please close them like they were and inform the guests that you ll be opening present before hand one of my present was a chocolate champagne bottle from thorntons which was melted so never got delivered that s a loss of and all i was offered was a question whether i told concierge it needed to be in fridge or not still these are minor things i m only stating to help improve your standards otherwise it was next to flawless
