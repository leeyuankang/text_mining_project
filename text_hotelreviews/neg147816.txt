i didn t like that our room wasn t as high up in the sky as it could ve been my son didn t like his late night pasta but i loved my mushroom lasagna at breakfast their was no ice for drinks and our plates weren t cleared away quick enough to make us feel welcome to get another plate i really wanted to try some breads with salmon maybe some cheeses the fruits but all i had were the eggs and as usual my son wanted to leave he is not a breakfast person
