some staff were not as polite as i would expect for a hotel each time we entered the hotel we were asked whether we were staying in the hotel this is owing to public access to the gong bar on the floor although understandable annoying when a resident system of sitting near the window in the gong bar it seemed a little confusing and guests don t have priority disappointing considering the price of the room
