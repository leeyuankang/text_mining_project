only one small lift and used by house keeping so had to wait for a time to travel to the floor nespresso coffee machine in the room but no coffee pods offered deluxe room but was very small ants in the bathroom in our last day i would not rate this hotel a star and based on paying per night exc breakfast i feel the bubbles hotel is over rated far more other hotels in the saint germaine area to capture the same rate no parking which we knew at time of booking and min walk to nearest car park
