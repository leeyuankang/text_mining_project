it dissapointed us that it had a good rating in booking com there were several things we did not like the bathroom smelled horrible at night i do not know if they had a plumbing problem the air conditioner was not working if you took a shower the entire bathroom floor would get wet so if you wanted to get ready afterwards or use the toilet there was no way of doing it without getting wet they provide you with slippers the horrible thing about this is that they are very slippery in the bathroom my mom actually fell at her age this is extremely dangerous when we informed the receptionist she appolagized but not very interested in letting the client know that they would try and do something about that issue the bedside table is almost a dolls bedside table it is super small mesures like i would put mu bottle of water my mobile wi fi device and when i put my phone something would fall off you can see that on the picture i uploaded they have rooms outside the hotel they gave us one of those rooms so to get to the reception you would have to step outside to be able to get there the weather was very cold so this was vert uncomfortobale there is practically no place to put your things in the bathroom nor in the bedroom for people staying more tham two days this can be quite annoying not what we expected from the reviews nor what they offered we had very good experience in our other reservastions prior to this one it was just disspointing that our las stop for our vacation ended up in this place
