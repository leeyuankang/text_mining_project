our room seemed to have some electrical problems likely due to all of the fun decorations features that they added to the room for example the multitude of light switches for the bathroom seemed to have a different function each time they were used sometimes the lights would not even come on the jets for the bath tub did not work and the switch to raise and lower the television from the footboard of the bed did not work properly it would raise but not lower however this is not that different than one would expect from driving a french made car
