let s start from the beginning i asked the staff to provide me with a directions but instead of that i received an offer of using a shuttle bus for eur only nothing else when i arrived it turned out that the room was very small i understand that it s tricky to convert such an old building into a hotel but in this case the rooms should be arranged in a practical and funcitonal way closet was to close to the bed so we couldn t open it properly in the bathroom except small shelf under the mirror there was no counter top or any other place where we could place our cosmetics or even soap the shelf in the shower cabin was very unstable and it will fall on someone s foot sooner or later i asked for two separate twin beds but it turned out that the twin beds were very narrow and in fact joined together so in fact it was one bed immediately after arrival i told the reception that our pillows were stained and asked to replace them and i was assured that it would happen instead of replacing cleaning service just put them the other side up i asked for additional towels because for two people we got only towels towels were delivered but they disappeared after few hours despite the fact that they weren t used and they were folded on the bed i guess cleaning service took them breakfast was very bad i d expect a star hotel to offer a range of hot breakfast meals instead of that we were offered with non edible cold and dry scrumbled eggs and soaked bacon person serving breakfast didn t speak english so it was difficult to communicate corridors were constantly blocked by vacuum cleaners laundry laying on the floor or some other stuff in general the hotel is ok but it s not a star standard
