found the parking prices a little misleading and a misleading quote on wine tray charge think it almost shows that its misleading so you don t realise your being charged which is a shame like making sure you read the small print very boldly says free valet parking then further down car parking payable at about per day but for a not seasoned traveller i just read free parking maybe have the price and free valet parking in the same section the wine in the room that is outside of the fridge you could wonder if it was a small free bottle of wine the business card with it shows something free but when reading properly its free tray charge should you want a different bottle of wine
