bed was hard as a rock shower was a bathtub with a hand held so you had to hold it with one hand above your head set it down then soap up then pick it up and hold it above your head so much for fixed shower heads room was very tiny if your going to have a room that tiny at least have a bed i can slide my bags under instead i have to climb over my bags to get to the bathroom they advertise spa but the facilities cost extra and the steam room didn t work we ran out of toilet paper and the maid didn t replace it we had to go ask for more our key card didn t work twice we had to go to the front desk for a reprogram the elevator was to small could only hold max two people so when we were trying to leave we had to wait trips because the elevator kept clogging to the top to pick up people first
