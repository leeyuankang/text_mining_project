we were charged twice for taking water from the room or from the breakfast area we never took any of the water i am not sure what was going on here the person cleaning the rooms should check the number of bottles in the refrigerator but i guess they saw a bottle of evian on our desk bought at a convenience store and decided to charge us the front desk removed the charges after asking us about it though so that was good otherwise great location and good place to stay
