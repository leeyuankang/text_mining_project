the lack of a decent hairdryer for guests was a real surprise i had been travelling for weeks and this was the only establishment that did not provide a portable hair dryer instead the dreadful old fashioned drying hose stuck to the bathroom wall was the only option a staff member very kindly brought in her hair dryer for me to use during my day stay so please take note purchase a couple or hairdryers for use by guests who request them it really is not good enough to only provide those ghastly old fashioned wall dryer any more
