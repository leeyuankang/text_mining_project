i didn t like the manner the manager from the lobby spoke to me when i informed her about dirty sheet she said it is just impossible i said that unfortunately it is possible and showed her the picture i made she said no it is just wet but it wasn t wet it was just dirty i don t like the idea when the manager doesn t believe me and i need to spend my time trying to prove that there is a mistake finally she believed my words and apologized for this but i was dissatisfied as the whole dialog was unacceptable
