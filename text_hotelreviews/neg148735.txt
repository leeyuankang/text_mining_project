bedbugs contamination and failure to proceed to agreed refund contamination punaises de lit et refus de proc der au remboursement promis unfortunately i was bitten by bedbugs during my night stay at hotel academie at the end of august i was able to prove it having found insects and cocoons in the bed in the morning the receptionist agreed to a full refund for my first night stay giving me a refund receipt and indicating that a bank transfer would be formalised when her manager gets back after my departure hotel academie recently sent me an email informing me that they refuse to implement the refund they argue that i have implicitly rejected this proposal when i agreed to stay at the hotel though in another room which i had previously inspected and which did not appear to be contaminated for the second night of my pre paid reservation not only was the room i slept in the first night infected luxury room with spa but i am being denied a refund which was agreed to and put down in writing in exchange for the inconvenience this is very bad practice and service i therefore find it important to inform future customers j esp re sinc rement que les chambres contamin es seront trait es par des professionnels et que les autres clients affect s par la situation recevront un traitement juste et appropri dans les circonstances
