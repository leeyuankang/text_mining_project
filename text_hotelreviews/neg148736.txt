clearer descriptions about breakfast options would have been good we thought we chose the continental breakfast only to find out the hot breakfast option was the only one that included the cheese and cold cuts of meat after choosing the cheese and cold meat we were charged the hot full breakfast although we didn t select any of the hot food also our tea or coffee wasn t replenished through each day s cleaning with only satchels each of the coffee and tea at the start of our stay these were not adequate for our night stay
