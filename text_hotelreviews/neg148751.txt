man at reception on weekend made offensive accusations about my credit card and barked threateningly and delayed my departure unreasonably when the hotel s malfunctioning credit card scanner was to blame my card was immediately accepted when the number was entered manually his behavior was unacceptable also the room s heat source is oddly located inside the closet it wasn t a significant issue in late spring other than potentially dangerously overheating a goretex jacket there was a small hole in the duvet cover reception did not warn me when i arrived that the room safe had been removed for repair
