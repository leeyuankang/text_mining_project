we were there for nights which i booked months in advance which was a big mistake while we were there i checked online and i could have got my first night for nearly half the price i paid and on the other nights they were priced cheaper than we paid not at all happy about that the bedrooms are very small and too be honest we got more space on a basic cabin on a cruise ship we travelled on recently
