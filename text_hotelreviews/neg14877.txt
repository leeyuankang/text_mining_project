service in the coffee lounge near reception we ordered scones with cream and jam we waited for almost minutes and when they arrived they were inedible they had clearly been warmed through in a microwave and were of a bready texture when we mentioned this to the member of staff he just said sorry they are made upstairs i really resented paying for a terrible product which does not represent the hotel very well
