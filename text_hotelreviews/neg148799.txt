the shower s automatic drying feature was annoying because one time it randomly came on in the the middle of me still taking a shower and i therefore had to stand in the cold for minutes until it finished its cycle also getting into and out of the shower was slightly problematic because the tub walls were so high while this was only a minor quirk for me i m sure older travelers may have more issues with this
