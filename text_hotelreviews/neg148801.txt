staff weren t great one of the staff told us we could make our own cups of tea if we provided our own tea bags when my mum went to do this a different staff member told her off for using the kettle i stayed there for nights with my elderly mother and she only had that cup of tea for the whole time we were there as the staff weren t very helpful or approachable towards us for what we paid i would expect to be treated respectfully
