booked for a concert at the but the concert got cancelled and there was no way of cancelling without full payment for the room they offered to move the room to the rescheduled concert date but i can t attend on that date and wasn t offered anything else so ended up staying here if you aren t visiting the it s somewhat isolated from london if you are then it s perfect
