there was no bbc news channel other than french spoken channel we reported to the staff that told us the engineer had checked our room we couldn t get bbc channel in our room because the location of our room the staff didn t think an alternative way to solve the problem which i found slightly disappointed i do stay in the paris for holiday watching tv isn t a big issue however i do like to know what s going on in the world early in the morning before i get out of the door especially all the disasters have happened in paris recently i do recommend the hotel to solve the tv problem out for foreign travellers
