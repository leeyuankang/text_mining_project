the room given had a adjoining door so i could hear everything next door including very loud music and a lot of moaning and screaming fro to of an intimate nature the occupants are entitled to that but my room wasn t fit for purpose i did complain about the former problem and eventually the music stopped the second problem i thought it futile on checking out very early and recounting this problem to the reception staff i was offered a coffee couldn t wait to leave to get some sleep at home
