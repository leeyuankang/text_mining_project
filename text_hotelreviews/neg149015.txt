check in was completely chaotic the staff started helping someone else midway through and left us waiting there were no room key cards left so we had to wait for more the staff did not seem professional at all the room was in the basement along a warren and took ages to find from reception there was no phone signal and the wifi didn t work at all there were bright lights on the door settings which couldn t be turned down the room was clean but the carpets and decor are cheap and worn out i would never stay here again
