the hotel needs a concierge and the front desk staff could use some retraining i needed to receive some advice on getting a train from euston station to mgm s harry potter studio the first front desk clerk told me he would print directions and send them to my room after hours without directions i went to the front desk and was working with a woman and she asked me to step aside so she could help another customer i thought that was rude and disrespectful i asked to speak with a manager and was told the manager does not work on weekends i asked to have the manager speak with me when he came in and i never heard from one bottom line i ended up calling euston station and getting the answers i needed we had a great family vacation in london but i would expect a basic level concierge service for the fee we were paying to stay i would certainly return to london but i would not stay here again
