i stayed here for a recent short business trip to london for nights prior to a vacation in europe on the second night i was itching but couldn t pin down the cause well night i woke up to a bed bug in the bed i took a picture of the bug and decided to see if there were more which i found on the mattress along the headboard something i had read about where they like to hide i complained to the front desk and showed them the pictures they dealt with it by being apologetic and offering me a free breakfast management said they d need to get a report from the pest control before any further action was taken i believe in giving people a fair chance to rectify the situation which unfortunately wasn t the case in this instance instead of following up promptly i had to email them and ask whether the report was filed i also had the huge inconvenience of having to launder all my clothes and spray out my suitcase on vacation for fear that the bugs got in there not only did they confirm that yes in fact they did find live bed bugs but basically that they can t identify the cause and basically insinuated that it could ve been my fault i was absolutely appalled by the treatment and lack of customer service no fault to the front desk staff but how management dealt with this was appalling
