i booked and paid extra for the club room as it gave access to the club lounge every other club lounge i have been in offered food and free drinks including alcohol and this was what i expected unfortunately this club lounge turned out to be a very small room with a coffee machine with no coffee in a facility to make a cup of tea and a few other things i was very disappointed and felt i had been misled i would not have paid extra for this room had i been aware of what little was offered for the extra money on the website of other hotels in this group the club lounge looks worth the extra money but people should be made aware that this is certainly not the case with this particular hotel
