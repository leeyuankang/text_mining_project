on arrival we were informed that the cost was over higher than that on my confirmation from booking com it had to be discussed with the manager before it was agreed we could pay the lower cost the rooms weren t ready and on returning we were told that we had been given a complimentary upgrade these proved to be rooms in the sub sub basement with a window with a strip light behind it and curtains so you felt as if you were in a proper room not floors underground on querying what room we had actually booked superior we were told that we have been moved to their largest rooms and we couldn t have our original booking as they hotel was full having said that once the curtains were closed the room was fine the tea and milk was not replaced the following day a second rail for drying wet towels would have been appreciated we had to wait in the foyer for mins for breakfast on the sunday with several other guests the breakfast room was virtually empty on monday breakfast offered a poor variety of choices if you didn t want a full english breakfast but the traditional was good for those who wanted one
