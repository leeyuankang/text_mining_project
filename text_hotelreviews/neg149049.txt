basically the design and layout of this hotel are not well done my room was on ground floor w a small window facing street and right by an emergency exit door directly to street i needed to go through multiple steps stairs to access the room from the reception area room decor was not really fresh and updated needs to be updated bathroom layout is not practical there was not much space to put your stuff it would have been nice if usb or power outlets are at bed sides
