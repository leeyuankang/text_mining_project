the deluxe room we booked was extremely small with no space to even keep our luggage around the bed we had not even booked the standard room but the next category deluxe at a higher price than the standard room we were told that the standard room deluxe room are of the same size so i wonder why they were priced differently however since we were not too pleased with the size of our room the staff upgraded us to the next category room which was much more spacious however the upgraded room did not have a window or balcony and was below ground level however the room had complimetary fresh fruits and complimentary water although this was provided on the first day only we did not get the complimentary water on the second day however since we were in a rush we did not bother asking for it
