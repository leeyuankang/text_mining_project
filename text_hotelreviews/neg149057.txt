a kensington hotel should be a place of serenity and relaxation at park grand london kensington guests can relax in the elegant and chic surroundings and feel at home while away from home the beautifully appointed guest rooms are designed with the utmost attention and embellished with plentiful amenities we were informed that we had been given free upgrade by the receptionist on arrival only to find that we had been put in rooms below ground level my room had a man hole cover in it and rather unpleasant odour there was no natural day light with no window and the booking did not included breakfast my colleague immediately asked for a new room with a window and was moved to a room in a far reaching part of the hotel with a window but not much of an improvement use again not likely unless i can be assured of a natural above ground accommodation our perception was that the receptionist knew the rooms were not very nice but tried to counter that by stating we had been given these free upgrades prior to seeing the rooms for a dingy dungeon not very happy
