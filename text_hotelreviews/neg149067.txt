well the main problem was noticed the next day on waking up it was strangely very dark i thought it must still be the middle of the night and tried to sleep longer and when i woke up again it was still dark something didn t feel right so i checked my phone and it was i arrived in the evening and didn t open the curtains and when i did there wasn t a window behind there so be warned that the basement level could all be like this it s not nice and very confusing to have a windowless room i m sure the higher rooms don t have this problem
