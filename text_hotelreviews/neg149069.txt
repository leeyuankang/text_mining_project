we were not notified of ongoing hotel maintenance and booking com never gave them my email address or any other contact info when we arrived we were told that there were no rooms available and we were transferred to a partner hotel approximately minutes from kensington the hotel did pay for the taxi to the other hotel at lancaster gate that hotel was very pleasant but the rooms were tiny it was acceptable for a single person but much too small and uncomfortable for a couple
