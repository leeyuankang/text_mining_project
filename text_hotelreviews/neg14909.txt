telephoned housekeeping and asked for ice as we had champagne i was asked if small or large bucket and was told it would be sent up to our room asap one hour later it hadn t arrived so i rang again and was told it would be sent up after possibly another hour or so and we rang again the lady we spoke to who said she was from housekeeping was extremely rude denied the request had been made and that was that we never got the ice nor any other contact from housekeeping not the treatment you would expect from this standard and priced hotel shame that this let them down
