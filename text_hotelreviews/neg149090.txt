i paid per night for a nominally superior double room it was so small that it was barely possible to walk round both sides of what was no bigger than a double bed the layout was appalling inadequate space to hang even one person s clothes virtually no drawers whatsoever the bathroom did not have a single shelf on which to place toiletries nowhere was there even one glass for water i have never ever been so ripped off my inquiry whether this really was a superior double was to be referred to the manager no one ever got back to me by all means pass this on to the hotel management i am and have never anywhere in a lifetime of travelling encountered such a ripoff who on earth gave this place stars
