there are certain things i would expect from a star hotel for example i did not find in the room a hair dryer and neither a toilet brush probably i could have asked for them but i expected them to be already available in the room the distance between the sink faucet and the bottom of the sink was also really small and the tea and coffee facilities could be better for example i only had decaf coffee in the room and no afternoon tea again i am sure i could have asked for them and i would have received them but this is something i expect to be available without asking in a star hotel however i was really pleased by the kettle and by the brand of tea s as well as by the coffee making facility
