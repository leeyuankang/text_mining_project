the hotel and room was extremely small as compared to pictures and the price i paid the lift could only fit people at once and there s only one lift so if you have a lot of luggage or if the hotel is busy you might be waiting a long time the room was also small since we booked the room for and the extra bed was not really a bed and no blanket we had to ask for it the bathroom had very little amenities the hotel front didn t have a ramp or anything so those with babies or those with wheelchair might have a hard time since we had to carry the stroller up and down the stairs everytime we entered and exit the hotel although the staff was always kind enough to help us
