if what was booked as described as a superior double was actually this room i fear for those that might occupy the standard room this was a fairly sub standard room by any objective measure quite small on two levels generally standard premier inn travelodge decor equipment etc but in the basement so generally noisy and quite airless foyer area is very cramped particularly when coach parties arrive as seems to be the norm for this hotel restaurant dining room also very cramped not a place to linger unless you are of course waiting to see reception when the coachees arrive
