hours before the opening of the check in time the hotel declined my cards whitout any reason it was the first time i had to face that kind of problem despite i ve always joined hotels with booking com for long time after checking with my bank i could verify there was nothing wrong with my cards and bank accounts so i had to call custumer service of booking com in order to be reassured on my booking in such a situation i learned the hotel must let the booked room available if you check in by pm once arrived at the hotel i had to wait minutes to have the room it was a bunker room without any window room so i asked to have a different room room that was near the hotel s kitchen with an old window overlooking on stairs leading down to some tin bins the room was nothing special and quite small i joined better rooms in different stars hotels in the u k considering the high volume of stars hotels available in lodnon my advice is that there are better hotels definitely
