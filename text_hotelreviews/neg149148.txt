carpet a little worn out but to be expected in a busy london hotel sound insulation is definitely inferior compared to likes of premier inn you can hear your neighbours and vice versa the room was in the basement or lower ground floor with blackout curtains and some sort of window shade so you could not see outside the lack of natural light meant that if you haven t set your alarm you might wake up as i did at thinking it is still only if you are expected to check out by a certain time this may be problematic also in the morning without the option of having a window to open you feel as though can hardly breathe and need to escape well before your check out is due we did not pay for the breakfast as for a head this did not represent good value for money in line with the room rate and there were better alternatives elsewhere
