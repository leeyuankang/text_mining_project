check in wasn t a good experience as we were told there was a problem with our room and asked if we would be prepared to go to a sister hotel in paddington it transpired that a few rooms were out of service and they were asking all the guests the same the room was very small considering we had booked a superior i did query this with reception who were going to call me back we waited for half an hour with no phone call so decided just to make do with the allocated room and not waste any more time
