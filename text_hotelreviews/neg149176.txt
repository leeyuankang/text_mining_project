the room was very cold whatever you do please stay away from room it stunks in this room and the heater does not work properly after several hours of no heating the bathroom floor started getting warm the staffs did not come up to check the faulty heater and it seems that they were trying to fix it from the reception it appeared that they knew about this problem they said that they were fully booked and no other rooms were available but i belived it was a lie as it stated that more rooms were available for booking online
