waiting for half an hour at pm in the reception on the night to check in as the reception did not know if the room was ready but the booking says check in from the young girl on the counter was only a trainee and no senior management to assist the room we booked was a twin and they gave me a double room we have stayed before but the service we got was very poor and will not be rushing to go back disappointing stay
