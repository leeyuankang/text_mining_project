i didn t feel that i m welcomed i came which was hours before the check in time and they didn t offer early check in however i had to respect that in case there weren t rooms left but when i came they kept me waiting for my luggage with no reason also they gave me a room on the first floor just infront of they street and you could imagine that how difficult to get sleep even i asked for a room on the upper floor i felt that i ve been treated like that because i m looking arab it is really kind of racism and inconvenience
