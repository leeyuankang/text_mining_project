if i had to complain about anything it was that there was not enough tea bags milk or bottled water although i had a room on my own my daughter s were sharing but there was only still fizzy bottle i think for the price i paid there should have been a bottle each i did mention about the tea bags milk when i was checking out but forgot to say about the water we were also charged for water at the table when we had dinner something else i forgot to mention but we didn t know that we had been charged until i got the bill
