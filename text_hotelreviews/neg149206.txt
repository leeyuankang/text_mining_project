the only negative point is due to the behaviour of one single staff member at the reception he gave us an adequate room and when we asked to change it he told us we should have wait the day after in the morning we asked and there wasnt any problem unfortunately in the afternoon we asked the same guy a pair of slippers and a bathrobe he said they had none we asked later on to another person and in minutes everything was brought to our room the rest of the staff was very nice and really helpful
