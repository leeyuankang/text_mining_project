unfortunately in our room we were subjected to a continuous noise coming from what sounded like an extractor fan in another room which was on the whole night and was very loud fortunately we had a few drinks before returning to our room for the night so managed to get off to sleep without the noice being too much of an issue but once waking up early the next morning the noise was a constant irritant i would not pay and stay here again if i knew i would have to tolerate that noise
