the full charge for the room was taken from my account twice one payment upon arrival as expected and another hours prior to my arrval which was not expected this i was informed was becuse an extra holding payment for the full room rate is taken and put into a holding account for working days before before being returned to my bank account subject to there being no damage to the room made by myself despite my efforts to speed up the return of my money by making many calls to both my bank and speaking to various managers and staff at the hotel to no avail it was the hotels responsibility to release the funds back to me following natwest offering authorisation codes to speed the hotel up i still ended up waiting until a week after my stay for the money to be returned to me in the meantime i had to borrow money from my family in order to pay for my food shop that week a fact that the hotel had no empathy for stating that this was policy even though i had stayed in other hotels this year and have never come across this so called policy though policy or not this is totally unacceptable one wouldnt accept paying twice for any service before essentially awaitng up to weeks for one of those payments to be returned how is this legal i will be informing bbc watchdog too i cant imagine the amount of money these chain hotels must be making in interest when selling hundreds of rooms every single say too its criminal no empathy or even understanding was expressed about my financial concerns or the predicament i had been placed in my concerns were diamissed by the hotel staff by words such as policy and i was told not to be so worrisome would they not be concerned themselves should their purchases be debited twice from their bank accounts
