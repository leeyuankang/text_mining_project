i lost my priority card my priority airport lounge card it was inside the card insert so the air conditioning worked in the room while i was away i informed reception but nothing was really done about it they didn t seem interested in looking for it as i was checking out i was initially given a basement room which was not acceptable so i complained they must have a lot of complains when they allocate this room there was another person checking in at the same time who also refused the room they tried to convince me that it is a bigger room but the pipes were exposed and very claustrophobic these rooms are not acceptable
