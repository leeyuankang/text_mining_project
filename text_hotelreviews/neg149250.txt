i have been double charged and am waiting for a refund full payment had already been deducted from my card the day before i arrived which i did not realise until getting back home and checking my account statement and was made to pay on arrival despite the hotel having already charged the card that was used for booking a day before arrival anyone thinking about staying at this hotel should be aware of this as i have travelled all over the world and have never come across this before hotel agent told me this was normal this is total rubbish very strange system therefore i will not stay at this hotel again have been told that i will be given a refund in a few days
