our room was on the floor number it must have been near the extractor outlet as it was noisy during the kitchen operating hours i was awoken on saturday mor ing by the fumes from breakfast service the smell was terrible the back ground noise from the extractor boiler passing through the room was annoying the cleanliness was good but i think the hotel and rooms need a deep clean the view was not good either we checked in early the check in process seemed rather chaotic when it was busy
