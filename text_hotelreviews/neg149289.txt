all staff apart from a concierge called cornelius cornelli where unpleasant this member of the concierge helped on a few occasions with a smile and great attitude everyone else on the other hand was rude no drinks at the bar as it was extremely rude waitress it was our first time to the bar and it was while they fixed the lock on the room door therefore my partner drank a beer from the minibar reception staff in particular on the evening were not approachable i ve never ever experienced this service from any hotel i ve been to weather it be or other than that the room was a strange basement room although after the service we recieved we literally nipped in to sleep and out again stay elsewhere if you want a more personable service if you get a bargain and use it for the bed then it will be fine
