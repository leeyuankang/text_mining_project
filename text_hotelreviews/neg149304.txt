they had a poster in the elevator advertising theater tickets that said ask for discounts we booked tickets through them for book of mormon unfortunately we discovered that we had paid each ticket over the price including the agency fee i would not recommend using their booking service since you will feel ripped off i would also not recommend book of mormon at any price much less the price that we paid
