we chose our room by the picture we saw on booking com which was a lovely big specious deluxe riverside room when we arrived for the check in expecting that room we thought we paid for they said because we booked through booking com they can t guarantee the same room which was a shame because when we did walk in the room they did gave us it was small comparing to the one they advertised
