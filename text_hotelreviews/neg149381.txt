everything was a little bit awkward we arrived early and the room wasn t ready for the next hours we were promised to be called when ready and it didn t happen we ve come back after hours the room was ready and no one ever called us the way to the room was like a labyrinth many different corridors and not a great signage we ve struggled to find it and when we asked for directions we were simply told at reception it s downstairs we ve only been given one key card not very convenient there were landline phones in the room none of them worked also the gym equipment was very dirty when i went to use the treadmill it was covered in sweat stains no sanitizer available in the gym it s a given in every hotel workout room not inviting overall nice hotel but everything was just a tiny bit awkward and the reception staff could be nicer we travel a lot and we do believe the reception really is the face of every hotel and is responsible for the first impression wasn t great for us i m afraid
