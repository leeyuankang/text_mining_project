our basement dungeon room was apparently an upgrade so i shudder to think where we might have been without it the sewer we found it very claustrophobic and there was an odd smell from the lack of clean air staff very insistent on paying upfront to the point that they visited my room at to rectify an error they made in billing me after we arrived at although i suggested it wait until morning as i was really tired lastly the shower door came off thankfully it didn t fall on my boyfriend who was using it but obviously very dangerous i called reception and they were ready to send someone to repair it which was great but i got the impression that wasn t the first time it happened
