poor service at the front desk we were put in the basement with no window on our arrival for a night stay asked to change rooms the next day however there was a big mix up and some disorganization at the front desk and they couldn t actually determine what room they moved us to all was sorted out in the end my question is there seems to be a problem with room selection by the front desk when booking with a party i e they give you the worst room
