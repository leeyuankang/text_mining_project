the breakfast was definitely not standard most of the staff were very helpful at breakfast but one man who greeted us on entry was not welcoming the other on the second day was great we tried to contact the hotel on two different email addresses prior to our visit to link our two bookings made on different occasions together we had no reply but managed to sort it out on arrival we kept the same room on both nights a deluxe double but had paid for a superior double on the second night the room was fine but it would have been nice to have been offered a discount or free breakfast for the second night
