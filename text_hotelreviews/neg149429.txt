the room was way too small located in the basement so you are basically trapped in a box without a window probably below the kitchen since my room was not at all soundproof every day i woke up around am with people kitchen workers staff slamming the anti fire doors every seconds and dragging some tables desks chairs upstairs every single day i didn t sleep well in any of my nights there when they finally would go a bit more quiet than i could listen to guests coming and going also the double bed barely fit me and my wife
