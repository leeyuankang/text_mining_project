i had sent a message asking for an early check in shortly after i made the booking i didn t hear from the hotel but assumed that it would be ok when it came to it i wasn t able to check in early which was a bit annoying as we would have liked to freshen up before a long afternoon and evening at a hyde park concert next time i would contact the hotel directly with any requests although our room was very nice and well designed it was in the basement with a view of a brick wall
