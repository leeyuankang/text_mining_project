we were allocated rooms in the basement without windows i am surprised that this kind of rooms even exist after discussing the unstuitability of this with the very rude receptionist they gave us rooms one floor higher but in the very end of the corridor claimimg it was an upgrade this was after we explained that my husband has a heart condition so he can not stay in a room without windows rooms are tiny and of very poor standard
