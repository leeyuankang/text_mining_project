the refrigerator was not checked before our occupancy as reception was told it did not work and returning back in the evening was still not working also there was no directory on the phone telling you what no you should press for reception also there was no price list of the food and beverages in the room or in the fridge so didn t know how much it cost to use also the small plastic bottles of water provided outside of the fridge as a courtesy was only provided for the first night any more you had to pay for now staying there for nights at could you not provide a little more a little thing like that goes a long way as it only costs down the road
