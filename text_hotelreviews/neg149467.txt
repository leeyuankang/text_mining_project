at sign in they said they were going to relocate me to anther hotel in paddington due to some maintenance issues i refused to go to paddington and wondered why they hadn t said earlier then they refused to refund first night charges so i was trapped then they gave me a room in the bowels of the hotel and requiring me to go upstairs walk across the width of the hotel and back downstairs hard to find no good signs i will never stay at this or any other park grand again and i ve passed that opinion to others since i am a very frequent traveler
