i booked a plan that included breakfast when arrived the lady who checked me and my mother in insisted under the supervision and instructions of another member of staff that we booked a plan without meals included even after showing the email from booking com stating that breakfast was included to avoid any hassles i decided to pay for the additional breakfast cost at that point with the original price i expected to pay when i made the booking in the currency of my credit card not in gbp when i checked out the lady who supervised the junior staff when i checked in told me that they made the mistake of charging me extra for the breakfast and would refund the extra cost she processed the refund in gbp without asking which currency i would like to receive a refund because of their mistake the worst thing was that the supervisor that made the mistake when i checked in and the same person who was responsible for checking me out did not explain the situation nor offered any apologies i was only given an explanation after i sternly asked for one when she asked for my credit card to process the refund i could accept the almost misleadingly spacious image of the room when i made the booking considering the part of country i was visiting i could not accept the irresponsible and unprofessional handling of their mistakes i might not have shown my disagreement at the spot because i had my mother to take care of i would definitely advise against any one staying at such an establishment i would rather book a much cheaper accommodation and willingly accept such unprofessional service
