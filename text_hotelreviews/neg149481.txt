we were changed to another less nice hotel the first night for maintenance problems but i think they over booked other hotel was much poorer quality and tiny room with out a proper separate shower a curtain between the toilet and the shower area they would have left me there if i hadn t insisted on going back to my original booking plus i paid the same rate for the other hotel not happy about that they did pay for a limo to transport us which was appreciated
