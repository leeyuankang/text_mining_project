didn t stay in this particular hotel as initially planned due to a breakdown of hot water supply do your maintenance on a regular basis then this would be less likely to happen were transferred to their sister hotel in paddington where they first wanted to put into a basement room next to the breakfast hall not that there was almost no light it was loud and smelled like old chip fat after complaining we were relocated to the top floor into the tiniest room on the floor as could be seen on the fire emergency map it is to be mentioned that we have booked a deluxe double bed room which we obviously did not get on top of that the air conditioner was broken twice during our stay again you should do your maintenance on a regular basis apart from the page the staff was quite unfriendly inexperienced and not of particular use train your personnel properly seriously all in all quite a big disappointment does not really fulfill the image that is created online our last stay there
