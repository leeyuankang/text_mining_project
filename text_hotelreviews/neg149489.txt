arrived minutes before check in and had to wait for the minutes before being allowed the key got room to discover the net curtain pole wedged in the window promptly fell down the bathroom was dirty the toilet didn t flush properly and despite booking a room with internet the neolithic age scam is that the internet only works in the lobby if as a guest you are so unreasonable to want internet for the room then that is a scamming per day and even then it s slow staff were about as user friendly as a brick to a drowning man on the third day taking the lift down it stopped on floor two for a cleaner who happily threw perhaps a dozen bin bags into the lift around me jumped in pushed the floor for the basement and grumbled at me who had merely said hello and smiled for stopping at the ground floor to get out this is a hotel catering for one off rather than repeat business if you want somewhere purely as a base to explore then ignore the useless staff and enjoy the central location if you are on business for or days then forget it you will be grumpy stressed and no doubt here writing a neg review too
