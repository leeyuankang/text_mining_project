i booked this for my wife who was traveling on her own first time in london i went for a better quality hotel thinking that the service and hotel would be very accommodating ohh i was so wrong i set the booking as a late check in and as my wife got there at due to traveling long distance when my wife at the hotel very tired and wanting to sleep and rest the hotel reception would not allow her to check in as she did not have my credit card when i booked through booking com i said that i would not be traveling and i was booking it on her behalf i asked to speak with the reception team as my wife is a foreign to try to explain the situation reception declined and was trying to chuck my wife out of the hotel and treat her like a tramp of the street i rang the booking desk and a man said there was noting i could do unless i paid again so with my wife now crying i had to transfer money to her account so she could get a room so now i have paid twice something i was not happy about reception said to my wife i could call the manager tomorrow that s very helpful after minutes of waiting on hold to speak to booking com apparently the only person who could sort this mess was them i spoke to a nice man that rang the hotel and then they said the had refunded me and could take hrs still no money and they had upgraded her if the room was a upgrade i would of loved to see the first room a ground basement floor room not only this but when i booked i asked that i did not want ground floor as i wanted upper floor for better safety for a single women on her own i have worked in hotels for over twenty years and single woman are always put on upper floors this is one of the worst experience i have ever had to deal with my wife some distance away and me at home looking after my young children worrying if my wife will be on the streets of london all night
