the door key would stop working if we had been outside of the hotel during the day which was frustrating being on the third floor and having to go back down to reception every time it wouldn t work also a handy tip make sure valuables are locked away as we had something go missing from one of our rooms luckily it was hotel property but it was something of value which would ve been costly at our expensive if we hadn t realised it had gone missing the safe is free so i would advise to use it with anything of value i even put expensive straighteners in there which i m hindsight i am thankful i did it might have been a one off but just a warning to future guests as it was very disappointing to have something taken from our room as the hotel was lovely apart from that and it affected our time staying at the hotel as we were worrying where the item had gone
