noisy room even though we requested a quiet one no good eateries around the area we booked at the park grand kensington as we had several events and chores to do around the area that could be done either by walking or a couple of tube stops max when we got there only they informed us they were doing some maintenance work and they will locate us to a sister hotel which was in paddington nightmare all our trips took at least extra and had to use lots of taxis which is enormously expensive we said we didn t want another area and all what they said was sorry we tried to inform our customers this is not true as i did the booking on march and i think they had enough time to inform us of this if they told us that before hand we could ve either cancelled as we had free cancellation until day prior to arrival or used the heathrow express to reach paddington rather than paying a ridiculously high taxi fare from the airport to kensington then jump on the free taxi they provided to the other hotel as a reward they also provided us with breakfast but it wasn t of any interest this was done extremely unprofessionally and i would advise you to confirm with the hotel before booking there
