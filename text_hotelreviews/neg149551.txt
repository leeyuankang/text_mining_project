the toilet in our room was so close to the sink we couldn t stand in front of it to wash the bathroom was badly designed as lots of wasted space because it was a wet room it seemed as if it was a disabled bathroom as it had rails by the toilet this was quite odd as we hadn t booked a disabled room there were no facilities such as a bar area to relax in there was a small area to sit in at the front of the hotel but was full up with very few people
