room had the old metal window frame with wired square glass to bottom half of window and louvre slats at the top half this made the room feel very cold a little balcony that would have been more pleasing to the eye had it been cleaned of all the cigarette ends all over and maybe a pot plant or two as the only outlook is a brick wall didn t have to look at this though as closed curtains to try and keep room warm turned on heating but didn t come on until i informed reception
