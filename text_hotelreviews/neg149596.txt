we notified the hotel in advance via booking com that this was a special anniversary weekend for ourselves and our son and his fianc e despite this the hotel allocated only one anniversary room and gave this to my son and his fianc e despite it being our anniversary when i went to speak politely to them about this the female night supervisor suggested we swap rooms she was rude and brusque and said she personally wouldn t complain if it was her the next day the manager apologised as we were checking out and said it was totally their fault and they had got it wrong he offered a discount but said the computers were down so he would forward this to us later in the day days later we still had not received any email or financial compensation and we phoned to ask about this the lady supervisor answered and was immediately rude i asked to speak to the manager who apologised again and he eventually forwarded our refund we wouldn t be quick to recommend this hotel or to stay there again due in particular to the lady supervisor whose name is ruxy the other staff were nice but sadly her attitude and lack of customer service has put us off
