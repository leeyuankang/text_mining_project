none of the restaurants were available for us on the day as there was a corporate event going on that took over the restaurants there was a bar serving snacks but we had planned a nice course meal we had looked at the menu for the restaurant online and decided to have a late lunch early dinner before the evening show we were advised that we could have room service but a nice three course meal is not so nice of your laps in the bedroom
