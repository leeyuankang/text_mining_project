when we arrived at the hotel we had no use of electric at all in our room this went on for about minutes when we finally got help they had unplugged the kettle and the safe so we had no use of either of these the pillow cases had stains all over them and there was rubbish all over the bedroom floor they claim to have upgraded us to one of their club rooms but i do not believe they did this
