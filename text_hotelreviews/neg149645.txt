window wouldn t shut properly told reception and they sent handyman who hardly spoke a word of english to have a look he slammed it shut as far as it would go which we had already done and told us to turn up the heating if we were cold but there was still a half inch gap which we ended up stuffing with tissues to keep out the draft and street noise there was also a ventilator on the window frame but the cover had obviously broken off it so again we had to stuff this with tissues to stop the draft bathroom was arranged for disabled access with rails and emergency cord etc not sure if this is standard to all rooms or we just happened to be in the disabled room but while it was very spacious with a large wetroom style shower area no bath though the toilet which had no lid and was rather high was right next to the small low sink so quite awkward for face washing etc generally very clean although we did notice a bottle top just under the edge of the bed on the floor comfortable bed but would have been nice to have feather or down pillows rather than synthetic filling noisy fridge in cupboard for overpriced minibar which actually wasn t even cool inside so we switched it off overnight as it made quite a loud humming noise
