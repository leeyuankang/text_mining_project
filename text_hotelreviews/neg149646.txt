the only thing was that our children had paid for us to stay as a birthday treat and reception wanted the card that had booked the room and because we didn t have it they had to refund the original card and then use one of our cards to pay for the room our children were not happy as we obviously then saw how much it was and now have to transfer that amount back to us however the staff were so lovely about it we ourselves could not be cross about it
