initially the hotel staff at the front desk seemed very professional and accommodating i went to london to see a friend of mine and she has an infant i had called the reception desk to book her a taxi to take her home and made sure to mention that she will need a standard cab because she needed to fit her baby carriage the staff called for the wrong type of cab and seemed agitated and annoyed that we needed another type of cab for my friend s baby my friend and i were taken aback and that reaction left a bad taste in our mouths
