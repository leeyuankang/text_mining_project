my room smelled horribly of cigarette smoke even though i specifed during my booking process that i wish to get no smoking room after my complain i was offered to change the room but since i was in business travel just for nights and i alreadyy unpacked i just did not want to bother i asked to ventilate the room but the terrible smell remained it s a shame cause everything else was really at the good level
