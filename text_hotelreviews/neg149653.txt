the room was very dingy for a star hotel in kensington i did expect more there was no natural light we were taken to a basement it was pitch black with no windows and smelt of damp it wasn t unbearable but some of the facilities were unsatisfactory as i was going on a night out with my boyfriend i wanted to do my makeup but as there was no natural light i had to find a suitable lamp to sit next to the lamp by the side of my bed kept flickering on and off my boyfriend didn t like the room service food the bed was quite small checkout was at and it was very embarrassing when a member of staff walked in on us at without any notice as we weren t dressed yet
