everything was great but the first bad experience we had while doing check in was trying to moove us to other hotel which was very poor far away from the center after refusing they switched us back to the original hotel which was excellent the relative low rank is due to this bad experience i must be honost they add breakfast on them with no extra charge i reccomend
