you check in at the hotel and then told there is a maintenance issue and you are relocated around the corner i checked with other guests and they checked in the same day so my feeling is as we had a cheap rate they put you elsewhere the hot water didn t work the whole stay even when we had maintenance come and try and resolve the issues and i was told other people where complaining so you really have a star hotel
