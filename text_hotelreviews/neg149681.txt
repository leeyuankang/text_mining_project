meant to stay at the kensington hotel supposed to have a microwave and a fridge to cut down on food costs got transferred from this hotel second time in two stays this has happened to a smaller sister property with neither of these in the room the staff were polite and helpful but due to the location and tube lines not working properly this created a lot of stress which could have been avoided had they moved us to a different room within the same hotel
