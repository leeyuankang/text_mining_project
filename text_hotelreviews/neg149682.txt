the room i was given is the corner room in lower ground floor it wasn t sound proof at all i could hear people e g cleaning staff etc talking outside and tapping their foot i called the reception to change my room but they assured me to ask people not to talk i front of room but you can t stop people walking the wifi was very very weak and also i couldn t use my phone due to lower ground floor i have e planned everything next morning up the manager but not a good outcome i will not recommend anyone to go there
