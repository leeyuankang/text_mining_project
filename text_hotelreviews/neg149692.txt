unfortunately when we arrived to check in we were told that we were being moved to a sister hotel the paddingtond grand on the far side of hyde park it was said that it was because of problems with plumbing in our original room this was well outside the kensington area where we needed to be contrary to what reception staff told us i have no evidence that any attempt was made to inform us beforehand there was no practical possibility of making alternative arrangements a taxi service was available but this inevitably took time we found this to be exceptionally poor service which distrupted our weekend it was clear that we could have been informed beforehand that the hotel was not available but were presented with a fait accompli which put our requirements far down the list of their priorities
