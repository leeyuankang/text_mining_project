on arrival we only had minutes to get ready we were told by reception that our room had been upgraded so we though great however when we entered the room we found a wet room which was meant for a disabled person the sink was tiny and right on top of the toilet which was very difficult to get around when i complained the next morning the young lady on reception just said oh and that was it the gentleman next to her asked what was the problem and when i explained to him also the fact we didn t complain the night before because we didn t have time it was just left i know you have no control over your guests also but the room next to us had their tv on quite loud until the early hours which didn t help matters so all in all what was supposed to be a nice relaxing time turned out to be a very disappointing experience and i certainly will not be recommending your hotel or returning back any time soon
