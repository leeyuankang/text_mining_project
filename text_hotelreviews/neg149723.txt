we were given a room with a disabled access bathroom which was very badly designed despite being a good size there was no room between the basin and the toilet the basin was tiny and very low and if you stepped back you could easily fall over the toilet as we had paid for a superior room this was disappointing as it felt we were staying in a hospital
