i initially booked at earl s court and finally sent us to their paddington hotel because they have maintenance in some rooms no warning calls or email they pretend they could not reach me neither my colleague surprisingly they were nice enough to pay for the taxi to drive us to paddington but it seems to be usual practice to overbooke one hotel in order to fill in the other last but not least in paddington you have to cross the road to go to the breakfast room and it s noisy renovation works all night nearby
