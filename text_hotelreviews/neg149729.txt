room was small i booked a superior double room on booking com when we got to hotel the guy on reception said he had upgraded us to a different room but it was small so i thought well if this is small good help the one that i had originally booked a one of the staff were annoying one member had a key and let himself in our room when we were there he didant even knock the door he had a lady with him so she must have complained about her room and he moved her he must have just assumed no one was in our room but still shouldn t have done that overall a good hotel
