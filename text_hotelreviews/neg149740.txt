the room size could have been somewhat larger given the price i was however quite disappointed in terms of cleanness especially in the bathroom where dust could not be missed on the black table surrounding the sink furthermore the shower door mounted on rails was really a challenge for us as the door was broken off the rails finally part of the bathroom floor was also damaged
