breakfast queuein the morning was incredible we had to go back to our room and wait to get called the choice for brekkie was poor by the time you got down there as it had been hovered up by the other guests it could have been managed much better by giving us notice of busy times if you have special dietary requirements then give them notice as they ran out of gluten free bread
