a letter was placed under our door while we were out warning us that there were strange smells in the vicinity of our room and if we were caught disobeying the no smoking policy we would be fined we found new chocolates on our pillows so someone had been in the room while we were away and they should have been able to know that it was not us causing the issue i was offended and annoyed by the incident although i guess it is challenging for the hotel to handle such cases without offending someone
