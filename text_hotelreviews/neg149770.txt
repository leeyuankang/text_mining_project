i asked for a room with a view i should have never done so the hotel has some rooms in two basements apart from maybe windowed upstairs room mine in the second basement had no window or ventilation at all when i complained the girl at the reception told me that i was lucky because the room was larger than the one booked maybe she was right it is true that i could stand up and walk around the bed if i did not need to cross another person
