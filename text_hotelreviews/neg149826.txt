the hotel was unable to take us due to a boiler breakdown but arranged a replacement hotel in marble arch a courtesy minicab was provided for the transfer but the driver stood outside the car playing with his phone for minutes we complained and he was made to take us although he had sat nav he got lost as he had ear phones on and was playing with his phone as he drove and i had to direct him back to the route he then went the wrong way down a one way street and met a car coming the other way did a three point turn in a parking bay and then took us down a dead end so i had to ring the hotel to find out where we were meant to be as he didn t have a clue then direct him to our final destination the staff at the new hotel were very sympathetic about it but i never received any feedback from a manager on my complaint about the experience would i use that hotel group again no
