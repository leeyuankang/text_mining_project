our check in was a little late and although sorted promptly when we went to check in at after arriving at and having a drink at the bar we were told our room was not yet ready once we spoke up about needing our room as we had plans to get out promptly we were then given rooms it would have just been more pleasant and efficient to sort that out before telling us that our rooms were not ready especially as they were aware we had arrived in good time and had been in the bar for an hour
