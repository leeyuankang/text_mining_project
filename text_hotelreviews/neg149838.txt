my flight was cxl due to fog and called the hotel that i was rebooked for the next day flight asked their consideration to waive the first night no show because there was no way that i could come on sunday as all flights to lhr were cxl and i tried to fly the next day so all stay are not all cxl actually only first night talked to manager and no compassions shown just said sorry we could not reimburse the first night maybe it is london where they do not need loyal customer but i have lost faith and vowed to never return to this hotel compare to hotels in asia where they show more emphatic to any force majeure and flexibility this hotel just don t care
