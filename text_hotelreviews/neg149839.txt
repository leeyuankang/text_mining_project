i stay in a lot of london hotels and have done for a few years using the booking sites to find good value however as soon as i walked in to reception i realised i had stayed at this one before because of the damp musty smell when i checked in i said please tell me i m not in a downstairs room but i was and they said they didn t have anything else this means you get more of the damp musty smell and no windows the concierge kindly escorted me to the room and switched the air conditioning fan on to full
