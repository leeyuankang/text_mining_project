first of all i searched alot of hotels through booking and i chose this hotel based on customer reviews from the first moment i arrived to this hotel i could tell this is not a stars hotel by any mean and i could not understand why people rated it for bad attitude from staff in check in and room cleaning is horrible first night when i came back to my room late at night there was a big dirt stain on my bed cover and guess what they only flipped the bedcover to the other side this is not only bad service but also cheating customers after complain so many times they start to do it better but not good enough to star hotel standard the towels in the bathroom totally overused and i had skin allergy i had the worse vacation in my life in this place they ruine my anniversary and birthday celebration mood and most importantly if you want to leave the hotel they wont refund you money because its non refundable booking so where is your rights is customer if you dont like the place there is non you are just stuck with it if you are looking for nice hotel dont ever think of this hotel
