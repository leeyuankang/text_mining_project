this is a bait and switch and a totally dishonest behavior booking should stop working with these two hotels i booked a superior double room when i arrived late at night after quite a wait the receptionist tells there is an electric problem with my room i believe this to be a lie despite having my email and mobile number no communication was made to me to inform me they did not even have an alternative to provide and so i had to wait for quite a while until they could find a room at another hotel of the same owner group i would guess by the time i finally get to the other hotel the shaftesbury premier london paddington hotel i get a tiny room in a pretty bad shape although the bathroom was recently renovated this room gives on the reception and on a window on the parking street so rather noisy and this room at the same price as the first one originally booked
