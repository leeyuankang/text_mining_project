breackfasts were disastrous on saturday morning we had to wait over minutes to get to breakfast room and still we couldn t get one table for me and my daughters all the food that was meant to be warm was already cold and there was hardly anything left getting coffee and tea took ages and whole hall was pretty messy and we weren t there even late about next day we went earlier because of our flight but when we came back out there were a lot more people waiting to get in to breakfast
