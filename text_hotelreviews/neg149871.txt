i was asked for photo identity at check in nothing in the booking details suggested this was needed when i said i had none i was told that it was the law but it would be okay this time i pointed out that this is nonsense and eventually the receptionist said it was just the hotels policy this is not acceptable and a poor start to the stay to be fair everything was fine after that
