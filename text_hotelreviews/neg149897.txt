i have booked a deluxe double room at this hotel and what i got was a dark room in the basement with virtually no window see pictures for prove i never been to a hotel with no window in the bedroom before i asked at the reception for a different room but they refused to give me one for a star hotel this is an absolute impudence so if you still plan to stay at this hotel make sure in advance that you are getting a room floor or above and not in the basement
