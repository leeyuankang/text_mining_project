no fault of the hotel but we had a room next to a family who also had relatives in another room every day and night there was knocking banging on walls slamming doors yelling kids up til as late as when we complained the manager said they wont stop so it is easier to move you they did move us but i feel they could have done more to stop those who were causing it
