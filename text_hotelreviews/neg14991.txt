when we went for breakfast which was not cheap all the cooked food was cold so we could not eat it we were told by waiter to get some more but it also was cold we spoke to the restaurant manager and he just said you should have just got some but it was cold the point being that it should not have been cold in the first place and freshly cooked its a star hotel and we expected better it ended our experience with you on a low we spoke to the customer liaison staff and they said they would look into it and get back to me but no reply from them on saying that the overall experience was amazing thank you
