as returning guests we found that front desk staff need to be a little more responsive i went down to revalidate key card which failed to work the fellow concluded the checking in of a new guest which took like forever as the new guest had issues with payment etc revalidating the key could have taken a few seconds whilst still attending to the fresh guest housekeeping staff very obtrusive and impatient as they kept opening the room intermittently ignoring the fact you were indoors and your state of undress they practically forced you out when they wanted to clean aside from these issues all was well
