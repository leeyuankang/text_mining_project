the sat nav in my new car qashqui would not accept the postcode off the web site there is a lack of signage to the hotel on the roundabout as you approach millennium way the cooked breakfast although there was a good selection of stuff was luke warm the room although equipped with a coffee maker only had two teabags and a couple of sachets of sugar about half teaspoon of white and brown we went up to the bar on the floor and had one drink each because the drinks were sooooo sooooo very very expensive the music in the bar was awful very repetitive boom boom trance music not at all relaxing or pleasant
