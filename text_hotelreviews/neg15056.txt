i booked this hotel for the location of it as i was going to a concert in arena getting to the was a breeze from hotel perfect in fact but coming back the same way was a totally different story was told the fate would be open for return to hotel until but as we rerurned from the concert at it was locked so had to find another route to hotel so being young ladies we asked the security well security guards later and mins walking back and forward we managed to get to hotel but with very sore feet and a dampener on a great evening and great hotel stay
