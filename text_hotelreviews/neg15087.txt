on event nights the bar on top floor gets so full you can t get in it was a shame as we had tried to go there before the event in the afternoon but it didn t open until we were only staying one night and it was first visit to this hotel so would have loved to experience the views from the bar at night the other bar was open so we went there but still had to queue for minutes for drinks at the servers did not serve people in order of arrival which was a little frustrating i was queing alone next to another woman and the big groups of guests or couples were served first despite me pointing out that i had been there before them to the bar staff this put me off and was a shame as we probably were paying the same price to stay there and everyone should expect the same service whether a returning guest or a business guest or simple a guest staying for leisure purposes if you like firm pillows ask at reception as the pillows in room are like marshmallows
