when we first checked in they gave us a tiny twin room which is not what we had asked for once we came back down and asked to be switched rooms we got a far nicer room probably twice the size with a kingsize bed so not sure why we weren t given to us straight away as we are clearly a couple also for the price it would have been nice to have been provided with breakfast or at least some toiletries other than soap we had forgotten our toothpaste
