the staff at breakfast were not as helpful as they could be we came down to breakfast at it finished at and everything was on on offer but as it got busy food ran out and you had to ask for food to be restocked replenished bacon croissants orange juice pancakes etc which was done eventually but only what you asked for which meant lots of empty plates therefore less choice for later guests
