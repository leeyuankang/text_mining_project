very good overall just one feedback when we called and reported that housekeeping forgot to give us coffee we were given the following day with more packs but just left it scattered all over our table oir complimentary shampoo bottles and tissue box were also left scattered and was not arranged as usual not sure if it was connected to our complaining that cleaning lady forgot to supply us coffee
