when i was looking at hotels in paris i knew my husband and i would be getting in at after flying from the u s so we would be jet lagged but it was our anniversary so i wanted to make it special i paid extra at least to have a room with a view and a tub arriving to the hotel i thought we must be in the wrong place because this hotel couldn t possibly have a view they later said a few rooms did but i don t see how they did upgrade us by giving us a huge room with an awkwardly attached living room and second bath that didn t flush space we absolutely didn t need when i asked why we didn t get a room with a view the desk manager seemed confused why i would care but the entire reason we booked this hotel was to enjoy champaign in the comfort of our room while enjoying the view the worst part of it all was they offered free breakfast the next morning we didn t make it to breakfast but at checkout they tried to charge me from my research you can get a much nicer hotel with better amentities for much cheaper don t splurge on the view as i did you will be disappointed
