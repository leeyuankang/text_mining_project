first room that we had we found bed bugs and the sheets appeared not to be washed properly unclean room we asked to be moved but they hotel could only fit us into a much much much smaller room it was tiny for people with luggage for the amount of money paid we were expecting a lot more staff were efficient and did their job yet did not go out of their way to help not provided with a tourist map no friendly chat just gave us our room key and sent us on our way overall seemed like a dated hotel that was a bit tired
