wifi the worst wifi we ever had on our european tour they want to charge you n for high speed internet not disclosing it on time of booking is very deceiving otherwise you have zero internet at all one more thing that really surprises me the hotel doesn t have a cart to carry your luggage to your room if you have a lot of luggage you need to keep going up and down quite a few times the room is not really cleaned especially the toilet bowl i end up cleaning it by myself which is actually disgusting thank goodness i brought my own lysol
