we visited here with another couple and although we both booked a classic double room which in the booking description detailed in below picture had a bath we were placed in a room with a tiny shower and no bath the shower was so small that you bashed your elbow on the tap and brushed the shower door as you turned we complained to the reception who told us that there was two types of double rooms and the ones with the bath were all booked we could only get a bath if we paid for an upgrade we found the receptionist very rude and unhelpful i find this really outrageous as they advertise the room as with a bath in our opinion a double bed was shoved in a single box room and attempted to be passed as a double the whole room was tiny our mini bar only had one soft drink when we arrived and they tried to charge us for the listed contents of the fridge when we checked out good location but disappointing room for the expensive price you pay for a supposed star hotel we traveled many countries in europe and this hotel was the worst
