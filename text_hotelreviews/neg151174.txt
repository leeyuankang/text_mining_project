i was supposed to have a am phone call to wake me it never came i asked the night before for a regular paris taxi to take me to the airport when i came down the driver was already there but he spent minutes trying to figure out where the airport was when i got into the taxi the meter was already set on euros it was am and there was no traffic i was told the taxi to orlay airport was euro it was and the driver locked the doors until i paid no taxi ever did that in the many times i traveled to paris i will never forget that i do not trust the staff who calls a private driver and the driver doesn t know where a major airport is located shame on him and shame on your staff i will not stay there again
