i guess what felt like a bait and switch the executive rooms offered on this website are not all the same be aware if you book an executive room with a view of the arc de triomphe confirm with the hotel that you will actually get that room not room on the first floor i did not get the room as advertised on this website or confirmed by booking com and no other executive rooms with a view of the arc were available at the time to the hotel s credit i was offered an executive room on the third floor but only for the second night it was paris in the summertime after all i get it the staff was helpful in addressing the situation but unfortunately this still would not have had a view as advertised and it would have been inconvenient to change rooms mid stay my intention here is not to complain like a child or bash the hotel as i think it is in fact a nice hotel i just would prefer that they be a little more clear on what you are actually buying when you book through booking com on a side note just be aware in general what you are buying from booking com i think it s a good service but when you don t get what you paid for you ll get a response saying the hotel is responsible for their page and there is nothing we can do and the problem is that since you have already prepaid for the rooms there really is nothing that you can do either
