we arrived in paris on october in the late afternoon and checked into our hotel we asked where the hotel parking was situated and were told that there were only a few parking spots and they were only for small cars and therefore were not able to park our suv we were totally misguided since the advertising showed that parking was included and size of vehicle was not specified the hotel clerk told us to park a few blocks from the hotel we proceeded to go to our room we found the carpet to be absolutely filthy we requested another room after showing us the third room it was even worse we were told that the carpet had faded also the walls had water damage best western should be informed of this situation since their reputation is at stake please refer to the pictures of the hotel room we obviously did not want to stay there however the clerk said that we were going to be charged for the four nights we immediately called bookings customer service they informed us that we would only be charged for one night because it was so late we didn t have time to look for another hotel so we stayed at the best western needless to say we had a sleepless night we checked out the next morning we were charged for that night bookings suggested a few other hotels and we chose pullman which was rated as a four star this is truly a four start hotel and we were very satisfied the best western was also rated as a four star the question is who is rating this hotel in our opinion it should have been a two star we were extremely disappointed with this best western especially since we had just come from a best western in amboise loire valley we were satisfied with it we are requesting a refund euros for the one night at best western allegro due to our dissatisfaction with the cleanliness and inconvenience we were so uncomfortable and did not sleep that night thank you for your consideration regards milos jojic
