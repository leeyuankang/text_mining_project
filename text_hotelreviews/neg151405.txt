i thought i booked a room for two at an agreed upon price when i arrived i was told i booked a single room and was charged pounds a day more for a room for two also there was no elevator direct to our third floor room we had to ride an elevator that accommodates only two people or one with luggage and exit on the fourth floor then we walked through two corridors and finally down a flight of stairs to the third floor the other option was climbing three flights of stairs i would not have booked the room st the price we were charged my friends booked a better accommodation in the same area that was less expensive had two beds while we had one and provided complementary breakfast which we didn t get their facilities had a much better layout
