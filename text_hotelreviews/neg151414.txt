my friend dropped some nail polish on their carpet they told us to get it professionally cleaned which we paid an outside firm pounds to come and do the stain faded to barely anything to match all the other stains from previous guests without my authorization or agreement they charged my card with pounds for what they call damages i was appalled and i am disputing this payment with my cc company the manager did not know nor share the terms and conditions and handled it rudely and without any customer handling competence stay here if you want to get ripped off never again
