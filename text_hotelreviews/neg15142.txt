there were two brown stains on the carpet in our room which was disappointing considering we paid for one night in a superior room the menu guide on the tv was faulty and when it did finally work it would not let us press select on the options spotify etc the speakers in the bathroom were also much quieter than when we stayed the first time to such an extent they were mostly pointless things i would not expect of such a luxurious hotel rather a long queue for breakfast
