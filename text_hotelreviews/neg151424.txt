i had no hot water to have my shower which was really inconvenient i needed to be at appointment for so could not wait any longer and i was very disappointed that this was not reflected in a reduction in my final bill as i feel this was a major facility that was lacking during my stay and it did inconvenience both myself and my daughter greatly not to be able to have a shower in the morning especially as she was going for wedding dress fitting i understand this was a one off fault with the water heating system and not the usual experience for guests however i do feel we should have received a reduced invoice to reflect the inconvenience
