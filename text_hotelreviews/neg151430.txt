very weak hair blower which shouldn t be the case when paying this amount for a small room no defined set up to blow dry hair i had to sit on the carpet open the cupboard for a mirror and plug the dryer in behind a sofa chair simple mirror on the wall near socket would suffice where i could turn the chair around a little thought is needed here not money well except i would say it s worth investing in decent blow dryers for the impression made considering the lovely quality and care in the rest of the furnishings however this would not stop me from staying agian
