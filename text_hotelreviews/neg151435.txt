in my room was very noisy woken a number of times during the early hours of the morning and very late at night from above i don t know what was above me but too consistent to be someone s room like a working area for staff hard to tell banging and walking all the time only down part of stay would just get a different room next time rooms vary so much it s a good idea to see exactly what you are getting saying that all rooms seem to be beautifully decorated
