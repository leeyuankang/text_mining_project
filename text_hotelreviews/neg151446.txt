i made a mistake booking in this hotel thinking that it was the beaufort apartments which came highly recommended to me in this facility i did not like the fact that the elevator only goes up to the fourth floor and you have to climb up to the fifth floor the elevator is very small and very slow beds were too soft and uncomfortable house keeping will not remove any left over food from the rooms i realised that the empty pizza box is not going to be taken out and on the second day i put it outside the room your can hear sounds from other rooms because the soundproofing is either not done or not good i would not recommend this hotel to any of my friends
