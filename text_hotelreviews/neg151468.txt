offering but not delivering not considering customers needs just plain strange i booked room only but was offered a complimentary cream tea then it never arrived despite calling to chase i didn t even want it but they insisted on check in so i waited around for it frustrating any kind of tea never arrived and none in room offered to have cream tea on my return from dinner at asked twice to have breakfast as a substitute when i accepted i was told there was a minute window on delivery who has that time in the morning when on business to wait around for breakfast also they do not notify when taxis turn up so you pay for the idling cost outside better to flag on the street
