the room was nice but personally i didn t think it was worth the money that it cost the handle in the shower fell off and the water was changing from hot to cold we paid for a river view but what we got was mostly car park it also wasn t explained to us very well we would be charged an extra on top of the room incase we used room service or mini bar the lady at reception explained this would be refunded however i am still awaiting this refund on the website it states for parking however we ended up paying
