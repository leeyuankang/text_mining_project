the subway you can not under any circumstances stay on the floor the noise is terrible even with earplugs its like the subway runs in the next room noicy beetween the rooms as well and the room was soo small from foot end bed to wall and the toilet door is not a door its just a sliding door in glass not very private and aslo very small i will not book this hotel again or recomend it to any one if you choose this hotel you must stay on top floor othervise choose another one
