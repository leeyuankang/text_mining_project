room is very small and bathroom is so small it really feels like an airplane bathroom also we asked the hotel to call a cab for us since we needed to get to the orly airport early friday morning it cost us and it was an uber not an official taxi and the real price is around this is taking advantage of tourists and not okay for a hotel to do that
