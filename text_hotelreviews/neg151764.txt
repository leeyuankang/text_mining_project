we paid extra for a eiffel tower view room but didn t have any view of it at all except for a tiny tip at the top over the back of some ugly buildings that are being renovated the room was very over priced it was small dark and very much in need of updating we have asked the manager to contact us about the fact that this is not what we had signed up for but haven t had any communication with him at all very disappointed indeed which cost us for nights for the room only for that price we would expect to have much better facilities and a far better room and at least what it says on the advert
