we asked for non feather duvets and pillows twice but they didn t change them and when questioned when we were going to bed said they didn t have any alternative to the duck down my wife is allergic to feathers so spent an uncomfortable night also when we returned after a meal out the bar was closed it was only abut and when we expressed our surprise the staff just shrugged it off didn t offer to get a drink and bring it up disappointing as one of the reasons we booked the hotel was for the quirky decor in the bar and public areas which were all closed by the time we got back not really good enough for a supposed star and not cheap hotel in central london
