the only bad thing i would have to mention is the fact that front desk staff told me that min was more than enough time to reach the train station by taxi when really at least half an hour was needed i believe this is due to the fact that few of them are native english speakers which made the conversation harder to lead i ended up missing my train but thankfully there was one only an hour later and it was sunday so no big deal there
