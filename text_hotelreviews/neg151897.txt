everything was full of dust during the whole stay the breakfast was the most absurd and pretentious of all tiny room compared to the price you pay to stay here there is no full length mirror and it is constantly dark in the room even if you turn up the lights to the max it is completely depressing and dark i don t get the hype about this place at all
