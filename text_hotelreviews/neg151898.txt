the hotel was under construction which it did not tell me on booking com when i checked in i had hours before a meeting and needed to sit on my computer the major renovation below shaking the room adn walls was a problem the staff moved me to a different part of the hotel with a upgrade but there was no desk in the room nor wine glasses nor bed side tables later in the evening there is no bar and the restaurant closes a bit early its a nice hotel just not contemporary i do not think it should be open during construction i sat in the lobby in the morning quickly on my mac which kept getting booted of the wifi and the construction started and there was bird poop all on the table where the canaries are really not appetizing i usally stay at phillip starcke hotels or ian schraeger places so its a bit more utilitarian this had the feeling more of where my auntie would dine with a cup of tea
