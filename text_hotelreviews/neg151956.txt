next door to chanel has its charm and it is dangerous hold on to your credit cards castille is a typical parisian hotel the rooms are small but cosy my room was on the six floor and the elevator did not work the first day great workout if you want to stay fit the room was quiet and the bed was comfortable the bathrooms look a bit run down and could need a touch up overall good experience for a business trip to fashion week it is the perfect fit
