the desk and tables in the room were dusty when we arrived and were never wiped down during our stay no pillow menu no tea and coffee facilities provided toilet wouldn t flush so we had to go downstairs to the lobby no shower gel provided so had to buy our own wood was chipped in places around the room bathroom consisted of a seperate toilet very old the shower was tiny and the paint was peeling inside there tiles were dirty and dated needs renovation badly in our room at least not a bad hotel at all but certainly not five star standard the male concierge was very nice and helpful however the female concierge who was working on monday february was incredible rude and unhelpful we asked about the advertised airport shuttle service additional fee and were told that it doesn t exist but they could call us a taxi when i asked the concierge why they advertise a shuttle service she blamed booking com and wouldn t take any responsibility on the hotels behalf and was very rude raised her voice to talk over me etc the reception staff were lovely though as was everyone else we encountered but our experience with the female concierge soured the whole stay and i wouldn t stay there again it s not worth the money
