sound insulation of the superior room was terrible that is not acceptable for such an hotel it is just similar to the average motel window insulation is ok but the wall were so thin that we could hear anything from the neighbors i will skip detail insulation with upstairs floor was ok but not great hope not all rooms are like that i was disappointed by staff reaction i was only offered a discount for a future stay
