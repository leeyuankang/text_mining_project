the only problems we noted were that the tea served to us at breakfast was cold and the food in the buffet was only warm they could have been a little hotter when we rang to confirm our booking the receptionist said that they were aware we were coming for my husband s birthday and said that they would make sure amenities would be available for us in the room though she couldn t say what i don t know what we expected to find but was ever so slightly disappointed that all there was waiting for us was little chocolates you would think for the price of the room and the amount you pay in the bar and for room service etc that the hotel could have pushed the boat out a little bit more
