had a bit of an issue trying to get a cab to the hotel at in the morning some thing to be aware of if you are on a tight schedule we were delayed getting away from the hotel to the airport by minutes waiting for a taxi other guests were delayed as well not sure if that is a geographical issue rush hour traffic issue or a lack of cabs just something to be aware of even though the staff was totally on top of getting the cab reservations made
