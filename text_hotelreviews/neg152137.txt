we had two issues one of which was slightly resolved there was a definite heating issue with our room our room deluxe would not heat above c it was a freezing week in paris and it was difficult to come back to a cold room the staff supplied a portable heater and each day they said they sent someone to repair the heating and that it was repaired it was not the space heater was sufficient but given the price of the room this should have been resolved in a different manner i suspect there were no other rooms available as this was over new year s our only other thought on how our stay could have been improved is if the hotel offered a petit dejeuner of just coffee juice and baguette or croissant we are not big eaters in the morning and did not want to pay euro per person for a buffet when we eat so little it was easy enough to walk to a different brasserie each morning but it would have been nice to have the option to stay in the hotel for breakfast
