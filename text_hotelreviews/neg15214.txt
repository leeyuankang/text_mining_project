we stayed here for ny all service was incredibly slow things like coffe machine and etc were missing in the room and we spent ages waiting for it during the breakfast the drinks are served very slow too plus the chemicals in the swimming pool especially hot tub is so strong that gave us both my partner and i an allergy and bloodshot eyes for days in addition minibar is with sensors so although we took things out to make our own water cooler and didn t use any of the goods and placed them back we got charged so it is always recommended to double check your bill in this hotel last but not least we paid extra for a river view room but got only a partial view i would not say it is worth the money in general i would not stay at this hotel again as from my experience when one is paying for a night a way better experience could be expected
