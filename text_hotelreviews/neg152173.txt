breakfast was not included in our booking and it was quite expensive it was euros for each person which seemed like a lot as a result we only had breakfast there once it s so easy to find a more reasonable breakfast in the neighborhood but it would have been nice to have a reasonable option in the hotel as well something quite strange happened while we were there which made us feel a little less happy with the stay but it s hard to say who exactly was to blame on the first night we went out to dinner and returned to the hotel where we sat in the bar for a little while when we left i brought my coat to my room from the bar the bartender said the next day he actually remembered i had it with me and the next morning it was gone i may have left it on a railing outside my room while i looked for our key card in my purse but we were in a part of the hotel that was shared with only one other guest room so unfortunately the only explanation could have been that a fellow guest or staff member took it it wasn t a very expensive coat but it meant i was walking around in the chilly weather without one for a day hoping someone would turn it in it never was turned in and unfortunately i had to buy another coat like i said it could have been another guest which is obviously not the hotel s fault but i just find it so strange that a coat would disappear in such a nice place
