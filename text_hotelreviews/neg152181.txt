we can be very critical when it comes to hotels we have no qualms with paying the price tag that comes with the luxury label provided we feel we ve been offered what we paid for and i can honestly say that our entire experience here was without flaw it s now our go to hotel in paris it feels five star and in fact trumps some of the ones we ve experienced in paris i would have enjoyed more room service options but this is merely a matter of personal preference
