very disappointed the difference between what was said by phone and the reality the staff is nice but not so helpful i had to bring my luggage alone to my room by stairs with no electricity to join my room which was a junior suite i have to go through a small court where all the bins are located odor and ugly to see beurk very rigid attitude for the breakfast service are we still in the s well the price vs quality are not at all justified there is a lot to do i wouldn t recommande so much this place after all disppatoined by the staff and the room
