jean could possibly do with some hospitality course he was cold and rude from the moment go and the hotel has absolutely no view well the toilets are small the sofa seats in the room are torn and the location isn t tempting the lift in the hotel is in a dire state and require a schindler or any standard lift to replace it if you would love to stay in a dungeon this is a perfect horror home the chain shouldn t be lending its name to such a hotel
