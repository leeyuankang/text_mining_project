couldn t believe that the only way to pay for breakfast was either cash or credit card what in this day and age is wrong with a debit card also breakfast ordered in our room was v expensive for what it was and cleaned us out of cash as we couldn t remember our credit card pin number and a bit disappointing strange quantities large amount of juice tiny amount of coffee large amount of croissants and toast just one tiny pat of butter between we asked for more coffee and butter but surely this is basic stuff
