the ac didn t work very well when i stayed in the quadruple room the cleaning staff were unfriendly and we re talking to me n a clearly irritated tone when i told them that i was not ready for my room to be cleaned yet they kept knocking on my room s for room service despite the very clear don t disturb sign now i am good at putting people right in their places which i did with the cleaning staff but no hotel customer should be treated that way by any staff the hotel management really needs to work on that
