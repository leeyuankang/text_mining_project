upsetting that some of your guests woke us at banging on our door others swearing shouting obscenities half dressed and when asked to be quiet by my wife was bombarded with abuse not directly the hotels fault but there is a duty of care for your guests and you did know you had a mass company xmas celebration and security should have been on some floors to counter this our room was changed immediately but still experienced guest disturbances
