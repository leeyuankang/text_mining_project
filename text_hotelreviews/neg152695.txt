unfortunately although the hotel offers a wide range of options for breakfast the hot options were not very good the coffee especially was terrible we d advise travellers to stick to the cereal and pastry options or alternatively go elsewhere for breakfast there is plenty to choose from in the area another couple of small disappointments were the quality of wifi in the hotel it was quite slow and choppy as well as the lack of parking for guests coming via car this was a bit of a hassle in terms of loading the luggage although there is some really well priced off road parking about minutes walk away via justpark still it would have been handier to simply park right next to the hotel
