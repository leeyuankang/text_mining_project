the price charged for the accommodation was over priced for what was actually offered the accommodation was times over the normal rate this was to cash in on ripping off concert goers the room was tiny air conditioning was poor and the temperature never dropped tiny window which looked out on the an eating area tiny bathroom with no room which was exceptionally hot breakfast was not included in the charge so thankfully we did not have to endure beef bacon what ever that was
