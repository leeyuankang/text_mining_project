my only complaint would be that the room in which i stayed was near to the reception desk outside seating and fire door as a result i was woken up on two or three occasions in the night with people returning back to the hotel after a night out and making noise from loud talking activity and the door closing whilst this isn t specifically the hotel s fault a policy of consideration for other guests after dark might be helpful
