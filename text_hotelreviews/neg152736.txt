even though i requested a quiet room there was still a good deal of noise from the corridors road my room faced the main road and people in other rooms also i couldn t open any of the windows which i was very disappointed with as i really dislike air conditioning the air conditioning system was quite noisy and rattled sometimes i wasn t able to adjust the temperature below degrees so i was also very hot at night as i prefer cooler temperatures the room got quite stuffy because i couldn t ventilate it with fresh air
