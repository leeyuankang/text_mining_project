as stated we got upgraded to a suit which i was stunning the only draw back is that it faces the busy road at the front of the hotel so traffic noise was quite bad at all times and the curtains did let a fair bit of light through so the room was still fairly light in the middle of the night would def go back and stay again but would request to stay in a room further into the hotel so not to be effected by the road
