on arrival i had to correct the receptionist on the price as they got it wrong and i struggled to understand them the junior suite was nicely decorated but the bathroom in room is an absolute joke there isn t enough room to stand in front of the toilet it is so tiny you have to sit on the toilet sideways as the sink and bin are in the way it is the smallest bathroom i have ever seen in all the places i have stayed really disappointed considering the cost
