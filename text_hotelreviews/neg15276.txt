the main hotel staff were lovely but those in the bar were a bit pretentious when we had a quick pre concert drink and it was quiet the lady who served us was lovely but when we returned after the event and it was busy the staff behaved as if we were an inconvenience when you re paying nearly for a beer it shouldn t be too much to ask to have a glass with it
