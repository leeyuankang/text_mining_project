we ordered room service the food was nice but not exactly as described we tried to order a mocktail the hotel doesn t serve alcohol at and was told that the kitchen had shut at so we couldn t order it seems a bit weird that a jug of juice couldn t be brought up anyway we also ordered room service from the night time menu and we got a chicken panini when it came it was stone cold so we had to re order we were given a disabled room which is fine but we didn t request that also if you say the name of the hotel to people then they tell you rumours about how it is a swingers hotel which is a little grubby feeling
