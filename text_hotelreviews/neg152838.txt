the hotel is halal which isnt that well advertised on the site this means it doesnt serve any alcohol i wasnt drinking but it is an unusual feature there was a lovely outdoor seating area that would have been lovely with a glass of wine on a sunny day the room service menu which was advertised in the room and at check in wasnt available at when we returned to the hotel instead we were given a takeaway menu not the best experience
