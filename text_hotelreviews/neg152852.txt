i didn t like the fact that my partner accidentally left his bracelet on the side of the bathroom sink in plain view for all to see and when we returned to ask if it has been handed in it hadn t even though the room had been unoccupied since we had left at midday this meant the only people who had been in the room after us had been the cleaners or another member of staff we were outraged to find that a sentimental piece of jewlerry had actually been stolen by a member of hotel staff we are both disgusted with how this happened when you are supposed to be a reputable hotel we definitely will not be returning and certainly will not be recommending this thieving institute to anybody else
