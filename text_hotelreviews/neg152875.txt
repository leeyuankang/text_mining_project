specifically requested a quiet room during the booking unfortunately the access door to the patio stayed unlock with guest smoking and talking out loud near the window of our room on top of that the food was cold so the hotel offers to give us a discount instead they charged our room twice the level of amateurism in this hotel goes beyond anything we experienced so far as frequent travellers
