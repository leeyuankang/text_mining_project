some of the bathroom floor tiles were cracked and wobbled a bit when we walked on them but everything else in the hotel was perfect the only other pointer is that the parking staff from the bingo next door where we park was unhappy we paid the old rate for parking by going to reception rather than paying the new amounts on the pay machine increased by this isnt anything the hotel can change
