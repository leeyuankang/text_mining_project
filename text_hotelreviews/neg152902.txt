although it didn t bother us it would be better if they highlighted the fact this is a halal hotel no bar no pork this was no obvious at time of booking which might impact some peoples enjoyment at check in a deposit was requested although when we paid cash upfront i booked the hotel in my name my id is in my married name i am now separated and this caused hassle and embarrassment my new partner was with me when we checked in and it was mentioned out loud at reception that i had names and i really don t think this is necessary i found this really frustrating and embarrassing they had payment and an id what more was required i felt like i had committed a crime
