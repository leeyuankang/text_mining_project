the service at breakfast wasn t that good we had to wait quite a while for our tea and coffee and even longer for the milk when it eventually arrived the tea and coffee was cold we watched a waitress wipe a table with her bare hand and then handle the cutlery which we didn t think was very hygenic considering the service wasn t that good we were not impressed with the service charge
