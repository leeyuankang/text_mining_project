in general there was not enough staff for this fully booked hotel staff were trying there best and more but you could see that they had to rush all the time indoor pool of the main reasons i booked this hotel was closed for maintanance rooftop bar another of the reasons i booked this hotel was occupied by a private party so we could not enjoy it roomservice took almost one hour to bring the food breakfast buffet was very small and limited and the option of the a la carte breakfast was not clear at all there was one menu hidden at the cash desk and only if people specifically asked for it the staff was willing to show it whole breakfast room was run by persons and this is absolutely not enough according to the size of the breakfast room if i compare same price quality hotel in for example tokyo this was truly not good hope the hotel will improve these points soon
