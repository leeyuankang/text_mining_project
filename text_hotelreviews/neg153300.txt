if tripadvisor allowed stars then this hotel would receive it i arrived to check in official time at to be told my room was not ready no apology and in fact if anything it was made to feel like it was my fault for turning up there were four staff on reception all muttering between them and all who behaved appallingly they were rude unapologetic and even contradicted themselves something another guest behind me at check in stepped in to re enforce as they clearly were also appalled at the way i was spoken to after waiting for my room it left me with just to get ready for a black tie event i was attending not what i had planned to top it off i was provided with a downgrade to the room i had booked and the room had stains on the carpet and scratched furniture and bathroom the shower handle was glued in place and would only stay on boiling hot it was totally difficult to have a comfortable shower my view was overlooking a dirty roof and a dirty street the night porter was helpful to start with and we ordered food on our return but after waiting over for a soda water and a ciabatta bread we spoke to reception and cancelled the order only to have the night porter banging on my door at in the morning telling me he knew i was in there as a female i did not feel safe in the hotel and would not recommend to anyone i worked in travel for years and now work in customer service and would imagine the staff at this hotel have received training in neither the recent five star reviews must be the staff themselves or their friends and we spoke to several other people at the hotel and everyone had something negative to say it was really dissspoainting and the worst part was that they were so defensive and no one would acknowledge how badly we had been treated
