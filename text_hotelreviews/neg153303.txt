the staff were extremely rude including the manager there was some confusion with our bar bill due to our large group however before it could be addressed i was chased out of the bar and grabbed by the barmaid demanding i pay the bill explained we would pay this however they were insistent and continued to be rude the manager smelt strongly of smoke to the point where i had to stand away the swimming pool jets did not work and it was freezing cold and the steam room was not in working order a lovely hotel but the staff need further training extremely disappointing
