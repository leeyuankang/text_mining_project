the bed was quite short and i am not a tall person also there was an issue with the air conditioning in that it would not drop below degrees in our room making it far too hot other than that the room was fab and service was great the hotel does seem to have constant music playing in communal areas and it can be loud not really necessary at breakfast etc where you might want some quiet time
