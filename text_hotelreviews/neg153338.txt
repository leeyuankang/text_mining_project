unfortunately tv in bathroom and hand held computer did not work but as we were only booked in for night it was not an issue we were also asked if our stay was for a special occasion which it was my wife s birthday and was told that something nice could be arranged but nothing was done just felt that if nothing was going to be arranged then please do not ask the quest that question
