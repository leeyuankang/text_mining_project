breakfast was very poor cold plates cold food and poorly cooked no toast other than by using a diy toaster my toast was stolen by another guest and poor service very low grade not star you can get a much better breakfast for less money at nearby cafes i told the staff this on check out but no response from management to my home telephone or email after five days despite assurances that my comments would be passed on clearly a hotel that pays no attention to guest s comments we shall not return here is a tip the nearby hoxton hotel offer much better value for money
