the only negative was that in our room there was a large orange pink stain on the floor next to our bed which i hate to say looked like vomit the stain looked to have been cleaned but it was definitely still visible so i was really disappointed about this as we were only staying for one night and had been traveling i didn t want to make a fuss to be moved but i did place a towel over the area
