it lacked in the finer touches you would usually expect of a hotel in my opinion the hotel is a the hairdryers should be replaced it is one of those awful ones where you need to keep your finger on the button for it to work our minibar was a cupboard with a bottle of tap water there wasn t even a fridge tea and coffee making facilities are in the room but i ve been in other lower rated hotels where they have nespresso machines this would be a nice touch a bath would also be a good addition sometimes a shower just doesn t cut it at a hotel and the robes look like they were made for children so it does lack a little luxury
