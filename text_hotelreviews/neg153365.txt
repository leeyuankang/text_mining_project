although some staff were wonderful the hotel clearly lacks a well structured central management that is a must for a hotel that claims to be some staff are wearing casual clothing or check facebook on their iphones in front of guests at breakfast it was all very chaotic and nobody seemed to be informed who should do what one staff member one night even complained to us about long working hours and the lack of motivation of fellow co workers shockingly unprofessional for such a hotel for the price charged i would strongly recommend other hotels in london
