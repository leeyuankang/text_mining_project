the staff too young seemed inexperienced breakfast was a perfect example of total disorganisation two girls running around like headless chickens had to ask times for simple porridge request we stayed here last year and we re hoping that the staff issues had been sorted as the hotel had just opened sadly it has not even the manager looked young there was a private party on the saturday night and the residents couldn t get served in the bar we got shoved into a side room and forgotten ended up going out all in all the place needs a focused management approach or they re not going to get repeat business shame
