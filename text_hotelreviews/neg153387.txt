the front of house staff member checking me was dealing with me in quite a rude and dismissive way almost like i didn t deserve to be there it was pretentious i also booked it with the pay nothing until check in but i was told that they took a pre authorisation of the amount for the room and required a further for cover then asked for id for me and my girlfriend when i asked why it was met with another i m better than you response i ve stayed in far nicer hotels that have cost a lot lot more and equally some that have cost a lot less and this was bar far the worst front of house service i have received i stayed at the m by montcalm tech hotel last month and that was much better
