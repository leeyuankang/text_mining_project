there was no information pack in my room on breakfast times spa visits etc etc the team at breakfast need much more training i had paid in advance for breakfast but everthing appeared to be to order there was an empty buffet station with a few pre prepared fruit salads and a plate of pastries but no invitation to help myself i asked for hot water and lemon instead of tea or coffee first time round i got a glass of cold water and lemon and next time i got a single cup of hot water with lemon on the side i would have liked a pot of hot water and some lemon slices it also would have been nice to be offered juice i did make it clear when i arrived that i had pre paid for breakfast there were people in for breakfast and three staff i asked for bercher museli and salmon and scrambled eggs they were both delicious but i saw them arrive and sit on the side for several minutes as no one seemed to know who they were for then they were delivered to me at the same time and by then the eggs were quite cold there was no offer of toast to accompany it looking at the menu what i ordered would have cost me less if i had ordered them individually the waiter and waitresses were very polite but seemed completely uncomfortable in their domain it was a big disappointment after every other aspect of my stay had been without fault if i stayed again i would not pre pay for breakfast on this experience
