the hotel is very new and still lacks some of the decor that would make it feel more lived in i would suggest having a centerpiece in the main hall with more seating to make it more welcoming restaurant is not running smoothly yet as the restaurant manager and waiters don t seem to know what they are doing the food is great but i would have liked to see more healthy options the spa is lovely and new but still not fully functioning as there is no staff there surely all the kinks will be worked out with time
