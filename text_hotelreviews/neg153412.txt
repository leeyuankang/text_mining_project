on checking in at reception staff seemed new to their roles as he was rather slow checking us in i think they may have been in training perhaps also language barrier bit problematic perhaps our accents irish confusing for the staff maybe also main bar needs to be restocked very poor selections of drinks available informed by another couple that their evening meal on friday at took almost an hour to be served when this one couple were the only ones in the restaurant housekeeping let us down as they forgot to restock t tray which had no tea nor biscuits no coffee in our friends room either
