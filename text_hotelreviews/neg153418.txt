the staff were overbearing judgemental and went out of their way to say no everytime we passed the front desk we were stared at and at times it was very uncomfortable upon arrival we were shown around the hotel by a lovely guy who showed us all the facilities available in particular the roof terrace with beautiful views i asked if i could go up there to take some photos and was told no problem the next day when i asked to go up i was told no i explained i had been told i could and again rather rudely i was told no by a manager they had let other guests up previously there were more staff than beds and one of them could have taken us up there might seem a little thing but what is the point of showing me something i then can t use with no explanation it was a very expensive trip and considered a real treat i was a little disappointed we were not treated better particularly as there were only guests that weekend it really is the service that makes the stay saying that there were staff who were lovely and helped to redeem some of my disappointment the guy at the desk was great with directions and taking the time to let us know where to go the guy on arrival was great and very helpful nothing was an issue he seemed very embarrassed when we were told we could not go on the roof terrace no robes in the room quickly rectified but a small detail that i shouldn t have to ask for kettle had to be used on the floor as that was the only available plug point teabags and mini pots of milk hate that again a small detail but for the cost of the room the tea and coffee facilities were reminiscent of a travel lodge i would stay again in the hope the manager uses all the feedback positively and perhaps some of these issues were teething problems due to opening the building really is beautiful the older part has more atmosphere and charm
