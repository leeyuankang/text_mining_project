prior to arriving we had been offered a complementary bottle of champagne for the room but there was only one glass provided i was also offered the opportunity to have a message written on the mirror in the room which i thought was really lovely but it didn t happen no message on any mirror the complementary toiletries had been used a couple of them were half full what i would like to say is when spending that kind of money which to us is a major treat we are not flush in anyway have saved for ages for this occasion you hope attention to detail would be made but we were offered a room upgrade on check in so that was lovely for us and being given that kind of service how can you complain it was fantastic the above mini negative comments are observations only and in no way a complaint x
