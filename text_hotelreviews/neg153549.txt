whilst the room was great it was close to the penthouse from for over hours there were room doors being constantly knocked at doors opened and closed people in and out chatting in the hall way and mobile phones ringing if the noise was from the penthouse maybe it would benefit from having direct access from the lift and not from the same hall way as other paying customers disappointed not to have had a good nights sleep
