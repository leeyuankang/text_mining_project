this stylish luxury hotel is in a fantastic location and is stunning however we had very poor service in the bar we ordered bar food it took minutes to arrive was average at best despite the prices i deliberately took off the service charge when i signed the bill in check out found it had been put back on i complained and the service charge was removed but frankly i expect better response to poor service in a hotel of this standard
