as above for the price paid for the hotel you don t get lot for your money bin was not empty on arrival had to wave down my own cab on leaving hotel open the main door myself no concierge in site i paid a lot off money for a nice view which does not even have shelter for the english rainy days no water or fruit within rooms on arrival had to return to reception twice on arrival as door card not working in the end just accepted to use the one card rather than one each for my wife and i very noisy from bar above an overall very bad stay and disappointed in the hotel itself feel like i was robbed in broad daylight with your exspensive rates
