we was a bit disappointed with the radio rooftop bar as thought it would be a nice relaxed chilled place to have a drink and enjoy the view instead the staff on the podium were very unhappy and asked us to move from a table even though it didn t have a reserved plaque on it music was a bit to loud we were shouting at each other just to have a conversation
