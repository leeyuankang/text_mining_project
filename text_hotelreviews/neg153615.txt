the only thing that i personally did not like was that we were told we have access to the rooftop bar when we went the lady downstairs told us to come back after mins since there was other people from outside the hotel in front of us i thought she should have let us in before them instead of making us wait since we are already residents in the hotel and should have immediate access and saw us coming down the elevator
