the bar staff on the top floor are not as sophisticated nice or professional as staff elsewhere in the hotel i assume this is because they are dealing with drunk people in general the top floor bar is quite pretentious we attended it on a friday night between and the music was shocking pop for teenagers the atmosphere pretentious the clientele well put it this way there are better places to party but if you want a convenient drink late at night then do pay it a visit
