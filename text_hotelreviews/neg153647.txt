sdk restaurant tries to be a club and a restaurant which means it s difficult to talk over the music in addition our table was right next to the bar there was a ledge behind our seats that people rested their drinks on one of these drinks was knocked over luckily not on any of us this strikes me as poor design as you must have complaints from diners at that table every weekend i d remove the shelf if possible
