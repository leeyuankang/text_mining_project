ha a great time in the rooftop bar but you have to have a table bar staff will ignore you other wise would be better if they made a policy it was table service only they also ask very frequently if you want more drinks not quite pushy but certainly buying drinks secured your seat don t get me wrong it was an amazing place just a little thing that could easily be settled
