lack of internal signage meant i couldn t locate studio i thought gym was only facility and it was squashed and average the communal spaces of hotel corridor etc too dark doors to bedroom too heavy unsuitable for anyone of average strength door not self closing making a fire hazard bathroom didn t have bin or hook to hang robe bedroom had coffee machine but no tea making facility breakfast was chaos and i wasn t shown the buffet so thought the menu was it basically all just ill thought out
