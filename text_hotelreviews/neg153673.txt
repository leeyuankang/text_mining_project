the standard rooms were not worth the price the mayfair hotel is less and i think it is better with bigger rooms as standard if you have the money i would suggest staying here but in a suite or a deluxe room if you don t i would go the mayfair hotel as it is better value both are premium hotels and aren t cheap but the room size at me hotel is disappointing for the price
