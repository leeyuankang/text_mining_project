there was no welcome into the room after waiting so long i had to call for my luggage they knew that i was traveling with my children but they didn t supply any extras to accommodate them i had to ask for everything from extra cups glasses bathrobes slippers they gave me only one water to share so i had to ask for more the connector where i connect my ipod was obviously damaged and i had to wait around for someone to come and fix it twice so it was very difficult to relax in the room my previous experience at the me was excellent but this time my children nor i enjoyed our stay here
