service was dire the hotel can t cope with a full compliment of guests totally disorganised staff were polite and apologetic but waiting times were long we were waiting mins to get served in the restaurant and we told them when booking we needed a reasonable turnaround we had to leave in the end without eating or we would have missed the show they should be more honest when taking your table booking we would have been happy to eat elsewhere and would have left with a better impression of the hotel many of the guests were complaining some had been waiting mins and still nothing on the table
