this is an expensive hotel with high standard furnishings facilities etc what a pity then that the service could be so much better once you managed to get someone to serve you they were excellent but getting someone to come to you is the problem not enough staff in relation to guests at breakfast customers were made to wait while tables were cleared despite the fact that the tables had been vacated some considerable time earlier finally when checking in they promote the skybar on floor we attempted to do this after the show we had been to waited for a lift as they were very busy only to be told the skybar was full when we reached the floor customers should have been alerted in reception area not good customer service
