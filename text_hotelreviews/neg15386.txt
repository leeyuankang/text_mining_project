the sky bar was full which wasn t a problem as they said it is first come first served however they could have told the queue of people waiting by the lifts downstairs so they didn t waste their time and then the barman in the clipper bar tried to serve someone who arrived after me despite me telling him i was there first in the end he served us both but the queue jumper got his drinks first and then paid first i say barman he was wearing a suit and looked more like a manager very rude and not what i expect from such an expensive bar it wouldn t have been so bad if we weren t left waiting so long to be served previous to this as they didn t have enough staff to cope with the post concert rush
