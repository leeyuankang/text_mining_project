as a lot of guests were staying because of the concert at having so few staff serving in the bars afterward was short sighted we waited minutes in the merdian bar and still had not been able to order the same for many other guests then we then left and went to the sky bar and were not even allowed in as we were told it was full we then went to the clipper bar and got served after about minutes but had to stand and whilst i do not like to complain that is unreasonable in a star hotel at the prices you charge and my girlfriend is months pregnant i don t even have to wait that long in a premier inn a lot of other people also got fed up and left without being served so it isn t just us that were fed up at being ignored
