no air conditioning we thought that it would be ok because was supposed to be in the low high few days and only and then few others even with in the windows wide open and there is little air in the room on the third floor it was unbearably hot and we did not sleep well the entire time we were there staff was nice we ended up getting three fans instead of one and it was still awful because of that i would never stay at this property or any other non ac property in london again during the summer the lobby is tiny with just a few sets of chairs and a small couch
