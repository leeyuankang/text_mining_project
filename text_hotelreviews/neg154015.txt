we were upset because of accommodating us on the basement floor with the view to the stone wall i think guests shall be informed about such possible surprises and be able to choose the room in advance staff was neither pleasant or unpleasant we didn t catch a single emotion from them during our stay rooms were quite small and had views scratches on the furniture unsteady table dirty or corrupted ceramic tiles in the bathroom etc because of the basement floor there was a noise above us specially in the morning from the kitchen i guess our neighbors were also complaining on that kettle is weirdly placed in the small locker with the wire fixed to it so it s impossible to move it around hopefully we were spending the whole day outside and used the hotel room only for a sleep price is somewhat high for the overall quality of service nothing was really wonderful
