the room was steaming hot not even after we told the staff the first morning to cool it down anything happened moreover they closed the window manager ich we had specifically asked to keep open other guests also complained but obviously in vain the room was in the basement floodlights lit the room all night no view more noisy street smelly entrance the rooms are old and dated and and urgently need refreshment the bar is merely a corner of the reception area
