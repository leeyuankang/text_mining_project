like many overpriced london hotels this one also puts an individual traveller in the smallest attic room they have and that for pounds there were even spider webs between the bed and the wall they probably wait until they can put someone in that room on top of this the room was noisy other guests pacing around in their room was very audible definitely many negative points on my scale
