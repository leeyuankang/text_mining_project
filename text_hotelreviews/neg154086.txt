i booked this hotel for my manager who was staying in london for company business but brought her family as it was during the summer holidays the sofa bed i was told was comfortable was not but this was quickly substituted the reason for such a low rating a customer service at reception was very poor b they did not order a taxi when requested which meant they almost missed their flight and c when a follow up call was requested to discuss issue the manager could not even be bothered to call i will not be booking this hotel for any of our executives and would not recommend it to colleagues or friends either
