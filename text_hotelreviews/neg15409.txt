i had included breakfast in our stay on booking com and even upgraded our stay to ensure this however on going down to breakfast we were advised this was not included and i would need to pay per person when i checked my confirmation email there was nothing to confirm i had selected this option i am sure however i had selected this on booking com as there was the green icon breakfast included and when i pressed book it had another breakfast included icon to confirm again i found this really embarrassing on checking out we were charged full english breakfasts each where i only had the continental i had confirmed this with the waiters at the time and advised i only had a bowl of porridge the staff on checkout were not too helpful and tried to advise breakfast included means you still have to pay they seemed very put out and made many phone calls in clarifying what i had that morning they finally charged me for my continental however this was which is a very expensive bowl of porridge i ve lost my trust in booking com as it cost me a lot more than i had budgeted and there was nothing to defend me i didn t find the member of staff on checkout helpful in this matter
