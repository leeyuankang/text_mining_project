i didn t have sky sports in the room not a major issues but after a day of travel me my wife son where tired and wanted to head back to the room there was big premier league game on and i couldn t watch it and none of the bars in the hotel seemed to have a tv but as i said it was only a minor grip and did not impact on the rest of a very enjoyable stay in a top hotel
