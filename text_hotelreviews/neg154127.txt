we ordered several room service items including nachos pizza i was violently ill during the night i had serve abdominal pain was throwing up and had diarrhoea my partner was fine and had to spend the night helping me as he never ate the sausages and mash potatoes i am sure that is what gave me the food poisoning even when i was eating it the food looked as if it had been reheated i spoke to the hotel staff in the morning when we checked out after telling them i was ill they still wanted us to pay for the food we ate only when my partner kicked up a fuss did they accept that we should not i told them i wanted to raise a complaint as the food they have served me had made me ill i was called and told that as no one else was ill there was nothing they could do i told them that they had not dealt with my complaint and i wanted a written response from them i still haven t received any written response from the hotel i wanted the hotel to resolve this issue so that i didn t have to write this review it s a shame they never bothered
