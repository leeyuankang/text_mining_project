the room was on the basement and had no natural light only a window that lead to a covered patio full of garbage they offered us to change the room on the last night but we refused because the packing and unpacking would interfere with our plans although the heaters were disconnected the heat was unbearable and we had to sleep with the window opened in the middle of december we couldn t sleep after our upstairs neighbors woke up because of the sound and trembling provoked by the footsteps i m not even sure if the ceiling is in a safe condition although it claims to be a star hotel the room didn t have a minibar or even a safe
