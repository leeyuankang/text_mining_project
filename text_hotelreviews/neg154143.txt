we booked the clarendon grange hotel based on booking com reviews but on arrival we were told that we had been upgraded to the nearby portland hotel we have no complaints about the portland all was perfectly ok except that if we wanted breakfast we had to leave the portland hotel walk down the road to the clarendon which was not ideal
