we ordered room service on our first evening i ordered an angus burger and chips when it came i could not cut it so took the top bread off still could not cut it and noticed how thin it was i tried to bite it but couldn t i phoned reception they apologised i explained it was not an angus burger and to me i felt it had been a cheap microwaved burger i awaited for a repeat order my husband had finished his pizza so i went down stairs with my plate re literates what i had said and the reception informed me it was on its way and as compensation would i like a bottled water or juice i said no thank you however felt it was not much of an apology gesture i then ate on my own and only had half the portion of chips than before which i left on the plate with the first burger so maybe it should have been a free meal due to the burger not being what was advertised having to re order and eating on my own
