the prices were very high in the bar for drinks as well as the breakfast which was for or each this priced us out the breakfast which was not ideal as we did not want to pay that figure the mini bar in the room and its contents were expensive so we did not partake in these particularly for a can of coke or finger kitkat so that was a bit frustrating a small bottle of wine chardonnay was from the minibar which equates to about medium glasses so a glass overall good price for the room of but some of the extras were expensive
