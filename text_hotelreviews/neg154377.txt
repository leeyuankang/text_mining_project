poor maintenance hassles to get problems solved desk staff tried but there was little interest in resolving them from management we paid in advance for night stay very dirty floors in room water on bathroom floor after showering due to poor design requiring covering floor with towels very expensive restaurant any other hotel we ve experienced would have tried to make us happy via a minor upgrade but they just put us in another identical room property has been updated but they used unskilled labor and work was done very poorly
