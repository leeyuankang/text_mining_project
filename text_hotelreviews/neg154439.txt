it was unusually hot while we were there and the level room we were initially given remained at deg c despite the air con being set to and all options set to give maximum effect we could not sleep under these conditions and a request to change rooms was very rapidly dealt with we were at first offered a basement room these look really nice actually and then a very nice room on the level which proved superb so this is hardly a criticism more a warning that the air con is not effective on the uppermost floors and you might want to avoid these if you re not used to sleeping in a hot room check with the hotel though they are aware there is a problem and considering the way they responded to all our needs i would not be at all surprised if they did not rectify this problem very soon
