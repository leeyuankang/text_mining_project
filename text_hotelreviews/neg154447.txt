the room was small i specifically booked this as advertised as a boutique hotel under the rules that there policy was not to book large parties there were quite a few large parties and they invaded people space on one occasion they even took my seat when i went for toast it also meant it took minutes to get a coffee at breakfast and even longer for breakfast to arrive i will be writing a review on trip advisor as this was miss sold to me as a boutique hotel with no large parties
