unfortunately the fridge kept us up all night it was very loud also breakfast wasn t really eaten my partner could not eat his fried egg as was so under cooked it was gloopy on his plate it was cold on arrival i had to get up and ask for sugar and a spoon by this time i took a knife of another table instead of a asking again and when i asked for butter i waited ages before another waiter come over and i said again i wanted butter by this time my toast was also cold you expect more for the price
