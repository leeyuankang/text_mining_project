the toilet had a stale water smell that empowered the room on arrival and the air conditioning did not appear to be functioning properly with the heating only turning on despite setting it to on till eleven pm this meat the room was stone cold on arrival and not very welcoming the staff on reception lacked continuity off quality customer service at times being friendly and helpful and at other times i felt uninterested and unhelpful these were the only factors that prevent me from giving it s top rating and that lowered the comfort of our stay
