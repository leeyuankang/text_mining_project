hygiene problem we found mold in our breakfast jam jar after the incident we tried to cancel our breakfast for the next coming days but they refused to and said they will consider it not until we rreported to ihg in regards to this issue then the hotel agreed to refund the breakfast broken glass in the hallway outside our room for two days we saw the broken glass and expected someone to clean it up but no one had it cleaned until we reported to the reception to avoid any severe injuries housekeeping was not trained well the doors were not closed properly after service many times and room supplies was not properly filled everyday we had to remind them to bring certain things that they forgot to put in our room everyday not to mention the organization of the room regarding the bed sheets things on the table were not properly placed guest relations they did not solve any problems of which we complained about until we reached ihg during check out i had to argue with the guest relation staff member about the cancelled breakfast that i had confirmed days ago service and attitude was disappointing
