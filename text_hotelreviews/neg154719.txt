we got late by couple of hours in checking out manager at the reception got so rude with us raised his voice and got annoyed to say this is not done i felt as if i had committed a crime such people are complete misfit in hospitality industry then there was an issue with drain pipe in restroom which they fixed after several reminders thanks to indonesian mgr who came to our rescue will go down as very bad stay for us had it not been for that person
