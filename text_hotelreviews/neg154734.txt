eggs eggs eggs we stayed at novotel hotels this summer in france and whilst the breakfast was mostly great the scrambled eggs tasted synthetic and like they were out of a packet they taste terrible and given the fact that bowl was offered full to the brim i think we were not the only people that didn t like them and that the hotels have a lot of waste of this item
