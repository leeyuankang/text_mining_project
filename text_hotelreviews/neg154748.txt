although we booked for adults and children baby and requested baby cot the staff were not aware that we did book a family room and did not supply with a cot until later on unfortunately even then the cot did not have a mattress and the sheets were left inside for us to make it for this reason our baby had to sleep with us in bed which originated not much sleep for mummy as we were afraid she will fall off the bed disappointing
