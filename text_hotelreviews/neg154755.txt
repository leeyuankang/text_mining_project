upon check in saturday we were told that breakfast was and were never informed that this was weekends only so on our last day when we fancied a lie in and went down at we were refused entry to breakfast informing us breakfast closed at we explained the issue so the member of staff offered us a free of charge bar breakfast unfortunately though this was an orange juice croissant and very bitter fruit it was better than nothing but still had to go and get breakfast elsewhere
