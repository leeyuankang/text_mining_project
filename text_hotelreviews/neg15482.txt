it is quite windy at the location i wanted to sit out smoke and have a drink but the staff wouldnt accomodate this also we came back from the concert sat in the clipper bar they werent serving food but we did ask if we could order form room service and eat in bar and they wouldnt allow this there needs to be a little more flexibility with customers
