helicopters flying outside my bedroom window for hours so couldn t sleep kept waking me up it was constant and very loud for the pleasure of staff didn t talk to me other than quick basics at check in and check out didn t even ask how my stay was so didn t get a chance to give feedback so disappointed as expected alot more as i wanted to treat my partner to a spa weekend but was ruined by not being advised an army of helicopters will be feet from my bed so didn t even bother to try it
