although i am all in for planet care it was way to dark in the bath room wall next to the toilet has not been cleaned in a while as it was soiled when we arrived hotel is very hard to find needs better signage events during the second and third night might give the impression that the rooms are sold hourly had to go to the reception at am and ask for security no apologies from hotel staff
