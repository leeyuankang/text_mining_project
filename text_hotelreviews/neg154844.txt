we had previously stayed at this hotel in november for my birthday and really enjoyed it therefore we booked to return back in june for my partner s birthday however our return back was awful the staff were rude and unhelpful the room was not as expected no view the layout was not as any of the pictures shown on booking com we then had to upgrade our room at an additional expense like the junior suite wasn t costing us alot of money already we will not be returning back the duty manager kuman was extremely rude and very very unhelpful we checked in around and we were in the lobby with the duty manager u ntil approx and nothing was being done to resolve our issue during our hours in the lobby there were other client complaints regarding their room and their stay
