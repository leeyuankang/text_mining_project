there was no hot watercoming out the shower as it was going warm to cold and then warm then cold again and when i told them about it they said it was regulation that they have the water set at that temperature so me and my partner were shivering when we got out the shower also when i brought them up on it the receptionist tried down grading me also i couldn t ring through to get room service so ever time i wanted something i would have to go to the reception and ask for it myself i don t think what i got was or worth a night i was not happy with my stay and would like to speak to the head office of the company and resolve this matter as paying for things to go wrong isn t my ideas of good hospitality
