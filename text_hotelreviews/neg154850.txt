the light tv system was a bit complicated with no real instructions on how to use the tv in the bathroom was just not working properly we just had to hit the remote in hopes it would turn off as the on switch was not working was quite warm in the room even with the ac on the lowest setting the mini bar is quite expensive but i guess that is to be expected
