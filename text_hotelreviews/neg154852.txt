unhelpful staff wanted to charge me to extend my check out time by an hour unwelcoming receptionists with very poor english dark corridors even darker stuffy rooms and no way of opening any windows so stuck with ac no tube close by so everywhere had to get taxis best bit was the comfy bed and deal off all meals in restaurant in evening hotel was a real let down
