i am not happy about the fact that on checking in i was asked to pay deposit which was taken off my debit card to cover any accidents or costs of using the mini bar i think this should have been made clear in the booking confirmation to prepare the customers and this shouldn t be compulsory the staff told me it was compulsory that i had to make the deposit what happened to freedom of choice not everyone would want to use the mini bar i ended up paying for two nights including the extra charge which i didn t plan for i only planned on paying what would have happened if the customer didn t have the extra deposit money
