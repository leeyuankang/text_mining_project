being awoken at in the morning by the window cleaner who thought it was acceptable to tap the window with his equipment for over minutes i raised this with the reception desk later in the morning and was told that luckily the window cleaner comes only once or twice a month so this shouldn t be an issue tomorrow the staff seemed to just accept that i d had a very rude awakening when checking out after two nights i was again asked about my stay and i brought up the issue with the window cleaner again and for a second time the staff seemed completely unconcerned for my discomfort i guess they d already taken my money so they were happy
