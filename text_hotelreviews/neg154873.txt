the location was a pain to get to most places it s about bus ride to the nearest tube we took public transport with huge luggage and a kid it was a pain a transfer from the airport would have been great the shower was a strange thing no matter how i adjust it it went from cold to hot then really hot i had to time to get in to wash myself it was a pain the air con couldn t be switched off so it was really cold at night without a heater
