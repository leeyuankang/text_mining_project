the hotel staff was rude or didn t have a clue not a star hotel needs to improved so much the nights we was there was awful the swimming pool was in construction and didn t say that on there website or on booking com and urban view should state your going to look at a car park and be more clear about it too the room was not clean too and the mini bar never got replenished we used up all the milk and didn t get new milk for teas or coffees they won t take the food away until the next day if you get room service too not a star hotel needs a lot of work and staff need training too
