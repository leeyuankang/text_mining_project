i had high hopes for this hotel but a complete waste of money it does not live up to its star rating at all there are far better hotels in london the cleanliness of our room was not impeccable as you would expect in a hotel of that standing and i have found better in premier inns the bed is good but the room was far too hot and could not turn the temperature down more than a couple of degrees so ended up calling reception in the early morning so we could finally get some sleep the worst was the restaurant food heated up not fresh and barely edible the chairs in the dining room were chipped and the tables outside were dusty such a let down that i will not be booking again
