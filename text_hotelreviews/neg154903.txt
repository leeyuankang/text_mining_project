spa facilities are limited with the controls for the jacuzzi not working properly the pool was out of use but looked small the room temp control wasn t the best as we still felt cold the tv in the bathroom was not working but we didnt need it the tv in the room was in an awkard place amd not adjustable would also be better if the audio dock was closer to the bed area for control or if a wireless option was available the hotel is also in an area without much around need to travel to clapham area for restaurants and shops
