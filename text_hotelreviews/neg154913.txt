not happy that the minibar deposit was not mentioned in our booking being treated as a potential thief was a deeply unpleasant way to begin our stay we ve never had to pay a deposit before and the onus on the hotel is to recover the monies from guests who do abuse the minibar as opposed to making honest guests pay a deposit because of the actions of others i d also add that charging for coffee pods is exceptionally mean spirited secondly the heating was not adjustable below degrees this is not very green despite the hotels claim to be so finally some members of staff were dour and unwelcoming this needs to be addressed as it is not pleasant to be greeted with sullen unsmiling staff members
