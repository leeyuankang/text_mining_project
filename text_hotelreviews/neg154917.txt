the hotel itself was confusing it was apartments and a hotel which wasn t stated when booking and when i arrived it looked a mess from the outside as the apartments at the top looked like it was a dumping ground for furniture there was no clear entrance for parking or the hotel and we were greeted by a woman who was anything but warm after a couple of minutes she became helpful however never cracked a smile or made us feel welcome the bathroom had hair all in the shower which made us not want to use it our room was nice clean and spacious but our view was tainted by it literally being face to face with the gym window so i had to be careful when walking around getting changed as people on the tredmills could see me very clearly the whole reason i booked the hotel was because of the spa facilities however the hydropool was out of use which we weren t told and so we cancelled our bookings because we wanted to relax in the pool and we re disappointed we weren t told until check in as this would of changed my mind on the hotel we ordered breakfast room service and ordered tea even though it was free in our room because we wanted larger mugs when it arrived we had no cutlery no cups no spoons no toast so i called downstairs to tell reception which took calls because no one answered and they gave me attitude because i asked for cups and cutlery after minutes we received our cutlery and toast etc however the man delivering it really didn t believe me and came into the room without me allowing him even though i was not dressed comfortably for this on check out i had to pay for the breakfast and the tea and it was not worth the money for the hassle i felt stressed leaving which i shouldn t have
