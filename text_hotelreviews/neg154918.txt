location is what it is but was not great access was tough and hard to find especially for taxi drivers the hotel is not even if i owned it and was trying to big it up i would be embarrassed to called it the place was badly designed grubby and had a whole host of random pieces of furniture everywhere very odd the rooms were not very clean badly maintained and corners had obviously been cut in every aspect sure signs of a hotel not making money or management who simply don t care very poor
