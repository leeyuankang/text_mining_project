staff were rude unprofessional not helpful and non chalon i tried to set a romantic jacuzzi for my husband the sprinklers were activated and we were drenched along with our macbook clothes and food ruining our anniversary the staff moved us next door but we were given nothing complimentary in fact we were made to feel like it was our fault and were promptly asked to leave at we have stayed in hotels around the world and have never been made to feel like this after spending a night for a room we would have attest expected a complimentary breakfast this hotel is horrible and i pity anyone prepared to invest there hard earned money into a shambles such as this we are horrified and will never be returning here
