minor grumble is the lighting despite this being our forth visit we can never quite get the hang of it our view wasn t great the river view rooms are nicer but cost more i think is more than enough and wouldn t pay the extra there s nowhere to sit and do your makeup there s a desk but no mirror above it it s a small thing but would have made so much difference to me
