my partner and eye fancied a staycation so we booked the junior suite room we specified that we get that particular room since we had stayed previously stayed in that room we were told it had been sorted but on arrival that hadn t been done and staff doubted us when we said we called and made the request after being given the room we went up and the room smelt of weed and smoke and had two single beds still in the room from the previous guests who checked out we have stayed at this hotel before and loved it hence going back but i am afraid to say that we won t be returning after this experience
