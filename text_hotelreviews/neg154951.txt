i wanted to pay cash for my room as i had lost my credit card the day before i wasn t allowed to do so because a deposit had to be taken via a credit card i offered double the room rate as a deposit in cash but the reception staff refused even though i had called the hotel prior to my arrival to explain my situation and assured i would be able to pay cash on arrival add this to the fact the staff were extremely rude and that we had travelled from swansea and this was xmas day needless to say we weren t impressed
