not like any hotel i ve ever stayed in before that said it was good value for a a three star price and experience didn t like the atmospheric lighting the hotel and rooms are badly lit didn t like the noise from the party on of the three nights we stayed we moved rooms but didn t really help charging for using a coffee pod on the room is pretty cheap
