i would say that this hotel is like a fake luis vuitton bag it might look from distance the real deal but the closer you look the more it is evident why you pay a cheap price for it everything is done with equipment that looks potentially good but is cheap installed badly and it is terribly poor maintained there were broken things everywhere in our room shower not working bedside lights half hanging electricity sockets that pulls out of the walls end much much more i just gave up in looking around we where in the new built part of the hotel in a superior room the rooms where also not clean enough if compared to any above stars hotel i stayed in just forget about a stars and i do travel a lot and have been to plenty of and stars in my life it is a huge shame because the room with some tlc could be very nice the staff is nice and you could see that they have no much power in what is going on and really not sure what to say rather than apologise spend some money to put it right tight owners of this hotel please
