the apartment i was okay but dated and worn for example some lights didn t work the carpet had worn patches the bin lid didn t open when you pressed it there was a manual for a coffee machine but no coffee machine inside of cupboard had loose panels the tv didn t have very many channels e g no bbc one the non smoking rooms smelt of cigarette smoke whilst housekeeping came daily to replace towels they never made the bed i stayed nights there was no shower cap and a very limited mini bar which seemed a bit strange for a star hotel overall it was okay but it didn t look anything like the room photos on booking com i shared all this with the staff when checking out and they said that using the next door apartments is a new thing they are testing and that the normal hotel rooms look like the website in which case i d suggest you make sure you are in the hotel bit and not the apartment bit
