housekeeping was appalling and had to highlight this with pictures of how badly the room had been cleaned following asking several times for it to be done waited hours for diet cokes and only received them when calling reception for a time no booking made for our dinner reservation despite being told it had been dealt with for us as we were on our anniversary weekend discussed our disappointment with the reservations team on checking out and were advised we would receive a call back to discuss further but almost one month later still no call have now sadly cancelled a booking for our birthdays in november due to the poor customer care
