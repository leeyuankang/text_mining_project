the reception desk is under staffed and cluttered my partner and i who are both very tall were put in the room with accessible features the disabled access room without being informed the sink is roughly at knee height there is no shelf to put any toiletries unless you want to lean over the toilet and the toilet itself is so close to the sink that our long legs could barely squeeze in the shower had weird tacky stickers on the floor and the disabled handles inside it were covered in grime sorry just not good enough for star
