first of all when we arrived late the reception guy gives us an apartment flat which is not what we booked for and it was under the average as well so we returned to him and asked for our hotel room which we had booked through booking com and we found that the room has been taking by other people so they upgraded our room from the deluxe double room to the junior suite which is much better than the ugly apartment secondly because we did not accept the apartment they give us a room in the ground floor with ugly view actually their is not any view a all thirdly the staffs were unhelpful as we called them many time and they keep saying we are coming and no one comes until we went to them in the reception fourthly the air condition was on all the time we tried many times to turn it off but it did not as their was a problem with their system finally the spa was close only the gym and swimming pool are open while the other parts are close because the staffs are off that day
