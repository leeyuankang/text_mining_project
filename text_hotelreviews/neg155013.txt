i don t know if i m being a bit fussy but i felt like the hotel lacked soul decor was bland staff a bit diffident never rude but not particularly welcoming either nor especially on the ball for example i had room service food wasn t great and the waiter asked me to sign a slip but hadn t brought a pen with him we had asked for hour early check in which they said should be ok but then wasn t possible upon our arrival so we dropped our baggage off and told them we would be back late that evening they didn t bother to take it up to the room for us the room was poorly laid out e g no electricity points near the bed light switches not easy to find light in the bathroom was this horrible fluorescent style white light not at all relaxing no complementary water or tea which just felt cheap to be honest no shower gel just shampoo long corridors with no signs so it s hard to find your way around all niggles really but when you add together make the experience underwhelming which is not what you expect when you pay for a suite it wasn t terrible but nor was it great in fairness i didn t try to the spa so maybe that would have made a difference
