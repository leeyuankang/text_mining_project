the bath tub wasn t the best could not drain water efficiently and the taps for the shower could come off when you are opening for the water the airconditioning was too noisy at night and you could only breath the fun directly from the bed so uncomfortable for someone who is sensitive and affected by ac blowing too much could have put the ac outlet in a more better place not close to bed too expensive for the restaurant forced to eat course meal to have a discount
