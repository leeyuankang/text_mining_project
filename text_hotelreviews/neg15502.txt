staff in the meridian cafe on site were lovely friendly attentive and professional by contrast staff serving at breakfast time in the market brasserie were somewhat sullen and the level of service was nowhere near as good we requested an extra pot of coffee and were met almost with disbelief it then took minutes to arrive and it wasn t busy at the time staff were also slow to clear away used plates i did manage to get a smile out of one waiter on our second day but that was a rarity at breakfast time
