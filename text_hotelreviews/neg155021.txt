upon arrival we was challenged with a bill of deposit which broke down to a room per day this was not in our booking confirmation staff were attentive through our stay but a receptionist under the name fahad was very very disrespectful he had try charge us extra for things we had already payed for when challenging him on this and showed proof he still denied our claims after a good minute battle he had agreed that everything we used had been payed for but still no apology was made
