the only downside of our stay was when we went for breakfast we walked to the restaurant and stood in the doorway assuming that we would be greeted by staff and seen to a table there were staff behind the bar both of whom looked at use stood there waiting and they just carried on with their argument only when i walked right up to the bar and asked if this was the right place for breakfast was i told to go and find a table the service wasn t great we were simply asked if we wanted a continental or cooked breakfast some subsequent guests were offered a menu of the offerings so we felt that we weren t terribly well informed of the options available again when i asked about cereal and juice we were told to go and help ourselves the food was very tasty and extremely well prepared so full marks to the kitchen staff the waiting staff however could do with a course in how to handle guests bothersome though they are
