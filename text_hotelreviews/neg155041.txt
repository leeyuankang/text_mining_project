rooms were noisy from outside noise we were over reception area noise from heliport not as controlled as a neighboring hotel we used previously didn t consider it star some surfaces in room were dusty didn t think it was as clean as it should be breakfast confusing as to what you can and cannot have and poor choice on continental having to walk outside to separate breakfast area not great floor in dining room needs attention looking very shabby and worn hotel overall too dark and rooms cannot be made bright with in room lighting restaurant staff friendly
