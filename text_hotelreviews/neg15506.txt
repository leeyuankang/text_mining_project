the bar eigteen was perfect in location and view of the arena and thames but the staff waiting could not cope with serving lots of people one girl was abrupt and rude when asked to be served to top it off the seats situated near the window areas were reserved which we were not informed of that this could be carried out breakfast was lovely lots of choice but the massive que to get seated and served was not nice which all hotels i have stayed in never had this problem
