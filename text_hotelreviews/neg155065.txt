i thought the hotel was not as pictured the outside was dusty and unkept the plants were dead it most certainly was not star the staff were indifferent and offered a basic level of service i asked for directions and they didnt know so instead of finding out that was the end of the conversation i then asked if he could look on line and he did but it was all rather awkward no smiles no happy to help i actually felt i was in a foreign country with a language barrier there was no mini bar again never had this in a reputable hotel before there was no fridge there was no milk not even dried there were no snacks in the room other than two packets of crisps no biscuits with the tea it was all very value led and certainly not as billed i would not recommend and i would not stay again
