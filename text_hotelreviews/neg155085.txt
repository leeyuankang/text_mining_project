the room was on the ground floor an accessibility room and no potential to change the original room temp was very high and the suggestion to change it was turn it off and wait mins in a boiling hot room i slipped twice on a very slippery tile in the bathroom and one of the ceiling tiles was hanging off the times for the spa make them practically inaccessible for a business traveller really dissapointed
