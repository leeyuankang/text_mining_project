the restaurant staff gave my partner and i the wrong meals but we said it was fine and would eat it after watching us take a few mouth fulls the clueless staff and the poor trainee lad ran back to our tables and whipped the plates out from underneath us and apologised saying we had someone else s meal they then proceeded to walk down a few tables and place the meals in front of another couple to top it off they knew we had eaten parts of the meal and the watched us and brought us clean cutlery very poor restaurant service also i asked for a port to come with my cheese board and after the waiting staff asked me about times what port was it arrived how can a resort have such little product knowledge and poor service skills i didn t even feel it was worth complaining about at the time of checkout as the staff looked down upon us i m presuming down to our age even though we were fully paying polite customers this place has fully put my partner and i off of hotels better customer service and waiting staff at a premier inn
