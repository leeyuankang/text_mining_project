the water in shower in the evening was at best warm when i really wanted a hot shower i discussed this with reception and told them that as i had already had a luke warm shower there was no point in sorting out anything in the evening as didn t want to be disturbed in room at that point however was re assured that in the morning when i would be showering that there would be hot water the morning came i went to have my shower and to my dismay there was again no hot water only luke warm at check out i advised the reception desk what had been relayed to the night team and the lack of hot water in the morning the colleague at reception apologised and advised that they would do something for me on my next visit to the hotel i was still charged the full room rental amount even though the lack of hot water was woeful i would like to ask the owner manager of this hotel whether he would return on service like this
