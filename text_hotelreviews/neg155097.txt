the fact that i was told on the phone that i had to come in to ask to see if they had apartments available and they didnt then i was told to take a leaflet when i got there about the spa treatments and decide for the next day because it was available and wasnt booked up i went back downstairs to the spa after deciding and another man ended up telling me and my friend it was all booked up which made no sense because a man before him told us different the experience was not good this time round as too last few times i have stayed in this hotel ive stayed here many times before and ive been very happy thats the reason why i recomended it to other of my friends that decided to book a room same day as us and experienced the same disappointments as they had to change there room due to health and safety issues which made me look abit stupid because i rated it highly all other times i had been happy but this time i was not happy
