this is a hotel run by people who don t know what they are doing sorry but it was that bad the decor is garish and tacky the room a junior suite overlooked the side of the hotel with a glimpse of the river one way if you overlook a dump of building materials and over a builders merchants the other see pictures the first impression wasn t good why did i have to produce photo id when checking in apparently it is company policy the two huge massage chairs which greeted us outside then list on our floor had scrappy out of order signs on them why have them there the room layout was bizarre we had a junior suite so you enter a large hallway where the wardrobes are then turn a corner to find a huge bed occupying most of the space in the bedroom area to get past this and into the rear lounge area you had to contort yourself past the end of the bed whilst avoiding the eye level hazard of the television which was affixed to the wall we didn t bother to use the lounge as it was at the back of the suite with no windows and just a one hideous brocade sofa and a six seat dining table i think the room was design to be the other way round the lounge should have face the windows and the rear part should have been the bedroom presumably the current operators think that guests will prefer to have a view of the building site from the comfort of their bed whilst giving the occupants of the flats opposite an entertaining or otherwise view through straight on to the bed through the floor to ceiling window the bathrooms was huge the jacuzzi bath was good the shower was a complete joke loads of jets at every angle controlled by one tap which was impossible to regulate it was hilarious absolutely impossible to not completely soak the floor whilst trying to work out how to just take a shower the spa was a joke poky scruffy and crowded
