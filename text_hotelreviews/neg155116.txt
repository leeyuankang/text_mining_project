booked the junior suite and was expecting a separate living dining area as suggested in the photos however recieved a large room with a sofa location is pretty poor they do offer a shuttle service to and from stations however this had a tendancy to run late over the two nights we stayed constant loud musuc being played next door spa facilities mediocre staff not very engaging or friendly requested house keeping after the first night whilst we were out only to return to minimal cleaning no fresh towels bath had not been cleaned shower was cold and the attempt at fancy gadgets such as lighting temperature control via the tv seem to be unescessary and more hassle than it s worth overall not very impressed will be unlikely to return
