this was the least nice room we ve had the bed faced away from the lovely river view the mirror should have been above the desk as it was impracticality positioned and i couldn t see to straighten my hair the lighting is very odd it s an eco hotel which is great but even on our third visit the lights still baffle us the restaurant and bar are lovely to sit in but the food is very processed and the quality isn t great we ve eaten there three times now and each has been very poor the prices are over inflated and then discounted by we eat there because it s convenient and saves getting taxis elsewhere
