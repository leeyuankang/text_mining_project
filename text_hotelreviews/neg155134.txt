the shuttle service mucked us around a bit didn t turn up to pick us up and we had dinner reservations the spa was difficult to access in the morning on sunday because nobody was at the desk and so we couldn t turn things on it also would have been better if the spa was open later even for just an hour or two until just would have made our stay that bit better
