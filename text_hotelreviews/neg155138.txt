we have stayed here numerous times but on this occasion were subjected to fighting swearing and shouting in the corridor outside our door resulting in no sleep and a totally ruined new years eve reception told us to email the manager so i called to get his email address and a very terse woman wouldn t give it to me and told me to send it to reception and they would pass it on needless to say a week later i have heard nothing back very disappointed
