in general don t think the price of the stay is worth it there are nice extras you don t get everywhere else like speakers in the ceiling etc the spa doesn t have a proper pool apart from a cold hydrotherapy pool which if your anything like me and don t want to swim in cold water is of no use what so ever the pictures also make everything look bigger than it actually is
