on arrival i was asked to oay deposit would be taken off a credit debit card to cover any accidents or costs of using the mini bar i think this should be made more clear at time of booking i didn t have an issue with them taking card details as a precaution but the money was actually taken out of my account and i have to wait a few days for them to send the payment back
