although my room had a good sea view i was on the first floor which meant people were looking in so found that i couldn t draw the curtains as much it would ve been better to be on the top floor with that kind of view also when i was checking out i realised that i had been overcharged although this was rectified very quickly i was surprised that this kind of thing could happen at a five star i don t like questioning a bill but i was glad i did as i would ve been paying for somebody else s bill
