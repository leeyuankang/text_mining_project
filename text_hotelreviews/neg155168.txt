as a frequent traveller i have stayed in many and star hotels and would only rate this hotel as a e g no safe in first rooms given although stated on room description soap and shampoo in fixed bottles on wall like a premier inn and no other toiletries in room very low lighting apparently as eco friendly but then had air conditioning that wouldn t turn off and kept us awake all night the staff were just about ok apart from the one gentleman who was trying very hard to find us a suitable room location and walk to clapham junction did not feel safe so we used taxis shuttle bus needed notice would definitely not stay here again
