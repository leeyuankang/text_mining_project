i couldn t turn down the aircon to a temperature lower than it was very uncomfortable and stuffy in the room because of this and the windows could not be opened i did turn off the aircon at the wall switch but despite that it kept turning itself on automatically and although it wasn t pumping out any heat it was buzzing through the night so i had to leave my radio on to drown the sound infuriating otherwise very quiet at the hotel this wouldn t put me off using the hotel again i have to stress
