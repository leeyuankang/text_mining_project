this is definitely not a star product there are too many compromises on quality our carpet was torn and frayed there were only two pillows on a double bed only coat hangers the bathroom has soap dispensers and no amenities the standard of a business travellers hotel but so wrong in a luxury hotel curtains and artwork were cheap and tasteless they promise two restaurants but in practice all meals including breakfast are served next door in a thai restaurant and the vehicle access is like a service alley do not expect this to excite it s just a disappointment and deluded to be described as star
