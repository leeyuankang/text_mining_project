unfortunately there weren t any windows allowing fresh air into the room only a very noisy air conditioner which ordinarily would be able to be adjusted and switched on off from the room but was not working so we had to call reception every time we needed to adjust it it was not possible to sleep with the aircon on as it was a little too noisy we would really have enjoyed some fresh outside air on the night that we thought to try out the jacuzzi the spa and pool facilities were closed just after at night when we asked if we could use the facilities we were refused we re grown adults for pete s sake it s not like we re going to drown or something i didn t quite understand the restriction here and that was a pity wifi connectivity was inconsistent in our room the restaurant across the way was severely short staffed on the sunday morning when we tried to get breakfast that after more than minutes of waiting to be served when we had already said to the manager that we were desperate for a coffee we decided to walk out two other couples had walked out before us complaining of lack of service many of the tables had not been cleared and there was bird excrement on one of our chairs overall not a good experience in the rather expensive banyan restaurant and we did no return there during our three day stay preferring to walk into clapham or battersea square for coffee and breakfast
