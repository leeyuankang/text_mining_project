at the time of booking via booking com i was particularly attracted by rating you have there and hence i was eager to pay a premium given that this was going to be a very special night for me and my wife after a very long and difficult period when i had to be in hospital upon arrival we were greeted professionally and though we had to queue for reception i found the member of staff working well however we were quite disappointed when we went up to the room where we did not find essentials like toothbrushes or toothpaste which would be a norm even in a hotel later on we realised there was only an empty box of tissues we wanted to use internet on tv but the keyboard did not work we reported it to the reception and it took a member of staff over half an hour to come to us and change batteries by which time we did not need the keyboard later it happened that the bondage i have on my neck leaked and we asked for a firs aid kit plasters and cotton pads these were brought to us later no scissors which we asked to bring and they cam another half an hour later and we were asked to return half empty asda plaster pack when we finished this again did not look particularly to me we asked for a large bottle of water paid and were said that you don t serve water in large bottles i appreciate you are trying to do your best for environment and that s what appeals to my wife and me too but we could not quite understand why the duvet cover had holes in it and gowns were polyester with belts not matching on the final note the water temperature in shower was very difficult to regulate it was piping hot and cold and you could not predict how it would change next minute so there was a chance of burn ps this feedback was sent to the hotel management with no response received from them
