the shower was very awkward i ended up scolding myself with hot water and all the staff could say we re we are sorry about that due to running out of the shower we left the door open which triggered the smoke detector and someone called our room it then came to light half of the technical things such as out air con the lights and other things controlled by the tv weren t even working i didn t feel like the staff even cared about anything as they just said oh we will fix it at the mains and never called back to see if the problems were rectified
