there wasn t too much that was not too like about it i know the hotel has only been opened since december so you expect a couple of hick ups the grounds outside have not been finished so the view from our room wasn t as good as i thought it would be there was a light in the bathroom that constantly flickered and the toilet flush made a noise for quite a while unless you kept pressing the button we came back late from concert went to floor no seats left plus couldn t get a cup of latte or coffee i don t drink alcohol i m a soft drinker i did find drinks a little expensive didn t try restaurant but could imagine prices were high
