the only thing which could be difficult in future bookings with a friend is that twin bed rooms do not have accessible bathrooms i don t always travel with my husband so i wouldn t want to share a bed i have a complaint which means i cannot have bedclothes on my lower legs so prefer and need a bed for myself
