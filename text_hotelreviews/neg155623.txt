smallest double room i have ever been in only way to get in bed was to shuffle sideways along the wall totally unacceptable room for two people especially paying for nights in a so called club room the only way to close the bathroom door from inside was to squeeze between the toilet and bath impossible for two people to move around at the same time the room photo shown on my confirmation mail did not resemble the actual room and was totally misleading
