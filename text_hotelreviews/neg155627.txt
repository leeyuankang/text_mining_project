we had booked bed and breakfast but they tried to tell us breakfast wasn t included in the price until i showed them booking confirmation the room wasn t serviced for the entirety of our night stay i discovered the night before we left that a symbol on the wall i hadn t even noticed was there was lit up indicating we didn t want to be disturbed and must have been left on by previous occupant and not switched off by housekeeping before our arrival the second evening i was polite asking for teas coffees and extra towels but i was not impressed the next night when we came in from yet another day s sweaty excursion to discover we were expected to sleep in the same bed linen for the third night running although reception promised to send someone up no one came to the room and no one mentioned that the electric symbol on the wall was indicating we didn t want service no literature was available in the room that you would normally expect to find explaining hotel policies etc the bathroom was tiny
