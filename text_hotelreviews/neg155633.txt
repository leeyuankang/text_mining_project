ensuite bathroom was smallest i have ever seen anywhere when you get out of the shower there is not enough room to dry yourself you need to go into the bedroom this wifi is slow and under provisioned to the point that it is unusable at least on the floor where our room was you need to re log in for each session on your device and it took up to minutes for the login screen to load i showed some connection speed tests on my laptop to the manager on duty to explain the situation i was told many guests complained about it but there was nothing they could do
