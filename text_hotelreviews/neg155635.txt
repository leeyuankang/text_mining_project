there were a lot of staff too many in my opinion particularly at breakfast all staff were neither friendly or unfriendly i had a query about my room rate which i had notified bookings com on the day of booking i tried to explain to the staff on arrival to no avail so had to pay the full price for myself when in fact i think i was charged for two people bookings com assured me that they will refund my the difference once i arrive back in australia when i produce the receipt i have since read in reviews that this is a recurring problem i was in a basement room and could hear the london tube underneath the building not loudly but i could hear it i have stayed in paddington many times before and the price i paid is well over the going rate
