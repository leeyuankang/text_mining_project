oh dear i do understand that those moving a paddington area hotel up market are going to have to struggle with small rooms but room for an active year old with a stiff knee from having to walk long distances through a city traumatised and blocked up by the north kensington fire was a real challenge a small gymnast or a twister expert would have had no trouble sliding past the open bathroom door and squeezing into the small space beyond in order to close it again but i struggled it was probably five of the same small gymnasts who could have just squeezed into the capacity lift but normal people or as i discovered trying to get upstairs one texan with a suitcase is more like it
