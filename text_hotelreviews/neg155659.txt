the continental breakfast buffet was decidedly average we also got food poisoning on our second night not from this hotel but had to spend the next day in our hotel room it was noisy and the curtains didn t block out the daylight also when we asked for room service to bring up some water we had to call three times before someone came up and then the water was the bathroom was also exceptionally small at this hotel
