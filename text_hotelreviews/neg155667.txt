had air conditioning which was needed for london in the summer but the towel heater in the bathroom wouldn t turn off and was producing a lot of heat the only way to keep the room cool was to shut the bathroom door but that made the bathroom uncomfortably hot also the shower was so open you couldnt use the rest of the bathroom toilet sink whilst someone was showering without getting sprayed the mattress was incredibly hard overly firm not what we needed after a transatlantic flight our room was directly below the check in desk and we could hear everything people walking moving bags there was only one very very small elevator people max without bags which was not programmed well we waited minutes to use it as every time it came down to the basement rooms it was full of guests who got in at the ground floor and wanted to go up with our bags we couldn t have managed the stairs we almost missed our train
