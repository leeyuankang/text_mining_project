the rooms were extremely small and dirty the bedsheets were not clean and there was a spider on the bed we ordered room service on occasions and it did not arrive and there was no apology from staff when we called to cancel the order hours later there was a bathroom leak and we had to get our room changed the second room we were put in was smaller all this when i informed the hotel months ago that we were celebrating my mums let alone provide us something complementary they ruined the stay for us with poor service
