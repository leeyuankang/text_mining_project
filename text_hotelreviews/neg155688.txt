i booked a suite hoping to have a good experience and to relax to realize it was an underground room in the basement i felt like being in jail with with little light and vue on the an external metallic stairs i asked to change but then was explained that the hotel is full and i could not even cancel and they explained me that the nights are to be charged to the credit card anyway not to mention that internet was really bad and no mobile phone signal at all really bad experience in all and definitely not a place i will go back to
