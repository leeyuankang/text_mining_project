the first room we got could have bin little bigger more space and with a comfortable chair but we got another the day after when we asked for it very nice of you breakfast was good but the full english breakfast would be nice if included we like one or two fried eggs but pounds person day is too much for that overall we don t have very much too complain over when we return too london we will absolutely return to this hotel
