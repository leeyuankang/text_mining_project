the room was definitely not worth my bed room at home is bigger you couldn t open the bathroom door fully as the room is too small the shower was awkward to stand in due to the uneven ceiling they have still not cancelled the pending transaction form a family members account even though the room was paid in full upon arrival and it was promised this would be sorted out immediately the welcoming wasn t as expected we were told we couldn t check in till fair enough which we were then shunted back out of the hotel almost immediately i didn t appreciate this after travelling hours to come to this property
