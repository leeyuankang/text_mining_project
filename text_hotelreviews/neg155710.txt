the room was tiny and the bathroom as well you would have to be good at tetris in order to position yourself so you can close the bathroom door plus the elevator wasnt working for the whole length of our stay that is days some colleagues of mine had arrived days earlier and the elavator wasnt working then either so we are talking about a full week which meant that we had to use the staircase all the way to the third floor enough times thankfully the hotel stuff offered to carry our bags when we arrived but that wasnt enough excuse for a broken elevator
