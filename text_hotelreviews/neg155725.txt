we booked this hotel just for a night after our flight was delayed and we wanted to try something new to be honest i regretted my choice and it was my worst experience in london when we checked in we were told that the lift was under repair and the best part was that we were checked in on the storey of the hotel i don t recall them compensating us for that inconvenience just imagine going up and down flights of stairs after a long tiring day out the hotel staff brought our luggages to our room and to our horror my friend s luggage handle was broken the staff apologized however he blame my friend s luggage for being heavy which caused the handle to break in the first place if the hotel lift didn t break down this wouldn t happen we told the manager on duty who said he can only offer us complimentary breakfast which we declined the manager said he will bring up the issue to their in charge who will be in the next morning the next morning however the in charge did nothing at all and only told us to email in our complains i was dumbfounded expected some form of service recovery but got none speechless really and the lift wasn t fixed yet that morning made me wonder just because i m not staying in a star hotel doesn t mean i don t deserve service right
