continental breakfast was included in the room price the hotel also had hot breakfast available for extra but the continental breakfast didn t have any eggs available which would have been an improvement my room was upgraded at check in to what they called a suite which had a sofa i suspect the original room would have been small no iron available or bottled water hairdryer lacked power and was difficult to use with arthritic hands
