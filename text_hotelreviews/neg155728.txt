the rooms are very small and the elevator didn t work during our stay days they gave us a room on the third floor but we asked for another room at first they didn t want to give us another room but eventually we had to sleep one night in that room and the other two nights we were moved to another room on the first floor if you are a tall person the beds are way too small last but not least you have to pay extra for english breakfast we chose the continental normal breakfast but there s little choice what you want to eat
