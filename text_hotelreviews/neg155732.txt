room was way too warm even though i was on the ground floor and had turned down the thermostats couldn t open the windows both my partner and i kept stubbing our toes when leaving the bathroom you couldn t see the tv screen when soaking in the tub all you could see was the reflection of the ceiling and last but not least the taps in the bathroom didn t run cold and there was no water in the mini fridge so i could not have a cold glass of water
