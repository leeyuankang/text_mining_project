since we were two of us with days stay we had a lot of luggage with us bags to be precise and it was quite a small room for us to manage with all the bags and move around comfortably inside the room so having the room size slightly bigger in size would help for twin room sharing customers like us with more luggage space otherwise the room was always cleaned every single day and was spic span by the time we return in the evening from our meetings
