breakfast included but they offer you just the continental breakfast very poor and they prepare in another table the english breakfast eggs bacon salad etc but you have to pay for that no sense all peopole just had the continental one with disappointment elevetor they didn t repair the elevetor so you have to do floors of stairs with your luggage they don t offer you help be careful at the rooms under the level of the street they are very noise i don t suggest more for the service than for the structure that could be good
