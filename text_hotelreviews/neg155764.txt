for one room was absolutely too small there was barely any space to walk around the bed and even more so for our suitcases was definitely too cramped also they could not offer us bottled water to the room and told us to drink from the tap or go to the tesco to get one for the money being asked per night you would think this could be offered without a problem also staff seemed a bit off and just annoyed at really anything that was asked from them
