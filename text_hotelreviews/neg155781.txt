the lift is a nightmare one lift serving all floors and used by staff and guests lift very small and slow stayed on the first floor and lift would often stop with people going up despite pressing to go down stairs are quicker and easier to use wifi very slow and found to be quicker room we stayed in was very small despite next door room being much bigger
