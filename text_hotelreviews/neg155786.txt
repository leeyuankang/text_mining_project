the whole experience was extremely poor i had to change rooms twice because they got the room type wrong in the first room then the second room door would not lock and the final room was just very worn down the staff were nonchalant to this fact that was extremely frustrating i was given a run down iron and ironing board that i couldn t use because it was just rotten i went for food in the roba restaurant i think that s the name and it was terrible and the cutlery and serving plates were filthy so i couldn t even eat my food which was all frozen by the way i had garlic bread and fries as a snack but cancelled the main i genuinely wouldn t recommend this place if you intend to feel comfortable or you are used to high quality hotels
