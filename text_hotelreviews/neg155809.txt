two main issues really the room which we had for this visit was much smaller than the room we had the previous year the bathroom was extremely small also there is only one lift which can only hold a maximum or three guests shouldn t be too much of an issue unless like us you are on the fifth floor the stairs from the second floor up get very narrow
