the check in was all a bit rushed we were not informed where breakfast was served and as it is a big hotel it meant a bit of wandering around to find the room we were not given a copy of our hotel bill at the end of the stay and i forgot to ask for it not enough tv channels for a star safety box was quite hot inside as it was located directly above the mini bar so the heat was radiating up into it the light switches next to the bed only on one side governs the whole lights so if the person on the other side wants to get up in the night they have to do so in the dark the view out the window was miserable straight on to an unfinished tower block the design of the breakfast room means some tables have a good view of the river while many others don t as the separators are very high so you can t see around your little area
