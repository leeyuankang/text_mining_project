breakfast was a little disappointing but with so many great places to eat near by this was not a problem for us the sound proofing between the rooms were very good but you could hear everything happening in the hallway we kept wondering if the door was open when people walked by it wasn t luckily it was normally very quiet so it wasn t a major concern small room with no room for suitcases we traveled with one big suitcase and it was possible to open it on the floor but i doubt you could open another one at the same time and still be able to walk from the bed to the bathroom there was a rack for hanging clothes but not really any shelves
