the elevator lift was broken during the two days of our stay there was only one lift in the hotel and we were given a room on the floor which was quite a trek upstairs the room was very small and barely had space to move around for two people let alone have our luggage open the bathrooms too were very small if i was brushing my teeth no one else could come in to the toilets or else i would get hit by the door while the staff were apologetic for the lift not working definitely the value for money was less as i could have been at a hotel where the basic details such as lift was working and i would have had a larger room and toilet for the same price i paid for the room at norfolk
