on arrival we found long black hairs in the bedsheets elevator out of service and room in floor we booked a quiet room and what we got was a room next to the elevator which was very loud and also the room themselves were not sound isolated we even could hear our neighbours talking the breakfast included turned out to be only for continental breakfast and they asked for extra payment if we want english breakfast it was overall very dirty and old for all this it is much too expensive we cannot recommend this hotel
