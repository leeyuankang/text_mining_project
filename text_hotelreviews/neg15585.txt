was not told on booking to my knowledge that there was a a night charge up front for potential extras however it appears you can get away without paying this on the basis you cannot access the minibar and if you have anything you need to pay for in the hotel you have to pay for it up front as opposed to charging it to your room the tv wasn t tuned in properly so had to get a technician to show me how to get it to work the thermostat controls minus and plus touch buttons don t illuminate so i couldn t see how to control the thermostat in the dark at night having forgotten about the plus and minus signs again having to get a technician up to my room for me to realise why i couldn t adjust it beside lamp didn t work as bulb had blown and i didn t see switch for it hanging down the side of the bedside cabinet my rating as added up by booking com of is more like a in reality
