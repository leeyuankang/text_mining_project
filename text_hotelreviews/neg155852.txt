the only negative was that the lift wasn t working so we had to take the stairs but they offered help with luggage and maintenance was taking place immediately to get it up and running again plus my girlfriend doesn t like lifts so we d have probably taken the stairs anyway and it was clearly just a technical fault which happens to everyone so it wasn t really something i d pick to improve about norfolk towers
