requested early check in in advance by email and was surprised it was unavailable and also at a charge of i have stayed in many hotels around the world including london august and have always been facilitated with early check in when requested and never at an extra charge that was very disappointing as i had to change and freshen up after my early am flight in a public toilet as not even a spare room was available for me to use very very disappointing and i will never use this hotel again as a result or recommend it to friends and family
