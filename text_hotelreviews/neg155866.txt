the bedroom was not really a double as far as room area is concerned if there had been two of us i do wonder where a second suitcase would have been stored i did contact reception to check it was a club bedroom as i expected a larger room only one person at a time in the bathroom and the shower screen was not sufficient to stop water spraying onto the floor at the side of the toilet i was very angry when i realised that the lift only went to the fourth floor i should have returned to reception and asked for help to the fifth floor which was up a very steep narrow staircase but had had a long day and simply wanted to get to my room i was angry because i was not informed by reception that the lift was out of order after the fourth floor consequently each time i returned to my room i had to climb the top stairs being in my seventies and a woman i do not understand why the state of the lift was not pointed out to me or even why i was allocated the top floor i always ask for a higher rather than a lower floor but certainly do not expect the lift to be partly out of order before i booked out of the hotel i rang for assistance to carry my suitcase to the next floor down and as it so happens as i opened my bedroom door to put my suitcase in the corridor one of the hotel staff was in the process of carrying other suitcases for the same reason at reception i was given an invoice for my two night stay and it was only when i checked later in the day found that the charge was correct but the address belonged to someone else reception need to up their game as it lets the hotel down
