we initially booked a standard double room and then a week before we were due to stay went online and found a superior king at the hotel for cheaper a lucky find but a bit cheeky of the hotel to try and charge more for a less superior room also service at breakfast was a bit poor as we had to wait minutes for our tea and they didn t give us any milk
