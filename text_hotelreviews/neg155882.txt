attitude of staff was bad and room was uncomfortable we booked a double room and when we arrived we requested the possibility of checking inn early around pm our request was denied but a young white couple was given the room despite the fact that they arrived after us room was freezing no heater after several requests to sort out the issues it was not solved the next morning we requested again to sort out the issue instead they wanted to give us a small room with the heater and give our room to another couple we refused the room on our way to our room we found the couple and they were complaining about the size of their room but the hotel was going to give them our room with good heating when i explain to them that the room has heater problem the lady told me that they were told that the room is big and has good heating the third day the switch the water heater finally we had some sort of comfort but we were surprised why they were not honest and fair and dealing with clients i don t think i will stay at this hotel again with the staff attitude that we had
