room extremely small overall very uncomfortable bed it is not what you see on the advertised photos absolutely horrible breakfast i had the worst breakfast experience staying at a hotel an asian origin lady apparently the boss is running her dictatorship at the restaurant first thing you hear when you walk down to the restaurant for breakfast is what you cannot eat waitresses are super stressed there s an obvious tension on the floor nobody smiles you can t even sit where you want in the restaurant felt like north korea wifi terrible it takes you few mins to connect then it hardly loads anything had to use personal mobile data overall i felt ripped off definitely not value for money avoid staying at norfolk
