cleanliness clearly nobody in this hotel have heard about dusting room size not even close to the picture while booking i know it s london but we had a twin room and it was literally impossible to separate the beds because there were no space to move them the wall was completely packed with cupboards bathroom size if you d like to open the door while inside the bathroom you will have to move as much as possible behind the toilet just to get enough space for door opening and getting out of there ok i may exaggerate a bit but for a bigger person i bet you you ll find it uncomfortable short beds since i m not tall it didn t bother me but in case you re cm or taller pay attention to the length of the bed while booking elevator didn t work several times on our stay and the guy from the staff was supposed to carry the luggage to our room but he noticed us that he will be able to do this only in a half an hour and of course it wasn t meeting our need of getting it now so i had to carry it myself i feel like i can do anything now thank you early check in the price of early check in was ridiculous breakfast comedy club it was incredibly fun and also kind of sad to watch how the breakfast reception lady was guarding the english breakfast buffet you could have purchased them for additional ponds or so if you wanted to if not you weren t allowed even near it continental breakfast didn t propose any salad so i felt really bad when i was forced to steal the salad garnishes from the ham plates sorry i just had no other choice
