i was majorly disappointed with this hotel i arrived and found my room to be really dirty there were stains on the carpet which you can accept in a hotel but what you can t accept is finding two hairs and a pubic hair in the bed and having a throw at the end of the bed which is covered in stains i felt so uncomfortable sleeping in the hotel after this the next morning i stepped into the shower and within seconds it was overflowing water going all over the bathroom floor i had to turn off the shower and was unable to properly shower when i mentioned it to reception they said i had to left the drain up on the floor before i shower to allow the water to pass through i ve never stayed in a hotel in my life where i ve had to fiddle about on the shower floor lifting drains up before i shower and if this is the case provide me with instructions in the bathroom so i know to do this when i told reception i was unhappy with my room and it was unclean they said sorry no offer to reimburse me in any form sorry doesn t really cut it
