do not go to this hotel i was kept awake all night by regular rasping noises like very loud snoring coming form the bathroom i complained in the morning and was told the manager was too busy to see me even though i offered to return after breakfast he clearly did not want to face me i insisted a staff member accompany me to the room where he the handyman verified the noise was still very much happening every few seconds i filled a complaint form and left it for mr touray the manager he has never been in touch even though i e mailed him as well i did not sleep all night and the fact that they did not even say sorry or contact me is disgraceful
