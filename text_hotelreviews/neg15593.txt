for p night the room facilities were a laugh one tiny bottle of body wash between two one milk ration each and no buscuit no menu for room service its on the tv so have to operate the remote first finally when it did arrive it was luke warm unappetising and very expensive four small beers platter of meat awful one soup one cold chips two rock hard bread rolls came to there was no mention of charges for parking on the booking form that was an extra p night in all a very expensive hotel that had all the ambience of an airport lounge and finally don t bother with the postcode for the sat nav we tried it in three of them and it wasn t recognised ended up using my phone which died on me at the hotel for use of a charger so unless you really need to stay there don t you will find a lot better in the city for the same price and get the docklands light over
