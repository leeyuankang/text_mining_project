i was given this room is awful it was a portico on the first floor so it juts out over the street and is all glass windows across one wall that would have been great if it was sound proofed and the huge curtains were organized to open and allow the windows to open to let in some fresh air however this was not the case and the room felt uncomfortably small due to the extra large bed and the foot around the edges the bathroom was a crazy little caged space off to the side if you cannot stand noise or having the street lights beaming directly into your room this is not the room for you from the d cor i assume the other rooms must be appointed quite well so maybe one of these might be great but i felt i was in the worst room on the property and being an international traveler from the southern hemisphere hoping for some sleep this just did not happen staff were nice but incompetent at billing they charged me incorrectly and i had to pay pence on booking out
