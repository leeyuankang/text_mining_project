this hotel was quite a joke the room was ridiculously tiny i had to actually climb over the bed to get to the other side of the room the elevator was so slow and could only hold at a time as if that wasn t annoying enough two days in the elevator broke and we had to walk up and down flights of stairs i actually had a sprained ankle so this was a major problem the elevator was still out of service when we left three days later i found staff quite rude and condensing not just to me but to other guests particularly front reception the hairdryer actually set of the fire alarm one morning just from the stream in the room which brings me to my next point there was no ventilation in the room at all house keeping kept closing out tiny window every day too which didn t help the situation house keeping took my bottle of water and when i phoned reception to inform them of this they were rude and said there was nothing they could do until they spoke to staff the next morning to ask them if this was true i had to take medication and the tap water was not drinkable not sure why as iv had tap water else where in london and it s been fine but this water was disgusting and tasted like sugar breakfast was basic bare minimum of toast croissant cereal no cornflakes and juice honestly the service was terrible and no where near a star
