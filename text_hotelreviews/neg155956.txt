however when we got in the suite the room itself was lovely clean and spacious but the bathroom had a foul human excrement smell when we first arrived we didn t notice it to much as we were in and out it wasn t until we returned on the night plus the smell has crept into the bedroom and it stunk as it was a lower ground room i can only assume all floors above waste was travelling through our bathroom waste pipe we told the staff in the morning and they didn t seem to bothered well put this way not as bothered as swiping my card for payment the smell was horrendous
