room wasn t ready upon arrival within the arranged time frame this ended up with a minute wait at the reception area no staff attended to inform or reassure guests re ongoing situation of fire alarm sounding intermittently in the early hours these were false alarms which i discovered on phoning reception the first alarm caused my daughter who was woken up from a deep sleep considerable distress neither did anyone enquire about our experience or mention it in any way the following day i was expecting to have a chance to bring it up on check out because it had led to a severely disturbed night but i wasn t asked how the stay had been too few staff at breakfast which made it a somewhat chaotic atmosphere being on the floor and nursing an injured leg i had to unfortunately depend on the lift it was functional but very small with very occasional queues to use it
