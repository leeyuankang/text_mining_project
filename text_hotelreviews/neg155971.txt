i did not like the fact that for days friday saturday and sunday the lift was out of service and waited until monday to fix it even i helped some new arrivals to the hotel with their suite cases up the stairs because they were ladies and others old people i did not like the extra charge the hotel demanded even being little because the room price they charge should include the extra food they charge for it in conclusion i will never go back to this hotel even if they charge me half of the price i paid last time
