when i was booking our room we said we didn t want a basement room but on checking in that s what was given when we mentioned it the gentleman said that s what was there we also mentioned when booking the room that we were celebrating our wedding anniversary that day but the hotel took no notice breakfast was included when booking the room but in the morning we were told if we wanted a full english breakfast that we should pay more money for it so we ended up just having a cup of tea and croissant which was disappointing as we were looking forward to it at check out they were not friendly they didn t ask how our stay was
