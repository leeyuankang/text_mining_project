don t go to this hotel the overall impression was that the hotel was more interested in taking your money than taking care of you we had a suite but it was located in the basement no view outside and a very odd smell in the room you couldn t sit on the bar and watch football unless you ordered something even if you were a hotel guest the male bartender threw a man out for that reason even though the bar was practically empty never seen that happening in any other hotel the bar closed early english breakfast was for extra cost and for this price it should be included didn t see too many people eating it
