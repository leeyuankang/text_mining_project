when i booked the room i was under the impression that breakfast was included when i had breakfast however i was charged extra for the eggs meats and mushrooms it seemed petty and stingy that only certain foods were free and yet other more healthy and filling options were sitting out and available but for a price if you re going to play that game it might be better to include some hard boiled eggs on the continental side better yet if you re going to charge for anything it should be made to order
