when i walked in i had no makeup on and the room wasn t ready for which is check in time staff were at the reception and stared as i walked over none made themselves look welcome and they looked me up and down they didn t offer any drinks or show us to the bar they just sat us down in the lobby and ignored us however when i checked out the next day the same woman couldn t have been more friendly this time i had my makeup on i wouldn t recommend staying here unless you were looking for a tiny room to stay one night in anything more would be a nightmare to stay in the box rooms
