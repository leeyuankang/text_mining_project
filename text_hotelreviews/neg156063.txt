the room was small for the price that was paid was told breakfast was full english and that it was included in the price paid bathroom was very small and not much room to move around in location to london wasn t very good as was at least walk to oxford street if booking i would recommend not booking with breakfast included as there is a pub just up from the hotel that does full english for the same price as hotel plus it s extra on top of what you already pay for the hotel itself
