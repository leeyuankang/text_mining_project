considering it was an executive room it was small even by london standards weird layout in the hotel meant wait for ages for the one lift or go past the kitchen to the stairs walked in to the room to be faced by another flight of stairs to the bed thin room low ceiling aircon didn t work so it was hot and a surprisingly small tv other rooms may be better but avoid usual east european and middle eastern staff were polite and helpful and the continental breakfast was ok good croissants
