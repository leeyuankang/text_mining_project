the room wasn t really a room more like a cupboard the door couldn t open properly because the furniture a bed a chair and a desk that had been crammed into the cupboard in a desperate attempt to make it pass as a room took up the entire floor space there was no space for me to put down my bag other than on the chair and that left nowhere for me to sit or stand other than on the bed i felt quite literally like i was a child hiding in a store room meanwhile the hotel staff told me there was no way to change rooms having already paid for my two night stay i felt compelled to make the most out of it but i should have just left i slept reasonably well but slipped into depression the claustrophobia anxiety that i didn t have adequate accommodation when i was supposed to be enjoying myself in town and lack of self worth to be accepting a cupboard as my dwelling added up to an oppressive wall of negative feelings surely only ordinarily experienced by the homeless i bit the bullet and paid for a second hotel after the first night i simply left and never went back my advice to others is to pay a few extra pounds at a hotel where you actually get a room instead of being crammed into a storage space like a pile of unwanted linen
