the two nights we stayed was not so smooth i have to say the slow and broken down once in a while elevation didn t help either but the most annoying thing was we didn t have hot water to take a shower the second night well the first night we have noticed the shower water was luke warm so when i called the front office to let them know the response was they will notify the engineer to our great surprise the second night when we were ready to take a shower there is no hot water at all the answer from the front office was to wait so we waited and waited till midnight and there is still no hot water although when we got up in the morning ready to leave for the airport the hot water is back we choose the rate which includes the continental breakfast yes they have the basic but that s about all in comparsion with most other hotels we have stayed at in europe the rating is poor the hotel is obviousely newly renovated the bed is comfortable we even got an upgraded to a suite but the suite is only slight larger than a small room this doesn t look like a four star hotel to me i would definitely try to book another hotel if i will visit london again for the money we pay this won t be the best choice
