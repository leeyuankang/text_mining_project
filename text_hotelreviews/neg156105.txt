very hit and miss on the rooms we were first allocated a box room i could nearly touch both sides of the room we asked to move however there were no other rooms available they did move us on the second night to a much larger room however my frustration was the lack customer service on the front desk if you get a large room the value for money is great however the smaller rooms are tiny and so you could be left disappointed with the lack of space
