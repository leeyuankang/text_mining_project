in terms of location it was a little further out than we would normally stay but in the grand scheme of things this didn t really make too much difference the hotel is really close to paddington tube make sure to come out of the praed st exit and it s literally a minute walk and this falls on a number of underground lines making it very easy to access all the sights and shopping my only issue was the mattress on the bed which seemed to me quite soft and probably needed replacing it was sunk in the middle through use however i still slept well
