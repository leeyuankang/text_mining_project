what could have been better about this hotel is that the wall should be more sound proof than it is as we could hear people talking despite them not talking too loud in the wee hours of the morning also if it is possible to make the check in hours a little earlier than as we had to wait for the time and we were already flushed out from the long hours of flight and just looking forward to rest
