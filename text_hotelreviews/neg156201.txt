room we initially booked we were moved after complaining was on the floor and basically an attic room very small and noisy appeared to be coming from aircon vent even though it was not on staff need training on what to do when the fire alarm goes off no one took control and told us what was going on and what we needed to do total lack or organisation luckily it was a false alarm on this ocassion also bar was not open while we were there and there were no drinks in the fridges in the room bathroom extremely small and difficult to gain entry with the door opening inwards hotel definitely not designed for the elderly or disabled
