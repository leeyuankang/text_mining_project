we asked for an early check in as we need to change for a reunion i appreciate that it could not be guaranteed but it was very obvious that they were not even going to try to check availability from their attitude at the front desk also asked for a quiet room they put us at the front of the hotel with the traffic and buses don t give people options if you are not going to do anything for them just adds to disappointment
