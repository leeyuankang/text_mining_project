the only problem i had was finding the hotel leaving north greenwich underground station there were not any direction signs i knew it was alongside the it was difficult to find because there is still building work nearby you have to enter the and walk to the rear of to find it so please direction signs are urgently needed for the traveller on foot i do not like walking around in circles
