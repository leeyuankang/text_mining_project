the room stank of marijana advertised as non smoking room extensive building works are currently going on drilling wires hanging out everywhere the staff are pure weird with no interest in guest satisfaction the bathroom was so small that it s physically impossible to sit on the toilet due to the sink drainage piping being where your knee needs to go the staff knew about this and just laughed the plumbing gargles above your head throughout the night breakfast isn t included even though it says so on booking com beware recommend you avoid this place so many other hotels that are far superior
