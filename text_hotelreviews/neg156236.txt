having to be asked if what breakfast we had paid for and that we could not have the cooked selection unless we paid more it was not done in a professional or discreet manner for an extra this could have been done on arrival or included secretly within the room price and the choice is breakfast or not i thought when breakfast was included i did not then have to face a choice so coming down to breakfast felt quite insulting to be challenged at that point
