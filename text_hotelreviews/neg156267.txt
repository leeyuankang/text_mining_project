overall what we got was not what we expected from a four star hotel the hotel is quite old and the rooms are very small there s only one lift that takes ages to reach we sometimes had to use the stairs the lift itself is very small and can barely take persons breakfast however was our greatest disappointment we were offered continental breakfast with the room we took the breakfast area down the basement was quite dim and unwelcoming with dark antique furnishing not the perfect atmosphere for your early morning breakfast the selection of food was very narrow only one kind of cheese and no eggs there was no name tag under each dish we couldn t tell what type of meat was on the tray
