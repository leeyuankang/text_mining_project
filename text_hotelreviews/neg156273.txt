from the start there was no disabled access when i booked the hotel it had disabled access to which i was shocked there was no way i could get into the hotel unless my sister and friend could lift me in my wheelchair what about their safety secondly the lift was a disaster you could fit people in there never mind a wheelchair also in the morning when we took the it to the basement where breakfast was served we realised that the lift had to be recalled by a key instead of us pressing a button but only if a member of staff would be a there if not you had to find a member of staff also when we went down to the basement floor for breakfast we stepped out not realising and we walked straight into a heap of washing barrels not what you expect when you exit a lift we decided that we wear going to complain it was the general manager that we spoke to first about no disabled access as the other points i said that i booked via booking com he said that he would get in touch with yourselves to remove the disabled access the next morning day we left we got the option of full cooked breakfast and the night removed from our bill overall it was this was a dismal affair but peaked by the v nice receptionist who dealt with our refund but no i would not recommend as disabled person staying hear until they get at least a ramp if you are going to advertised it
