i was charged a holding fee for the room days before arrival and then the full amount on check in i queried this with the desk staff and was informed that the would be refunded but could take up to days something i was not aware of prior to my stay and which adversely affected the enjoyment of my trip as my budgeted spending money was greatly reduced also the restaurant was being rennovated and there were no bar facilties again something that i had not been made aware of also i had expected a king size bed in our room but it was a twin room i e mailed the hotel to raise the issues i had mentioned it to desk staff but they were pleasant yet rather dismissive i know they received it because our bed was changed to a kingsize the next day but i haven t received any response to or acknowledgement of the e mail
