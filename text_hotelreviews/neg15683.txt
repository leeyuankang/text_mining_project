over an hour to check in staff excellent but overwhelmed by everyone arriving at the same time nearly hours to get a table in the bar and get some food bar lovely but way way too small not allowed into the much hyped floor bar as two large groups in for birthday celebrations unacceptable for residents to be treated like that
