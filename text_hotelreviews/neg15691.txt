breakfast was the only disappointing part we arrived minutes before the end so naturally had a slight queue to get in but once we were in we were seated quickly the staff were a little disappointing very friendly but no one seemed to be assigned to our table we waited at least ten minutes before we got coffee then had to queue for the breakfast buffet after another minutes of the queue not moving i gave up and decided to order from the menu it was around minutes after arriving that we finally got a menu after quite a long wait and at the close of breakfast we were served our eggs benedict which were really delicious but all in all it wasn t a particularly enjoyable breakfast experience to top it all off we had the misfortune of being seated next to a family who decided it was acceptable to wear their pyjamas to breakfast and let their children run around next to us really quite disappointing from a five star hotel
