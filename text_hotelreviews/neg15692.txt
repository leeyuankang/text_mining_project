the hotel is overpriced customer service was poor as we were charged for taking food from the mini bar when we did not the room key card system broke in the hotel and it took hours of us chasing up various members of staff before we had a key and electricity to the room we did receive a letter of apology from the hotel but we still feel let down by the service
