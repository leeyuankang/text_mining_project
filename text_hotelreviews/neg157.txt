the first night we got there we where put in a room where there was a horrible smell coming from the bathroom i raised this with the staff and was given another room however we where there days and the housekeeping is shocking they do not clean rooms properly but most importantly no clean bed sheets they just come make ur bed that s all same cups same rubbish it s disgusting please note if you are not a couple or prefer privacy do not book this hotel their rooms are designed in such a way they are not practical glass doors n the toilet n shower are clearly visible from the room which was really annoying we had a room where i could see the toilet from the bed other than that it was ok not worth the money we paid
