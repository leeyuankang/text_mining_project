the duvet on the bed was way too thick my husband and i spent all night kicking it off because we were just too warm even with the thermostat turned right down breakfast in the morning was a huge disappointment all the hot food was cool and tasted very much like it had all been sat there for an hour or longer even the beans were cold the fried eggs weren t cooked properly and the fried potatoes tastes awful the croissants and muffins were either stale or not defrosted enough and the smoothies and yoghurts both tasted stale your staff also could not advise if the orange juice had sugar or not unhelpful with my husband being diabetic such a shame as the rest of the stay was incredible
