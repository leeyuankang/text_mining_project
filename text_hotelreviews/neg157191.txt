just a small recommendation if i may the day we left we asked at the reception for a taxi to the airport the fee we payed however was more than for a tipical parisian taxi maybe it is not a big difference but it leaves you with a bitter taste it wasn t a taxi and it didn t have a meter probably the hotel management could consider some other correct taxi service
