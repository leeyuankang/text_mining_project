the room was too small it looks much better in pictures but in reality it s hard to walk there alone but even talking about people our shower door was broken and when i told that on reception i was told to just put a towel on the floor definitely not something that a star hotel should say also once we were going on a walk and wanted to take a cup of tea with us but on that moment there was no hot water the receptionist saw that we were struggling with the hot water machine and she didn t even offer to help in the rooms not always tea coffee and water were renewed
