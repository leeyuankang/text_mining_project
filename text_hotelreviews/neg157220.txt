i asked for a special request to surprises my girlfriend with a cocktail and some fruit for when we arrive and then on check out i got charged euros for a bowl of grapes and a cocktail everywhere else i have stayed they do this complimentary if you make a special request the area around the hotel can be quite scary at night with groups of men hanging around it was intimidating when i went out in the evening with my girlfriend because they would say things to us in french as we walked past and then laugh the area around the hotel is full of sex shops and escorts try to avoid this area and stay closer to the centre of paris near the champs elysees the room service is overpriced and there are not many good places to eat surrounding the hotel
