they said they upgraded our room but it s still very small the room doesn t even have enough space to place two open suitcases the room is only good for one person to stay they didn t clean the carpet there are cookies on it and they forgot to give us towels and water bottles when we call the front desk they were not helpful they ask us to write a memo to their hotel manager or write it online and this is exactly what i m doing right now
