because we were on the top floor our angular shaped roof close to the windows caused a bit of discomfort when trying to open close them the desk and tea station were also positioned in this area so it made eating and preparing tea coffee a bit challenging the wifi could ve been a bit better certain apps like my south african banking app wouldn t connect none of these issues were horrible though and i would still stay in this exact room again
