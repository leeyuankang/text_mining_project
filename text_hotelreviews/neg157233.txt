coffee machine was broken we asked at the reception to check it and they said they would fix it but when we came back to our room in the evening it was still broken we also had an empty box of napkins in the bathroom it was a little inconvenient we got a room for handicap people though none of us are handicap hence we had a very inconvenient shower because it was designed specifically for handicap people moreover the closet didn t close and hence it was hard to get the lights off which were inside the closet the design of closet was very inconvenient because safe was just in the middle of it so we couldn t fit our jackets inside
