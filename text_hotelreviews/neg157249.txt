hotel sign was tiny our cab driver had to call the hotel to find out where exactly the hotel was on the street our room a c wasn t working properly advised the front desk about the issue but nothing was done about it had to open windows to let the cool air in the manager advised us that the whole building s ac system was set to winter mode heating only therefore the room temperature could not be adjusted she then told us to switch the controls off and leave the windows open although the hotel manager at that time was very apologetic and was very informative about the issue the front were quite disappointing that they gave us false hope that it will be fixed
