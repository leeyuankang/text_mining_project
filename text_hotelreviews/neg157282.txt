didn t like the nespresso there were no instructions on how to use it we did eventually figure it out but the coffee was like tarmac not very pleasant needed about coffee whiteners each but there were only left out also no hot water for tea bags very disappointing the breakfast room breakfast was a bit disappointing very limited choice especially for hotel no museli first morning very poor fruit salad and the hot food not great this spoilt what would have been a fantastic stay
