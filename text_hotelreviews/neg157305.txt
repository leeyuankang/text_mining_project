the variation in prices is silly for a standard room we paid an average of euro night we heard another guests bill was euro and the advertised price was euro prices for breakfast room service and drinks were much too high we went elsewhere patisserie in little square at the end of the street turn left from reception is very good standard room is quite crowded so you may prefer a larger size but small is typical for paris some noise issues with other guests
