it did not have good soundproof walls for sure for a star hotel too much noise first night i could hear people having sex at night then next day fire alarm was on so loud the last night there was a party going on what staffs refer to as opening of hotel celebration in the lobby had an early plane to catch the next day but it was loud until midnight shouldn t the staffs have noticed the guests about this event althought the facilities were nice it was quite loud overall during our stay
