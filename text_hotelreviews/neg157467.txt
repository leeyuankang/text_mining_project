the wifi does not work our devices couldn t even find a network at first and after we complained one device out of connected but the signal was barely there this was a bit annoying in the tv was not working we had to struggle and dig around behind it to plug it in no big deal but not pleasant either the area is central and well connected but it s not the best neighborhood it s fine we didn t feel unsafe but if you re not used to big cities it can be disconcerting
