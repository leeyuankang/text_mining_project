on booking com they say you can not reserve parking but when we arrived we were told that we should have reserved and there is not enoughe room for our car one of the main reasons for booking this hotel was the parking the reception blames booking com and say they can not change it we also booked brunch on new years day but we walked out before we had anything to eat the restaurant cafetaria is below standard for a hotel the food looked like it came straight out of a bag and we did not get what we orderd
