the area isn t family friendly at night while there is plenty of hustle and bustle there are many beggars and stripper massage sex shops in the vicinity around the hotel this is probably due to its location very close to the moulin rouge if you are visiting paris for the first time the blue line metro that this hotel is closest to is quite inconvenient i d say you d want to be closer to the orange or purple line for most of the main tourist attractions that said we are talking minutes of metro travel inconvenience not hours free wifi is not very good
