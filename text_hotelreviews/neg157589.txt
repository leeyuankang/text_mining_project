there are not much options for food after hours so we opted for the room service we asked the front desk if a particular item had meat in it as we are vegetarian he said there was not when i bit into it there was pork the next morning we explained what happened to the front desk we were told that she had to tell management about the situation and they would contact us we were never contacted this was very disappointing especially since this little jar of food cost euros
