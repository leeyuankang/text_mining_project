i requested a quiet room yet was placed on the first floor facing the main road at am on the sunday morning the guests next door to me made a lot of noise banging their luggage against my door as they left both of our rooms were contained within a tiny hall behind another door for them to get out of the second door they obviously had no room and disturbing me was pretty inevitable even though i was told the rooms were sound proof at i was then again awoken as the maid was cleaning the vacated rom and banging her vacuum against the walls as she cleaned i actually ended up asking her to stop as a genius perk i requested a late checkout the hotel told me this couldn t be confirmed until the day of checkout so i couldn t plan around that at all after being so rudely awoken by my neighbours and then the maid i called reception to ask for my genius perk of an extended checkout the time i had requested that perk i was told i could have hour extra i thought that was an insult after the events of that morning and certainly wouldn t consider hour a genius perk its not that i wouldnt stay there again but i felt pretty disappointed in their service and that booking com tell me i m a valued genius member yet i see absolutely no benefit at all
