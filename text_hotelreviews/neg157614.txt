pictures are misleading as it indicates rooms with a view to the eiffel which none have even though received approval for early check in at i was not given a room until pm and that is after requesting a late check out which they denied and after having left and returned at as they indicated that would be the time the room would be ready a day wasted waiting on lame excuses wait there were none given just that i had no room duh as a genius member i was promised a glass of champagne at our arrival we didn t even get offered a glass of water c est la vie we were never advised of any of the amenities of the hotel nor that the bottles of water in your room were complimentary we had to find out the next day as they were greeting new arrivals while we were waiting for our shuttle pick up tres dissapointed
