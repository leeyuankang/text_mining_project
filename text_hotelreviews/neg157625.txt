maid should clean at appropriate hours rather than leaving till end of the day when we would return also when we did return she was mid cleaning so she left most of the room uncleaned day stay and only half cleaned the room once the rooms are also very close together so in the night you could hear people comming and leaving as the doors are big and heavy
