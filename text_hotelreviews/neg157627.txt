we had a trouble with our ticket and could not get to paris on schedule we informed staff of this the first guy we spoke to told me he would speak to manager to accommodate us he seemed willing to do so then at check out the guy on duty refused to honor this not what we expected at all we had been travelling for the previous weeks and all the hotels we stayed in were customer service oriented and we were determined to return so big surprise in paris
