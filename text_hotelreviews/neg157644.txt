the room i was staying in was next to the stair cases so the sound of people stomping down the stairs was a bit disturbing but isn t enough reason not to recommend this hotel to anyone the air conditioning was set manually to shut off at a certain time during the night time because of the expected cold winter period unfortunately it wasn t as cold as predicted so during the night it got a bit warm
