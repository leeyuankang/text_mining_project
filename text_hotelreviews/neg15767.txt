unfortunately i had an uncomfortable sleep the bed is new and soo hard which was made worse by very soft pillows i tried to phone reception to ask for a different one but no one was available about we asked at reception at the time of booking in to book a table for the sky bar after our concert but she said we needed to do this from our room by the time we did this less than an hr later we were told they were fully booked when we arrived at the bar around the parties before us hadn t booked but were given a table and then when it came to is we had to go to the bar on complaining very politely the staff did everything they could to ensure we had the next table whilst this didn t spoil our stay and i can t thank the lovely ma tre d enough for sorting it out i feel it could have been better organized ie a better booking system in place my only other slight disappointment is that at reception at booking in the lady made out that we couldn t use our debit card to open a tab for mini bar etc as a result we agreed to pay as we went along it meant we had no access to the mini bar which she didn t explain and it also meant that as the milk was in the fridge we didn t have it for coffee in the morning we did ring concierge who said they d arrange to send it up but mins later it still hadn t arrived so we went for breakfast there was also no information in the room about checking out where and when breakfast was and other things like that i presume that perhaps it was just missing from our room as it seems crazy that there wouldn t be one this information also wasn t given to us at checking in my only real criticism would be breakfast the hot buffett was rather dissapointing whilst my companion enjoyed it i found it was mediocre at best however its important to note that there was a reasonable continental selection and i certainly didn t go hungry
