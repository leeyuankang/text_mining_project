windowless room was a disappointment it wouldn t have been asuch of a problem if it otherwise resembled the pictures of the standard double rooms but it was tiny and i could hear all of the noises from the coffee shop upstairs including water running through pipes there was an odd locked door in my room as well that had light coming from all sides through the night not the worst place to sleep but not a place where you could rest and hang out
