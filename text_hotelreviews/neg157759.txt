the hotel itself you had to enter through a cafe that was unclearly marked in an extremely unwelcoming unattractive area which was also opposite a building site the staff were blunt and too busy serving coffee or looking busy than checking us in the breakfast was an abomination serving cheap value cereal bars a few sad hard boiled eggs left on a plate cold and some stale brioche i would t even call it continental just appalling and not worth the money in the slightest i could have bought the whole of the cheap tesco selection myself the room itself was topped it off by the broken sink and tiles surrounding the basin dirty scuffed shower plate and the sink did not drain properly the walk too the zoo was around minutes and the connections a pain for the main tube stations the money for the compact rooms shoddy street and disgusting breakfast is not one i will ever choose to do again
