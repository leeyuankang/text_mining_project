we visited for a weekend break we checked in to the room which was very small and noisy and headed out for something to eat and drink when we arrived back to the hotel albeit early hours of saturday morning the hotel was locked and in darkness we had no option but to knock continuously on the window until someone came to let us in very unprofessional we were told breakfast was included when we arrived to breakfast there was croissant a few slices of packaged ham and some cheese there were some stale biscuits and half a jar of apple juice we were told we could upgrade to a full english for additional expense needless to say we left and went elsewhere shocking service by staff who didn t seem to care i will never revisit
