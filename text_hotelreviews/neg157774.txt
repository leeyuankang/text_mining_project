the room was very small and not suitable for more than one person the bed was smaller than an average double and the air con didn t work although we had a window if you opened it the curtain would move meaning you re flashing the double decker bus outside that s aside from the building works across the road and general road noise it s like everything in the room had shrunk the cleaner would speak loudly on her mobile while cleaning the hall and other rooms without care for other guests the hall had no lighting we had to use our phones for light reception was a desk in the coffee shop downstairs this was where we also found out our breakfast was served breakfast was interesting warm sliced cheese warm yoghurts and fruit curly bread and if you want a pastry you better get there early overall this is one of the worst hotels i have stayed in and wouldn t recommend to anyone
