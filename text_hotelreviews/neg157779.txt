we arrived at the hotel at about the receptionist told us that the check was starting at the room was ready but because we were hour in advance she asked to pay extra pounds that was the hotel policy we didn t accept so we came back after dinner the hotel room was small dirty and especially very cold we were there in december so the heating was supposed to work unfortunately it was not working at this point we asked the receptionist who was very kind and helpful to check and see what was the problem we checked other rooms but all with the same problem it was too cold to stay and we had to live our jackets on all the time at around after minutes we were trying to solve the problem the night porter came and suggested us to stay there night and the next day they would have repaired the heating system in the meantime other people came down to the reception to complain about the same problem at the end after hours we asked to change the other to another with the heating working at that point they gave us anther hotel of the same chain the best western maida vale end of the story this is not a hotel it s a dirty place with no heating small and located in a bad place if you don t want to waist your money don t go there unfortunately i booked the hotel without looking at the reviews otherwise i certainly wouldn t have booked it
