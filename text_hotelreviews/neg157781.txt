staff issue at check in i was told i hadn t paid even though i showed an email confirming i had paid receptionist stated it did not matter what my email said and that i had to pay in full or else she would not check us in was further told issue was with booking com and i should take it up with them which i did issue was resolved however as their reception is on the counter of a cafe it was quite embarrassing as receptionist kept saying there was insufficient funds in my acc was not a happy camper also was the poorest continental breakfast i have ever come across
