breakfast was very poor if u like boiled eggs salami cheese peppers with bread toast or mini chocolate chip muffins then you will be fine i don t mind a continental breakfast but a croissant or pain au chocolate would have been nice i know traffic noise can t always be helped especially in london but the constant police sirens and the sound of the pedestrian crossing all night really didn t aid a good nights sleep
