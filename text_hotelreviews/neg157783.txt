this hotel is located in a very unpleasant area as a young couple we felt really unsafe in this area due to the amount of people fighting on the streets and police vans just outside the hotel staff representatives smoking outside the front door after travelling from newcastle checking in our bags then being told to come back and check in my partner and i received a phone call telling us our room had been cancelled due to overbooking on their end and we did not have a room to stay at for the nights we were in london as year olds miles away from home this had me very distressed and upset and i had to get my parents to call to get our room back the customer service from the reception team was appalling unprofessional attitude and very un friendly they could not have been bothered if they tried no manager to speak to on site either very disorganised bed sheets and walls had marks on them and the bed was tiny we were offered complimentary breakfast for the inconvenience they had caused this itself was very dissatisfactory small selection of pastries cereal and some ham and cheese safe to say i will never be returning or recommending this hotel to anyone worst stay i have ever had highly disappointed i have wasted my money on this
