heating not working only cold air coming out the vent absence of a proper customer support extreme staff turnover some tried to be friendly some extremely rude manager never reachable and not reliable only lots of lies and excuses had to change rooms in nights never a nice stay really a pity as if well kept the hotel would be ok and in a nice place change of manager might help
