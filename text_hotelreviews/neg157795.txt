the rooms were ridiculously tiny the dressing table was damaged so kept catching leg as you tried to squeeze past the tiniest gap between that and the bed the entrance is via a coffee shop type set up so not pleasant when we first got there they gave us a basement room well box with no windows is that even legal surely this is a fire and safety hazard i was so claustrophobic and me and my fianc e had to constantly bump into eachother just to move about both our feet hung out the bottom of the bed i have stayed in many hotels and this by far is the worst i have ever been to rip off and the staff are unhelpful and rude while we tried to check out and tell them of our awful experience she took a phone call and took so long we walked out my personal info and licence were left on the reception for everyone to see so i took these with me horrendous hotel
