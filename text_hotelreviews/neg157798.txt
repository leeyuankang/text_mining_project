air conditioning simply did not work the room was far too warm and as the hotel is situated on a very busy road opening the window was not an option complained to staff on various occasions about the air con as we couldn t sleep for the heat to their credit they tried their best resetting the system etc all to no avail however we had it set to degrees and running constantly with a functioning air con in this tiny room mins at degrees would have been too cold we consider ourselves fortunate to have stayed here in october as it would be unbearable in summer
