the room had no window and i did not know this while booking the pictures look ok but the hotel is a hole i didn t eat breakfast it looked not appealing at all the stuff could not find my name twice at the check in and also when a friend dropped by to pick me up i don t recommend this hotel at all there are better ones for the same price
