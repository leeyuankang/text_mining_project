the receptionist didn t know what floor my room was on when i found my room in the basement someone else was in my room they had gotten their room number wrong and their key had opened my door they said they had also gotten into another room accidentally on the floor when they also were sent to the wrong room clearly there is a lack of security in this establishment and poor staff the room itself was cold and small
