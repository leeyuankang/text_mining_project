the room had no curtains and when reported they were aware of it but hadn t sorted it many complaints and requests to speak to the manager were met with being told to please be patient i had to make some curtains out of a towel bed throw and coat hangers a night for a room that makes harry potters cupboard under the stairs look palatial and to bring your own curtains value for money i think not i was informed the manager would contact my by saturday afternoon days later i m still waiting some of the staff were rude and almost put out by my complaint a shrug of the shoulders and a sorry is not an acceptable way to treat paying guests this hotel has the potential to be a good one a shake up of staff and some lessons in hospitality and the rooms having the basics should help with that do not be swayed by the photographs photoshop has be put to good use here
