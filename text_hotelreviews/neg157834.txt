the girl was on the phone arguing with god knows who about some luggage which was not put in the correct room as the guest felt unwell and she didnt write her handover correctly infact i could tell you everything about that event some things should be spoken about in private left us waiting for ages till we could check in she kept telling the person on the phone she has guests waiting to check in but they took no notice very very very poor staff levels at this property check in was terrible
