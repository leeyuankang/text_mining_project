hotel was advertised to include breakfast when we arrived we were told that it was a continental breakfast and would have to pay for a full english breakfast when visiting the capital of england i would expect a full english breakfast i was then told that due to short staffing the english breakfast would not be available on our first morning there the continental breakfast that was provided was of very poor quality the bread was stale there was no selection of cheese or meat only one type of cheese and meat this was curled and dry i ate breakfast out of the hotel on both mornings
