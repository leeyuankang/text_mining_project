the reason we booked the intercontinental is the spa facilities and the fact it has a tunnel linked to the arena both of these facilities were not available during my stay they were closed due to maintenance by the time i was informed of both closures it was far too late to change hotels or cancel my booking and it was a real let down considering the price paid for the hotel i d recommend to leave booking for a few months whilst the hotel maintenance is being finalised
