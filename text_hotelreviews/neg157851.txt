i messaged the hotel informing them it was my birthday and our engagement celebration the room we got was literally the smallest room i have ever seen we had to sleep with the window wide open as the aircon did not work and it was like sleeping in the dessert we didn t sleep a wink as it was such a busy street the bed was very short so my fianc s feet were hanging off the end of the bed he is only i had to request an iron as there wasn t one in the room and i had to sit on the bed as there wasn t enough to room for the iron and me to stand i saw the cleaner in another room which was twice the size so in sure there are bigger rooms we seem to have been given the smallest breakfast was horriffic it consisted of cheese boiled eggs cut in half a plate of bread which when i asked to have toasted it was warm and soft so seemed to have been microwaved lol and considering the reception is in a coffee shop it was the worst cup of filter coffee i have ever had
