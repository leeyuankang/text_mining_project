extremely hot in room with no window had to leave the key card in the slot to keep the air con working or it became unbearably hot to the point where i had to take a cold shower in the middle of the night i was woken up by a staff member coming into my room at midnight as i lay sleeping naked due to heat i was not impressed all sorts of noise kept me awake from there on in a water heater noise kept recurring for the best part of the night after finally falling asleep after a very disrupted night i was horrified to be woken up by drilling on the other side of my wall at with no warning or mention of the disturbance i was beside myself with frustration i stayed for two nights over the weekend and thought that maybe the sunday morning would be a little quieter and time for some rest after going out late on saturday night wrong once again hammering and drilling first thing sunday morning i couldn t wait to get back home to devon for some rest i will never stay at this hotel again and i advise you to be very cautious when considering this hotel
