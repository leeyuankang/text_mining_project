lots of things went wrong i did not like how the toilet roll bracket came off the wall i did not like how the shower fitting was unstable and at a diagonal angle i did not like how the curtain rail fell of the wall when the curtain was drawn back the bedside cabinet came apart when i moved it slightly to get my phone charger but above all these points the air conditioning wasn t working so it was incredibly hot during the night and with paddington police station opposite made for an impossible night s sleep
