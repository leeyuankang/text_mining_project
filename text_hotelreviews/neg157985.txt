the place is very loud from the restaurant where sound seems to amplify to the rooms where my wall was shaking every time my neighbor closed the door it made it very hard to sleep longer than when the hotel starts to wake up the single room is also very small basically it suffers from the same issues as most london hotels in older buildings small and very noisy
