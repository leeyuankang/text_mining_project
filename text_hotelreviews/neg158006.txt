the only thing i didn t like about this hotel was the size of our family room it was expensive but we d decided to treat ourselves for our daughter s birthday unfortunately it was just a bit tight for the four of us we had two double beds and not much space for anything else the bathroom was a tiny closet in the corner i didn t bother with a shower as it was just too claustrophobic for me
