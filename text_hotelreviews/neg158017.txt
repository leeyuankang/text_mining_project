it was our second stay at georgian house and it has been kind of a disappointing experience for a series of reasons at our arrival the heating in our room was off and not working at the beginning of february the room was obviously cold and the only tool available to heat it was an electric heater no possibility to move to another room not exactly the kind of welcome you wish to receive luckily the heating was fixed the day after there are many fancy beauty products in the bathroom but no bottle of water nor glasses when we asked the receptionist if she could bring us some water she said that she could not come upstairs we specified that we were already in bed wearing our pajama and our room was on the floor but she maintained that if we wanted water we would have to go down six floors to the reception not the answer you expect when you find yourself in a cold room without heating after a long trip at arrival the receptionist asked us to pay the whole amount of the stay we specified that we needed an invoice for the first night only and she said that it was not a problem suggesting us to ask for the invoice at check out on the day of check out other receptionists told us that it was not possible to have an invoice for the first night only since we paid the whole amount in one time we were really surprised because at arrival we had been very clear about what we needed however after some discussions we obtained our invoice even if the d co in the public space is very nice and the house is furnished in good taste managers should take better care of the hotel there are some holes in the sofa cover located the hall and the armchair in our room had some spots and a broken foot
