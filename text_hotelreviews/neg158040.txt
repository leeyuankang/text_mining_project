the bathroom was very tiny the shower was great but the bathroom had no room at all to move around in and felt very claustrophobic the room was well equipped and had a great tv although the tv was on the side wall rather than opposite wall to the bed which made it difficult to watch while in bed to us it would have been much more convenient and made more sense if the tv was opposite the bed
