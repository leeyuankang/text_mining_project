the en suite bathroom was well decorated but the door was constructed with lattice type doors they did not have any frosted or opaque glazing therefore the occupant of the shower room was fully visible from the bedroom ok for some people but not acceptable for anyone who doesn t want to see someone sitting on the toilet
