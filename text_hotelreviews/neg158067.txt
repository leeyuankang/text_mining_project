bed was so uncomfortable and loud we both had sore backs after staying here and sought out a massage place nearby every time one of us moved on the bed the frame would make a loud noise and wake us both up there was also no lift so walking up and down the stairs especially down the stairs with luggage on the final day was annoying wifi was slow in ghe room
