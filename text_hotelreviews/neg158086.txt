as a solo female traveller i did not feel safe at the georgian house hotel when i booked i wasn t aware that they have multiple properties on check in i was informed by the very friendly reception desk that my room was located in building number and that someone also a really nice guy would show me to my room what i didn t realise was that building number was a couple of streets away from the main house there was a tablet with skype set up in each room so that you could contact reception however the table in my room wasn t working the guy said he would call me and that would activate it the tablet never activated so i had no way of contacting reception wifi also wasn t working in the room you used your room key to get in the front door that was the only security the room was fine in general it was functional and suitable for the overnight stop while on business however the nearest restaurant shop was about minutes walk away the next morning i had to walk around to the main house for breakfast walk back around to the building i was in to get my bags and then back to the main house again to check out not ideal when tight on time perhaps i was more aware of security and safety because i was a solo female traveller but i did feel i should have it made aware before booking and that there should have been a phone in the room since the guy mention the skype was temperamental
