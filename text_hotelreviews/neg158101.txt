the bed was the most uncomfortable thing we d ever slept in and we were opposite a construction site so was woken up very early every morning most staff members were very polite and helpful however there was one who was insanely rude and disrespectful to my partner due to his visible tattoos on his arm we asked for a recommendation to a nice restaurant before our trip to the theatre and after recommending a fantastic italian she eyeballed him top to bottom and said how the restaurant was a very posh and she recommended that nandos was around the corner whilst this could be misconstrued as funny i thought it was extremely rude and unprofessional
