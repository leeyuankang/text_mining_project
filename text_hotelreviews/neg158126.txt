bed and room were small if my husband had been with me we d have struggled to both fit but i guess this is what you get in london the main issue was the noise i d asked for a room not too far from reception because of a mobility issues and even though there s no bar a bunch of drunk guests arrived back late and sat sitting at each other in the lounge area for ages i could hear neighbouring rooms toilets and showers and staff and guests started going past the room from definitely don t ask to stay somewhere accessible if you d also like sleep
