it s an old building and a walk up with no lift so being on or floor can be a hike for some first room was very small on top floor and had a slope so we bumped our head a few times as it was the only area to put our luggage they worked to find us another room comfortable but drafty window heat worked so not a huge problem low water pressure in showers
