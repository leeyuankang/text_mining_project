we paid for cooked breakfast but was not informed until arrival that it would be breakfast in a bag in our rooms because the restaurant was closed maybe this was lack of communication with the hotel and this website the breakfast was nice croissant fruit juice and fruit came in a bag for life if we had known we perhaps wouldn t have paid for breakfast and would have eaten out
