some of the staff was confused first he was not able to read our names second he gave us a wrong room upgrade which he changed just after we started unpacking the worse thing was we got the second room at pm one hour after the regular check in time then we were asked to pay the city tax even if it was paid through your site however at check out they reimbursed us the amount of tax we paid extra too many mistakes for a few days stay
