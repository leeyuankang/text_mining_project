heating in the room was far too hot and wouldn t turn down so we had to open the window one of the blinds in the bathroom was missing neither would have been much of a problem except renovation work was underway and we had scaffolding outside our room this meant with the window open we were disturbed by noise from the workmen in the morning and my girlfriend had to shower at select times when the workmen couldn t see into the bathroom
