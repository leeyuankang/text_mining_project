the breakfast was not included in our stay and was not offered after booking we chose an a la carte breakfast of just poached eggs bacon one slice and toast one slice we were then informed it would be cheaper to go for the full english breakfast even though there was nothing else we wanted seemed a huge amount to pay as this was all we ate probably our most expensive breakfast in terms of what we ate the waiter then got our breakfast from the buffet minutes after ordering it the poached eggs tasted of vinegar and there was too much soft fat on the bacon some of the waiting staff spoke little english upon leaving we paid for all our sundries and were then expected to pay parking when i booked a few months ago parking was included in the cost of the hotel and was told that the terms had later changed this had to be waived
