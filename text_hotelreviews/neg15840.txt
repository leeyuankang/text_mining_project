it was advertised as having a covered walkway directly into the arena unfortunately on arrival i discovered it was still under construction this was the main reason i chose this hotel as a solo traveller there was a good selection of coffee but no ordinary breakfast tea only green tea fruit tea i like a good ordinary cuppa had to buy teabags at local tesco having said all this i cannot fault the hotel it was excellent good location very clean i think the covered walkway will be an added bonus when completed i will definitely stay here again
