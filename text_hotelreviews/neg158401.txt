the cooked breakfast was a little disappointing as poached eggs arrived with a lot of water on the plate plus the tomato was very undercooked it was almost raw and overall not very hot i asked for one egg got two also asked for two bits of toast got a rack do not like wasting food the staff should be more attentive when taking an order
