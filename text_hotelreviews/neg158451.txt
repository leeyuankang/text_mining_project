the decor of the corridor and room was not to our taste and appeared a little tired it was probably right up to date at one time but unfortunately it wasn t timeless like the foyer the bathroom was compact to say the least probably the smallest en suite hotel bathroom i ve come across and although i never thought it would be possible the shower is too powerful so you have to modulate the flow with the taps the hot water is far too hot but thankfully they have mixer taps on the basin also the bathroom decor was looking a bit tired like the room there was a wedding on the night we stayed and the music could be heard in our room on the floor this could obviously be an issue for some people the door staff weren t very observant and seemed obsolete but maybe they are just there for the posher looking guests as a treat for my wife s birthday i was hoping for something a little more special than a premier inn which is our usual choice but unfortunately the chesterfield didn t live up to expectations or the price tag then again it was mayfair location location etc perhaps the hotel s other facilities bring the standard up
