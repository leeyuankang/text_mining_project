i had booked a queen size single room as i was travelling alone but found it much smaller than i thought it would be the space between two pieces of furniture was so tight in parts of the room i kept banging my thigh on the corner of the unit as i tried to get in and out next time i ll book a double room in the hopes there ll be more space
