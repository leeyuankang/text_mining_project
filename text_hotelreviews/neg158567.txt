our only slight disappointment with our stay is that we are not used to cleaning staff picking up our personal belongings and putting them away think toothbrush which was drying in its case on the counter taken out of its case and put in glass travel pillow moved etc perhaps this would not bother other travelers but we did not like it we asked to have no service to the room but housekeeping told us that was not an option so if something like this would bother you be sure to put your belongings away before leaving the room
