at the time of our visit the linking tunnel to the itself was closed so we had to track around the outside in cold and wet to concert getting back to the hotel you then stop caught up in all the crowds and it took ages to return the pool was also not open so the review is based on a hotel that promised so much but was let down by the non opening of facilities advertised as open that would have made the stay perfect
