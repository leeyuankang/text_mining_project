we attempted to go up to the hotels bar late into the evening we were stopped by the bar manager and told the bar was full in an act of defiance i explained that at these prices i expected to have access to the hotels bar my friend and i entered anyway to find a bar so unbusy i wondered what the bar managers benchmark was for full we were served immediately and found seats not great service for a a night hotel
