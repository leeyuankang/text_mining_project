we were made to feel unwelcome and out of place i felt embarrassed and angry as i was with my mum i don t appreciate that behaviour my mum is disabled and we had to park in the event parking area as the hotel parking was reserved for the bmw event staff couldn t tell us how to get from the car park to the hotel and we ended up walking for a long time with bags where i struggled let alone my mum i mentioned that we were going to be late to the nitro circus event as it is a fair walk around and was there a quicker way but was just told that no my disabled mum and i would have to walk all the way back around no empathy or care given there was no milk to have tea in the room and so phoned reception they said they would be up shortly with milk but never turned up
