the staff were not communicating with each other the check in was delayed for over an hour and we were given conflicting information about the issue they were having with our booking i was promised compensation and so far have only received some of what they intimated poor service and contradictory information means that i am unlikely to use this hotel again which is a shame as it is rather lovely
