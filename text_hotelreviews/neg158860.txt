breakfast was continental no cooked option and this wasn t completely clear to me on booking the big space downstairs is used for breakfast the cafe a meeting spot for business people and it seems is the working area and check in desk for the staff it gets a bit hard to find a table where you aren t sharing a meeting the bathroom while large enough has a small basin for shaving and bathroom activities with no space for putting anything the water was hot very nice
