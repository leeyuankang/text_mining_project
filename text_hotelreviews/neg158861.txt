for breakfast i had coffee on the first two days espresso and cafe latte i do not know why but it was lukewarm on both days the machine needed warming up time as on both days i was the first customer to ask for coffee i opted for tea afterwards people seemed to be enjoying their coffee so it was probably just accidental or maybe i like coffee very hot which might be wrong preference
