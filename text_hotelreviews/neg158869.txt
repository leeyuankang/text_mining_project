im disappointed with the rooms following the refurb i always loved this hotel because of its quirkiness and cool unique rooms now quite frankly you could be in any hilton or novotel in london all boring cream colour and furniture looks a bit cheap when i asked it was apparently to create a feeling of calm i d say it was really just dull in a superior room i also expect a large double bed with a partner of foot small double beds are hopeless for us so i always book a superior room for that reason but i still like the hotel ill just make sure i get a large bed next time and hopefully they ll keep some of the old rooms
