my room view wasn t great but i was only on the floor i would imagine the higher the nicer view we used this hotel as it said it was located right next to the arena yes it was but it was a long walk to the entrance and reception from the some signs would have been helpful too more info in room would also have been helpful like room service info and what time food is served etc where the dining room was located etc
