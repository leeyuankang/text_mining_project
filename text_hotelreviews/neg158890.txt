it would have loved to be informed about the reconstruction work in this hotel before i booked due to modernization work are large parts of the lobby not in use and the entire lobby has now a hostel like appearance it is not the service but the flair which is missing and for which you book this hotel although the bar is working there is limited service but i am sure that it will be a fabulous place to stay when they finished construction works
