the room was not but very very tiny bed was far too narrow for two cm the room was equipped for one person toiletries etc there was no minibar and no safety box as promised in hotel description one of main reasons to choose this hotel was the raw food and superfood restaurant tanya s caf which was told to be an integral part of this hotel disappointment was big because the restaurant was closed and nobody had informed about this definitely not four star hotel it didn t help that the staff was very friendly and we got free breakfast you should trust that you will get what you have ordered
