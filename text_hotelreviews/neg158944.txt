the bathrooms need exhaust fans the thermostat for the heating air conditioning wasn t working but they said they wouldn t do anything about it because it was part of the central system fortunately the weather was mild so it didn t bother us too much but it will be an issue when the weather gets colder the breakfast was very disappointing they told us they had no bread because they couldn t be bothered getting it from another part of the hotel eventually they got some but they also said the toaster wasn t working the hotel manager did cancel the charge which was appreciated
