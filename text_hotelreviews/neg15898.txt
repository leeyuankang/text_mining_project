we had a member of staff come into our room whilst we were in the middle of getting dressed he opened the door without knocking and got an eyeful of my partner in her underwear we told member of staff in the lobby about the incident and she was very shocked to hear this had happened and a gesture of good will she reserved us a table in the sky lounge for after the event at the and it was the best table in there looking over the centre of canary wharf the complimented us with a couple of free drinks to soften what happened and in all fairness they really went out of there way to make us feel better about the incident which we both agreed did help and worked all of this aside if i were to go to another event in the i will more than likely stay again
