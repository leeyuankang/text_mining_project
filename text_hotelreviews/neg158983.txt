the first room offered had a lot of black mould in the shower we called reception who came to look said it was ok we objected and after a long wait we were moved to a new room the shower was better but still had black mould just not as much as the first the bedside lamps did not work only one coffee bag and one milk for two guests was strange we wouldn t stay here again
