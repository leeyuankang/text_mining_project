i was disappointed that the original restaurant was no more it was a real haven for me on my first visit but the buffet breakfast and all day snack bar now just didn t cut it for me compared to the proper restaurant of old fortunately there are plenty of eateries nearby which i suspect caused the change to the restaurant
