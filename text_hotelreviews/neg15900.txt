disappointed with the service in the sky bar at night although it was busy as the clipper bar is not open yet i do however think that hotel residents should be a priority otherwise all the hard work from the checkin staff is wasted if both bar and waiter service is operated in sky bar staff need to ensure customers are served promptly or asked to take a seat and a waiter take the orders we waited too long for service both at the bar and for waiter service hopefully this will be improved when hotel fully open
