i asked for a quiet room and was giving one downstairs unfortunately there seemed to be work above so there was drilling early evening and morning after booking i was offered an upgrade to a deluxe room for this sounded good value as deluxe rooms included breakfast on arrival i was told it was only the room that you paid for i felt i had been misled and would never have upgraded had this been clear
