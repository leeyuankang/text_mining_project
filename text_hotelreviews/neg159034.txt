be careful with booking breakfast i had booked per person breakfast which they had no record of on arrival but when i showed them my confirmation they agreed i should have had breakfast included the next day when we went down for breakfast they wanted to charge us for it and again i had to explain that i had already payed for breakfast which was a bit annoying but the staff were very friendly when sorting it out
