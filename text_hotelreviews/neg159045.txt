i booked in for two night when i checked in i was allocated room which is situated on the ground floor behind the bar i checked in at and entered room and found the room to be very small with the majority of floor space taken by the double bed as the room was situated behind the bar the noise from the bar was horrendous and there was no way i could relax after my hour journey to london after contacting reception i was allocated room for the second night this room was ok but had been recently decorated and therefore had a strong smell of paint which was unpleasant
