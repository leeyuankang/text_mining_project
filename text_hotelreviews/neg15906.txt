eighteen bar is stunning and being told by staff to make sure we visit we did bar opened at we decided to have a drink before our dinner reservation at and to check out the fabulous views unfortunately we were still waiting minutes later despite tellling the waitress twice after we had ordered a cocktail and a beer and so we had to leave without having them a great disappointment as the bar wasn t very full either whereas the service we received in clipper bar earlier was excellent we received no apology which was a little disappointing
