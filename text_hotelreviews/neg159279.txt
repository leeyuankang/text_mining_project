the older grey guy on the desk was exceptionally rude and seemed to really dislike me i was told an ice bucket was available for free but aparently midnight was too late to bring one up and i wasnt told there was a time limit on this so that ruined my plans the room was tiny and looked nothing like the photos there wasnt any heating in my room what so ever me and my fianc slept with coats on would not stay here again met two other members of staff on my stay they were friendly and helpful i dont understand why ice could not be taken to my room as o was told i was happy to tip for it but he was just a very miserable unhelpful man not happy with this place at all
