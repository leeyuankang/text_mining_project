the room was very small on the booking info it is written the superior room has that was so not true the room had bathroom included when i have raised the issue with the hotel personnel and i said i want to speak to the manager they said they can offer another room but was basically the same size the manager never showed up and they never answered to the email i sent them the room was not clean i found hair in the bed and the floor was super dirty as well as the closet there are rooms on a very small corridor you can hear everything from the other rooms definetely i will not go there ever based on my own experience i don t recommend this hotel the hotel is close to the metro trocadero but it is not a nice neighbourhood to walk in the evenings very dirty street vendors all over the area in clonclusion not a good experience
