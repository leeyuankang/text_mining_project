extremely disappointed this hotel is a stars level totally overpriced i booked this hotel s lux double room with view to enjoy the view on the eiffel tower for the new year but the truth is that you can see only top of the tower as there is a building just in front of it beside this no toothbrush hand soap etc nothing in the bathroom except a cheap hair body gel dispenser stars hotel you said and the breakfast i ve stay in many different kind of hotels but this one is really a stars level buffet breakfast for euros a total joke even if we got it for free as i complained about the view from the bedroom
