on arrival the reception tried to change our room to a lower floor even though i d paid for our room upgrade and emailed prior to our stay to confirm the view room the breakfast was shockingly awful nothing but stale bread and an empty egg pan left it was inedible actually euros was a disgrace for that i am so glad we didn t eat anything else there no reaction at all when i expressed this to the staff literally a shrug of the shoulders and still charged me awkward and embarrassing not impressed won t be returning for a few reasons which is shame as the location was excellent
