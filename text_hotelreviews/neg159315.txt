overrated location i would expect a view at least at half of the eiffel tower if i pay eur for nights i thought it might be pricy because of the whirlpool bath tub i noted my preference for bath tub it has not been taken into consideration i got a hydromassage shower instead which did not make any sense can be cheap if you go for simple rooms but just because of the view and the jacuzzi it s not worth to pay eur night
