the breakfast was not good we only went for breakfast on the sunday so don t know if it was a one off but was totally understaffed we went at and breakfast was until a m but there were no glasses for the orange juice and virtually no orange juice no knives no croissants and the cold buffet was virtually empty and nobody was replacing anything there were only staff who were working extremely hard but just couldn t cope it took us minutes to get a hot drink it was certainly not worth euros
