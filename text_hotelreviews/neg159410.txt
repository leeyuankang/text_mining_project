imagine there was no quilt cover for the quilt instead the housekeeper prepared our bed by using bed sheets to cover the quilt it was really weird on the day of checkout we asked min in advance to call a taxi to gare de lyon the concierge staff said wait minutes however we wait nearly half an hour till the taxi came we missed our train in the end and repurchased our tickets and we spend extra hours waiting in the train station it was degrees in paris and there was no ac so disappointed
