we asked for a double bed and instead we noticed there was two beds put together the staff were not overly friendly and rooms did not look as nice compared to the photographs limited bath soaps provided as well no conditioner for the price it is not justified sadly i went for this place because of the good reviews and location but actually it s very easy to get around paris wherever you are with uber walking or metro
