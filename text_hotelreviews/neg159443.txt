the central heating system could not be adjusted nor could it be turned on or off from within our triple room we had to call reception repeatedly to have them manually adjust turn on off the heating and this caused some discomfort as we were frequently either too hot or too cold in our room the wifi connection was terrible it cut out several times and was very slow perhaps this was isolated to our part of the floor
