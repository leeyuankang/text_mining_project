very noisy hotel a particular reception staff member was talking so loudly we could here him from our room window upstairs on the floor i do not consider these rooms even remotely sound proof it was frustrating being constantly woken by traffic noise or late night diners leaving and chatting on the street before heading into taxis one night i had to open the window and tell some people who were standing there having an argument to shut up the hotel reception did nothing about asking them to take it elsewhere or to be considerate of other people not impressed there were also renovations going on in the hotel and nearby i had to tell them to stop the drilling in the lower ground floor areas because it was vibrating extremely loudly through the walls and woke us about it was so loud i thought it was coming from the room next door the breakfast was standard and for the price we ate a some gorgeous little cafe s that were in good walking distance hotel did have a buffet that had more choice though if you eat a lot
