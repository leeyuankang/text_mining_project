just a tad disappointed in the room there wasn t a lot of counter top space in the bathroom to put out toiletries other essentials necessitating the need to use the minimal space on night tables and shelf under the tv with armoire and nothing else for clothing and gal pals traveling together it was a tight squeeze for storage the room card for opening the door was also the card you must use to turn on the electricity while this is energy saving knowing in advance would have forced us to bring multiple adapters instead of to recharge all devices at night you can t recharge if you re not in the room while the front desk did have adapters to loan out unfortunately they weren t compatible with my devices
