it would of been courteous and far less embarrassing if the reception staff who directed me to the cocktail bar had informed me that i needed to wear a shirt this i respect but to be told in front of other guests once inside the door was embarrassing i had only just arrived and had not had time to consider the dress code the air conditioning could of been better as i could not get the room temp low enough and the windows did not stay open
