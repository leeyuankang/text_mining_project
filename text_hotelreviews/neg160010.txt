the wifi system never did work well for us as it requires a new login everytime its used and half the time we couldn t log in also we received an emergency call in the middle of the night and the room phones weren t functioning so we didn t get a notice until morning via a note from the front desk also the bathroom cold water faucet leaked every time it was used and created a bit of a mess in the bathroom we notified the front desk twice but they never addressed the issue while we were there during our five day stay so we just dealt with it
