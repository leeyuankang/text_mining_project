the redone rooms are soulless no character at all the hotel had the type of room i liked and it was empty for my stay but would not upgrade without charging me i saw one of the rooms terrible location where the people smoke and drink outside your window the other perfect the room i was given faced a brick wall this is how they treat someone who has been staying there for years they did even know i had stayed there before till they looked it up after i asked to cancel my reservation to shorten my state i was given the better room you have to book a table in the bar even if you are guest the martinis are famous now i understand but shouldn t a guest be able to enjoy a glass a wine in the bar area i walked over to the stafford hotel at breakfast time it was full of guests full of life and delightfully tasteful breakfast is included not at dukes frankly i walk to the wolsey restaurant and have a live y breakfast at half the price better toast and an atmosphere that is lovely dukes breakfast room is so dead you feel you must whisper the same when you order tea in the lounge the staff is nice and helpful but it has lost its charm
