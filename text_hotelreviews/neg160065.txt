i think you need to give a more accurate description of your location on your website while you may officially be at oxford st your entrance is on another street and is not easy to see from oxford street it s fine for those taking a taxi but if you come by tube it is not i spent a hour walking up and down oxford street looking for the hotel elevator dirty same dirt over a hour period spilled liquid dried and with dirt attached key cards faulty had to go back downstairs times because they wouldn t open the room door shower floor very slippery so should have a rubber mat i felt unsafe using the shower especially since i am older and have arthritis provide mats
