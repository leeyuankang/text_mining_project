the overall service was bad lost sunglasses when room was left for cleaning and the staff front desk did not take the compaint seriuously almost lost my package which was sent to hotel because the staff did not deliver it right away to my room nor inform me to pick it up asked my room to be changed to without breakfast but they said it could only be done by booking com in fact i ve tried to put this inquiry right after my booking but booking com responsed was the hotel is already notified it seemed that the hotel preferred the booking made directly through their site they tried helping by calling booking com but booking com said it could not be done because i m arrived already gosh the breakfast itself was not satisfying not so many option for halal food even if all of the foods were halal they didn t look compelling
