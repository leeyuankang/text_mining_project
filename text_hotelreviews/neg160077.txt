requested early check in room not available had to come back after once in room it took over another hour gone to replace a broken toilet seat that they knew was broken when we finally got the room at there were a lot of water splash stains on the bathroom counter and a big wet patch on the carpet by the wardrobe also breakfast was the worst i have had at a radisson blu all the bacon was well overdone scrambled eggs had no flavour were they made from some sort of concentrate and so called hash browns were just large lumps of deep fried mash potatoes nothing like real hash browns they also only had one type of jam in open pots for the croissants and if you wanted toast they only had sliced ciabatta to use
