your ad photo of the standard twin bed room showed the room is big so i booked it when i arrived the fron desk representative told me the room will be too small for us and it was not what shown in the ad and adviced me to upgrade to a different room which i did so your ad was misleading one point i want to add the rooms need more outlets specifically between the beds to charge phones
