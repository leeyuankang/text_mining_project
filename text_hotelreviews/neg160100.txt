breakfast time a bit stressful too busy quite a wait room quite small carpet looked old there seemed to be a problem with our booking on arrival and despite i called to say we were arriving in the morning hours due to a delayed flight the night staff seemed to be unaware which created an awkward situation it was resolved quickly though
