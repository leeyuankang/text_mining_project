hotel didn t offer even a slice of cake on christmas morning breakfast it would have been a good gesture during festive time to put an extra effort for guests staying with you on christmas no staff made an effort to greet merry christmas it looked like they were just rushing to do their job the bathroom was very small congested creaky room floor though carpeted wardrobe door constantly hitting the fridge which was popping out each time no hair dryer in the bathroom
