when we arrived at pm our room was not ready and altough we had had a couple of mail exchange about our room before because we had a child with us even after waiting for the room to be cleaned they could give us really a bad room although it was a king deluxe room but the staff s approach was really helpful and apologatic and to compansate this they transferred us to a suite next they and we had complimentary breakfast suite room was big for london standarts and comfortable but there were some technical problems blinking lamps dripping sink broken hairdryer etc after experiencing the room we stayed first night we decided that in case we go to london again we d stay in this hotel only if we can afford the suite room which is quite expensive
