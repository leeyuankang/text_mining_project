considering i had booked a deluxe room for one night for in aid of my partner s birthday i at least expected cleanliness i couldn t have been more wrong and we were so disappointed the first thing that we noticed when we walked in was a giant dirty stain that looked like washed blood on the large cushion on the bed the bathroom was not clean and the shower had someone elses hair in it disgusting we had a dinner reservation so i didn t have time to complain about the state of the bathroom at the time i just had to get ready given the importance of the occasssion however i was so dispointed my partner did however go to reception and made a complaint to them with the receptionist advising that they would look in to the matter and it was his birthday i then mentioned the issues and my disappointment myself when i came downstairs to reception on our way out again i was offered an apology and advised that someone would look in to it for us there was literally no concierge service which for a hotel like this in the location the hotel is based is ridiculous we had to walk in the pouring rain in evening dress to the high end restaurant that we had a reservation for there was only one member of staff to be found on reception and they couldn t source a cab for us at all central london when we came to check out the following day i was waiting for someone to acknowledge the issues that we had raised the previous evening which had really put such a negative edge on our stay apart from anything else do you think i could sleep well wondering if the sheets and pillows were as dirty as everything else however absolutely nothing was mentioned not even an apology i was too angry to say anything after i was even charged for the two drinks we had had and left thinking that there is no way that i would be staying there again absolute disgrace for a radisson
