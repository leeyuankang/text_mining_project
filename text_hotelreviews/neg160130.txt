poorly designed rooms with very small bed shower with only shower head and toilet with no toilet brush the bed and room was definitely not designed for people as there is a bed of length and the reading lights light up half the whole bed i am staying in room if one of the guests decides to read a book both should better put on a pair of good sunglasses if a lady decides to use the shower she better be prepared to rinse her hair as there is only a fixed shower head if she also decides to wash her private sector she better start somersaults against the wall to get exposure the lack of toilet brush is a strong default as well the hotel itself is clean and the stuff friendly
