the sound proofing offered by the room door was non existent and a large gap between the door and the floor allowed light to fill the room from the hallway at night we used the bathmat to seal the light out and wore earplugs to drown out the hallway noise not sure if this issue affects all rooms but the doors in our room could certainly stand to be addressed
