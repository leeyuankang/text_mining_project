the room was very tiny there was barely enough room for our suitcases at first the reception refused to give us a twin bed room he said that it was full house already and allocated us in a double room in the smoking area on the first floor we complained that i had a throat problem and it was then that they moved us up to the fourth floor with a double bed the air con in the room did not work very well and we called for extra blankets for two times and waited for at least an hour but still no one came by then we were too tired and dozed off to sleep we had expected better service for a radisson hotel but it was really disappointing
