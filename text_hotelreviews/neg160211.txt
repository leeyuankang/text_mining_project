when we arrived we where met by a very nice gentleman whom checked us in and told us where our room was and that it was all ready for us to go up early check in our room was right beside a building site when we looked out the window we where staring right into the workmen faces they even gave us a smile and a wave they where that close not appropriate for a mother with a teenage daughter to be facing onto i asked to be moved and they moved us one floor up to the same horrid dirty brown room no bedside lamps dirty carpets old bathroom one word shabby i then complained to booking com and was told to let the hotel manager sort something out the only thing i wanted them to do was move us to another hotel so i gave them a chance and we got a nicer room on the floor and yes guess what another building site only this time a generator when all night i tried calling booking com back and waited nearly an hour for them to answer but we had a reservation to go to so i had to leave it at that on the monday we were woken to the sound of the fire alarm at then again at to be told it was the toaster in the restaurant causing the problem this happened several times and no staff let us know what was going on i had to phone down and ask the reception myself having to cue up for breakfast every morning was ridiculous too surely they must know how many guest they have staying in the hotel the whole experience was horrific it was my time taking my daughter away since her dad died and i certainly didn t expect unfriendly unmannerly staff and a very poor standard and quality of hotel i stay in london regularly and have stayed in some beautiful hotels no way is this hotel worth the price try somewhere else trust me
