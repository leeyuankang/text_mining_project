the housekeeping staff the one we came across at least was rather rude we needed a baby cot and there was one in the room when we arrived but it was broken then we called the housekeeping and the one of the house keeping staff female who came to replace it she tried to convince us that it was not broken then when the room attendant decided to replace it she brought as girl s cot and in a way although we mentioned that our baby was a boy we had to put the baby for the duration of the stay in a girls cot apart from the housekeeping room attendants the other staff at the reception were really polite and nice concerning the size of rooms and hotel facilities these were really small lift very very small can only fit three people or one person with a baby pram reception area extremely small and when people have luggage a the the space become even more squashy standard room really really small fitness facilities such as a pool steam bath etc which are mentioned in the website we were informed by the reception staff that hotel customers can use the fitness facilities of other partner hotels in the area this means that information on the hotel website are misleading potential customers overall we feel that this hotel is the worst by far option of a hotel for booking your holidays
