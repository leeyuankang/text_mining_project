i am aware that hotel standards in london are different from other places and that prices are also very high especially in the city however i do expect the room to be dusted and i surely don t expect to see any cockroaches i know this is a problem in london but i think it s a pitty to see this in what seems to be one of the better hotels i hope they take care of this soon
