our room wasn t clean properly when we arrived late afternoon we reported it to the reception asking for a more efficient cleaning next morning but there was still dust on the blinders enough to write your name on it there is noise from oxford str and from a nearby construction which is really annoying and wakes you up from the cleaning room service staff wasn t qualified we asked for an extra bed in the room the man who brought it left all the plastic covers tapes extra pillowcases in the room when he finished not to mention that he was t able to set the extra bed by himself and we had to help him there is only an open wardrobe no room for socks tights underwears etc the reception is really small and gets overcrowded with persons
