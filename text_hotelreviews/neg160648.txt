the meal in the restaurant was average we opted for the tapas as main course and it was greasy and repetitive i saw a small selection of dishes already laid out at in the heat of the restaurant the staff said there would be more out later the menu card was dirty and we couldn t understand why anyone would serve turkey as the roast of the day unfortunately the beds were of poor quality and cheap so we got little sleep on both nights i put my duvet under me to not feel the springs most hotels of this calibre all have pillow top mattresses despite friendly staff and great location we will not stay again which is a pity
