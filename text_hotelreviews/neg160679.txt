we had a very difficult check in by a young man must have gotten the worst room in the hotel floor so bad that i forgot the room number after nights we finally got a good room housekeeping very slow sitting waiting for housekeeping at been staying here a few times before and been very happy on previous stays this time most things are not working out even mention that s it is our wedding anniversary but not even the smallest gesture cristina in reception is lovely don t think we will return here rooms for one full week maby it s just to much in one place bar in reception very nice
