i placed the request for a specific room and the option if tha room would be occupied the request was ignored as well as the option to that such as the other option was to get a room with a view on the main entrance of hotel instead of the train rails that i ended up staying in plus it was really noise on the floor such as few people where drinking and laughting in their rooms all evening long until late times would be nice if staff paid more attention to those comments customers upt in the request forms receptionists are not showing a good custimer service at the check in process no smiling very abrupt way of talking
