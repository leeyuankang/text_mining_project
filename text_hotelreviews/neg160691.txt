parking it is not per day it s per day but the day you check in is counted as a full day so arriving at thurs and leaving at sat cost us this is not clear on booking com and the hotel say is out of their hands however they conveniently didn t mention it when we checked in as far as i m concerned a two night stay in a hotel where it states so much per day should cost you twice that figure also our room wasn t serviced despite us being out all day we had to ring reception when we got back and it was then done at and to top it all the shower was broken boiling water pouring from the top of the over sized showerhead so needed replacing and meant we couldn t shower on the first morning all in all very disappointing and the first of many stays via booking com that didn t live up to expectations i ve had better experiences booking premier inn direct
