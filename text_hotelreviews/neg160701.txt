i thought the staff were rude and unattentive we had a light supper in the bar and the staff were too busy talking amongst themselves to notice the guests the food was very very mediocre and very expensive i ordered a bowl of olives that came in a bowl swimming with oil but nothing to get them out with there were no napkins the table was wet where the drinks were put straight onto the glass table breakfast was only as good as a holiday inn and yet again the staff were awful this experience cost definitely not worth that price
