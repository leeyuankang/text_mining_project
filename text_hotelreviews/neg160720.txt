even in central london i expect breakfast to be included for over a night not that it mattered on this occasion i had to check out too early the spa is pleasant but rather small and basic with half a dozen people present it felt crowded the location is nice enough between the thames and battersea park but getting there by public transport involved a long walk ironic when the train line runs right by the hotel
