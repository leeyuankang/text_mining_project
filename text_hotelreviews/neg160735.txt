the check in staff weren t as polite as expected trying to sort a query out with another member of staff in the middle of checking me in took so much time that i had to interrupt and ask him to check me in first as i had a baby past his bedtime due to chelsea bridge road closure also baby cot i asked for was appalling the mattress didn t even fit so i had to pad the bottom part out with the bath towels and put extra blankets over the whole thing for some comfort
