the service left a bit to be desired for example we ordered room service with a soda that required an opener they didn t provide us with an opener and when i requested one it was never delivered we needed an iron which was brought to us quickly however it didn t work cleanliness was pretty good but the couch was dirty and there were spots on the blanket on the bed
