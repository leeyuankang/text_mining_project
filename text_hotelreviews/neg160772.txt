the staff were not friendly we were initially shown into a room for people with disabilities where the sink in the bathroom was blocked we did not request accessible room we asked to be moved the room we were then offered was on the third floor facing the train trucks so we could hear the trains passing every few minutes almost through the night we couldn t us the pool because children were only allowed from am till pm and we checked in at pm and had to check out the next day at am unfortunately the pool was a key reason for us to book the hotel in the first place overall i felt the hotel was a really bad value for money won t be going there again
