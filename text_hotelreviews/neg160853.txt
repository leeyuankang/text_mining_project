parking house which the hotel uses are rude and expensive they were the first time we stayed and nothing has changed although we complained to both parties there is no hotel rate and although hours monday to friday is if you enter at sunday and exit at monday they charge you and every time you pop out it starts again unbelievable that there is still no concession for the hotel guests like other hotels young kids can only use the swimming pool between and which we understand but it is a ridiculously short time particularly for families who may book because of the pool spa did not pick up the phone so we went to ask and they said no even though there was another girl in the pool which caused our daughter to cry they need to sort out their policy
