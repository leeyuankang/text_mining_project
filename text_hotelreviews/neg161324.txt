front desk staff was terrible rude and not helpful actually they were not accommodating to a family with children at all i would not stay here again with a family if you are a couple or business traveler and stay without asking for anything in addition it would be okay the hotel really needs to work on their customer service and attitude towards their customers both my wife and i left feeling almost guilty for staying there with children would not stay here again considering the amount of money you spend per night
