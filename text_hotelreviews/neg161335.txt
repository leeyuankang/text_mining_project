we stayed at the arbour for nights our room was on the ground floor at the front of the hotel and was very noisy locals stood right outside our bedroom window on the street every day talking from so it was impossible to sleep in the room service was lacking every day the bed throw was left lying on the chair the dressing gown lying on the floor dirty glass next to the bed tea sachets often not replenished considering this is a star hotel i believe the room service was sub standard
