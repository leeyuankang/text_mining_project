the hotel staff does not have information of the city they do not know the area very junior staff with no experience in dealing with clients they asked for a deposit and gave us a handwritten receipt on a sheet of paper and told us that if we lost the receipt they could not return the deposit it s a shame that they do not invest in more prepared staff
