last minute communication from the hotel that the nearest tube station lancaster gate was closed when they d known for weeks was a bit naughty didn t give us time to cancel and choose somewhere else and we would have cancelled so perhaps that s why they didn t contact us we knew that the hotel was a stop away from marble arch so thought we d be able to get everywhere we wanted easily however as tube station was closed we jumped on a bus and it took over an hour and a half to get to the hotel from regent street our late arrival at the hotel meant we had just time to change to get a taxi costing to get to the theatre in time we weren t up to walking to another tube station so taxi it was so hotel fab but management informing us of lancaster gate closing poor costing us taxi there and back
