the staff are very stuffy and not helpful they ask at sign in for your passport and your children s passports i didn t bring them but i had other forms of identification but they were insistent on having your passports and almost wouldn t let me check in there are not many plugs in the room there were two in mine above a desk far from the bed or anywhere convenient the breakfast is okay at best and my family and i all got sick shortly after eating you have to turn in your key to the front desk anytime you depart the room that s a security concern for me while there s safes in the room i ve never had to turn in a key just to step out of the hotel also there isn t much around the hotel or to do in the hotel there s a pretty lounge at the entrance but it looks merely for show not for comfort won t stay here again
