upon checking in we were told that the central heating wasn t working and were given a small heater for the cold room then we discovered that the bed wasn t changed from the last guest and there were hairs all over under the sheets while we were waiting for the change the receptionist who hasn t seen the room tried to play down the situation by saying that it might have been hairs from the cleaners innocent perhaps but this comment definitely did not help with soothing our mood on the positive side we were offered complementary drinks and breakfast upgrades however upon checkout we were asked to pay pounds for the drinks when we explained that these should have been complementary the receptionist the one with the glass was more busy with telling us what information she had on the computer than with correcting the situation after repeating herself for the time we asked her to stop and simply check us out she replied i m not going to argue with you for pounds which we found were completely rude and inappropriate given the situation was created by the hotel staff in the first place all in all while the room was okay and there were quite other friendly and helpful staff this is not the experience one would expect from a four star hotel additionally the soundproof was pretty bad towels were old would not recommend it nor consider staying there again
