the staff are extremely rude shortly after i checked out of this hotel i received a phone call from reception accusing me of stealing there pillows the breakfast was very poor quality there was not a kettle provided in our room to make a cup of tea so upon asking reception to solve this issue they told us to use the hot water from the coffee machine we attempted this and was completely disgusted with the results it looked like the water was taken from the river nile
