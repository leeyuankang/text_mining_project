we d been travelling around europe for six months and this was by far the most expensive hotel we stayed at perhaps our expectations were too high but this hotel was far from being good value for money the room was large enough but even though there was a cubicle for it there was no fridge so if you wanted to have a cold drink you had to buy it from the hotel the wardrobe was barely eight inches wide the lounge chairs were the formwork type and there was no table to go with them the workbench for computers had only one chair perhaps this hotel is just indicative of how little you get for your money in london
