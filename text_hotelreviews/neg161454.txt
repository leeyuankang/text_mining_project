being asked to pay for all five nights stay prior to being let into room weeks prior to our stay we emailed informing the hotel we would be arriving around tired from driving from wales then a train trip we were informed after the first night had already been charged to our credit card this was acceptable but we were then asked to pay for the remaining four nights up front before being let into the room this has never happened in any hotel we have stayed in before we were told this was hotel policy i wanted to pay with my bank issued travel money card which was loaded with gbp which i paid my hotel bill in wales etc rather than a credit card which was would carry transaction fees the receptionist refused my card as my name didn t appear on it sent to then find cash very tired and unhappy now couldnt withdraw full amount from service station cash point said i would withdraw balance from the bank next day requested to be let into our room as the night was paid for she was completely inflexible and still wouldn t let us into the room even though first night was fully paid for finally another staff member arrived i then proved the money card was mine by logging onto netbank and matching card account number he then showed some flexibility and allowed us to pay with a card we had used successfully all month throughout uk europe this left a bad first impression which spoiled our hotel stay also asked for fifty pound deposit on room key
