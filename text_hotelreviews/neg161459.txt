worst hotel experience in my life first of all they ask you for a pound deposit for damages and they don t have a mini bar the staff worst staff i ve had to deal with except for one tall dark bell boy at the front desk talks to the guests in a patronizing way got upgraded to a room number the noisiest room i ve ever stayed in on the ground floor and next to the kitchen so you hear everything on the street even if someone is just walking and you hear them preparing breakfast from i don t know when the room has flight of stairs that lead to the bathroom so if you have to go to the bathroom you go to an upper floor imagine doing that in the middle of the night i d rather sleep finally you have to leave your room key when you leave
