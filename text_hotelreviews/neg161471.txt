beware to choose a room with few stair steps as we ve been offered a room that has a lot of stairs to climb and decent as well in order to reach it in which we totally refused and we were offered a room with steps to climb only the elevator was working fine the room lacked a refrigerator all rooms don t have it but we were offered to keep our water bottle in the bar refrigerator downstairs the water pressure in the shower was weak the room was part of a connected rooms system in which we could hear our neighbours clearly through the connecting door as well as their cell phone on viabration mode
