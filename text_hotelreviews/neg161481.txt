noise from adjoining room could hear practically everything staff were informed and we asked that they speak with the occupants or new people checking in however the only advice they could give was to call reception if there was a problem but this would have been in the middle of the night we would have preferred the occupants to have been spoken to when checking in and or a notice put on the adjoining doors to advise people that noise between rooms is an issue
