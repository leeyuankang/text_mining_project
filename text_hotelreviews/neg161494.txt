we booked a club room this is the smallest room and our experience was that this was very small we ended up changing rooms times in a two night stay maybe we were too fussy but i don t think so once to move away from a room next to the lift once to move to a room with a decent sized bed some have only standard doubles in fairness the staff were very accommodating and we did end up in good sized club room breakfast is included but on booking com it is not clear that this is continental breakfast and there is a surcharge for a cooked breakfast
