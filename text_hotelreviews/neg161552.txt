i was shocked with the reservation manager s attitude he told me to treat him well and then he can treat me well and help me the issue is about our old daughter could not stay with us even not asked for a baby cot after i shared my disappointment about it they discussed and he told me that we could stay together but told us that we had breakfast for two only so my little daughter could not this is the most strangest thing i have ever faced in my life after being asked that i have to treat him well and its a prerequisite for us to get help from them is exactly is a threatining thing so strongly not recommended and please be careful with the reservation manager because he was so close to attack me following his threatining sentences
