reserved a executive double room which would have been perfect site said kids welcome called in advance and was told that coming with two kids and was no problem on arrival manager said it would have been ok if the younger child was or less and appeared to only want to make us pay more at all price felt disgusted and trapped and decided that if i had to pay more at least they won t benefit so we decided to split my wife and kids stayed and i booked a single room in a cheap hotel within walking distance talk about ruined vacation there are lots of other nice hotels in the area i know i ll avoid this one in the future
