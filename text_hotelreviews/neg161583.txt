the elevator sucks big time after we arrived in this hotel we saw them working on it already but after few days it was terrible they should replace the elevator my sister got trapped inside and the bell was not working luckily she brought her phone with her and she called me up through facebook messenger while she was inside it it took some time for them to get her out the room was not that clean i know if the place is dusty because i keep sneezing they didn t replace the sheets everyday the water pressure was very poor one of reason i like to stay in hotel because of water volume but that s not the case here in this hotel i choose this hotel for good review and well for the price but i should have stay in some well known hotel if i can turn back the time so problems like this won t be encountered by me i have a small baby and climbing to floor in the stairs was hell the reception said sorry about it but not sincerely and according to him sometimes this kind of event will happen to anyone given it s gonna be but atleast the bell still working so someone can ask for help and seems like if someone will die inside they won t take accounts with it upon arrival we were so tired to eat outside so i decided to order a pizza and they served us a pizza where it was still cold in the center we put a note and they gave me a note as well apologizing for it and box of chocolate that was sweet of them but they should be more professional enough to sell their services and products so the money paid in exchange will be well compensated if this will be the life in london oh well i won t dare to go back and if i do i will book in some reputable hotel where the percentage of this events will be so unlikely to happen
