staff are largely disinterested the room i had was tiny at the back of the hotel and smelt of cannabis the room service was really bad a very limited menu of about sandwiches which weren t all available the fresh soup was cold in the middle and the homemade crusty bread was two pieces of toasted sliced white bread not what you expect from a high quality hotel at all the first time i stayed here last year it was lovely though i didn t eat there then and there seems to be an overall decline in quality since then
