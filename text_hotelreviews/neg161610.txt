the doors dont have an additional lock so they close automaticly at around midnight someone walked into our room and my girlfriend woke up and started screaming and offcourse i woke then up aswell but just saw the guy leaving our room we called the staff to complain and he said nothing is wrong with the door and he cant do anything great service then i tried to put some chairs and luggage in front of the door so its not going to happen again after what happened we couldnt fall asleep anymore the hotel is very noisy and anytime we heard some noice i checked the door honestly just not right after i needed to sent emails to complain i finally got an answer they said its my fault that and i probably didnt close the door right remember the automatic closing and looking door but its my fault so after i said that i want my money back they offered me a crazy discount of for my next stay in their hotel no customer service we really stayed in alot of different hotel around the world but i never had such a bad customer service and experience
