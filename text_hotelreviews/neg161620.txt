when we booked the room months ago we mentioned that we have a child of years old and wanted a family room on arrival they put us into a basement room which is damp and smelly we naturally asked for transfer to a room upstairs the manager insisted that we pay pounds more before we could move upstairs in such case we had to do so i am unhappy as we travelled with family and friends breakfast staff was not hospitable
