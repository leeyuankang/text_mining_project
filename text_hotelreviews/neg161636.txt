check in was very automated not many pleasantries very quick and regimented the receptionist that checked us in and out also answered the phone to someone else on both occasions after working in hotels myself i would expect her to ignore it or at leats say do you mind if i answer this rather than just doing it and making the guests in front of her wait and not have a great impression of the customer service once at our room and the concierge helping with our luggage i shortly saw that our room was awful not what was shown on the website that we had booked at all as soon as i walked into the room and the concierge had left i told my partner i would not be staying in the room i went back down to reception and explained how disappointed i was the room was cramped not an executive as we had booked dark and not what we expected especially as it was a special occasion for us our year anniversary a very kind gentleman called gabriel showed me to another room although the same type of room executive it was more spacious lighter and the little seating area had enough room for to enjoy the space opposed to just room for one in our original room once moved we just relaxed in our room before making our way to winter wonderland our reason for going on return i asked for champagne glasses and a bottle opener to be bought to the room within minutes we had it and that was it for the night breakfast was included in our room rate although not cooked so we still had to pay for this very confusing on booking and also on check in we got given a voucher for for breakfast so we didn t have to pay full price neither of us really understood as it wasn t explained very well but we used it anyway my boyfriend ordered the arbor breakfast full english and was very happy unfortunately i cannot say the same i ordered eggs royale english muffin smoked salmon poached egg and hollandaise sauce
