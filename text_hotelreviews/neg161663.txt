i booked the hotel because it appeared to be a boutique hotel offering comforts such as an espresso machine but then the room had no fridge and cheap nasty long life milk breakfast service did not start until weekdays far too late and i ordered a takeaway breakfast on a day i had to leave early and received a stale sandwich orange juice and a banana when i was asked what the breakfast was like i said the sandwich was stale and perhaps some dry biscuits with ham and cheese would be a better option and i was told bad luck there seems to be a like it or lump it attitude with the staff i did leave my luggage in storage at the hotel for the day after checking out i had left some toiletries in my room but when i returned to collect my luggage this was not mentioned surely it is the hotel s responsibility to notify a customer if they have left something in their room there is a much better value hotel currently being refurbished a couple of blocks away and i will stay there next time i am in london
