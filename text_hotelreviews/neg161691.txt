i had a basement room which is only accessible by stairs although stairs aren t extensive i was helped with my luggage on arrival i did have to make a point of asking for help on other occasions of my stay due to carrying luggage back forth to meetings in out of hotel as a designer carrying many garment samples there was also some confusion at check in that my boss had booked the reservation when i told them several times in fact i had made the booking myself on both our behalfs that i found was quite rude my name was on booking so it was clear i made reservation in a way as i felt they weren t taking me seriously as a business traveller room service menu has good selection although standard of food was poor for a hotel of this price rating can t comment on breakfast as i didn t have time to try it upon leaving hotel at any time you are required to hand in keys at reception which i found a little extreme although well presented hotel feels like you are in someone s home rather than an actual hotel was woken up several times on night by the resident in the room next to me walls are thin i could hear them talking knocking the walls repeatedly trying to put a plug in the wall presumably possibly drunk worse for wear as i could hear staff coming up down to attend to them slamming doors etc
