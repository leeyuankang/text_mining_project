the staff is not very kind especially the people of the reception do not know to give instructions such as the buses restaurants etc it seems that they are only trained to charge and don t care about giving other kind of services they really need to get more information about this i found the relation cost versus quality of the service very poor i asked for a wakeup call and they just forgot about it i think this is the minimum you can get for the price of the room i paid fortunately i put my alarm otherwise i would have lost my train it seems that they are just starting to be trained however the cost of the rooms are high so we should get the equivalent in the service
