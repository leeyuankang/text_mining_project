the double bed in our club double room was actually a double most hotels we ve stayed in have queen size beds described as doubles can t fault this as the bed was correctly described the hotel requires guests to hand in their room key each time they leave the hotel then ask for it on return to the hotel this isn t ideal when there is only one person on reception they are already serving a guest one day my partner i came to uplift the room key found reception busy we each took turns visiting the bathroom still had to wait to get the room key it was an inconvenience seems a little silly
