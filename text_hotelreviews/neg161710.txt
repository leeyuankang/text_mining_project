the hotel is well appointed but it felt a bit clinical and not particularly warm and welcoming no designated smoking area so we had to stand out in the street in all weather with no ashtrays etc we had to ask for extra supplies eg coffee pods tea bags as minimum were provided bathroom supplies weren t always replenished either small things really as it is a lovely boutique hotel in an excellent location
