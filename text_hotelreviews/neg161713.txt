cramped mean looking basic room and amenities no wardrobe hardly enough space to open your cases just a horrible atmosphere and a characterless place to stay if you are on holiday in london the staff are surly and unhelpful everything is too much trouble for them there are extra charges for everything hidden in the small print at check in definitely not recommended and it does not deserve a high rating the reception appeared to be constantly busy handling complaints from clients
