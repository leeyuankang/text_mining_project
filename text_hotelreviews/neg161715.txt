i found the staff at this hotel to be rather cold and suspicious of the guests they seemed very anxious that we were going to break something or not do something according to their rules no one who worked in the hotel was english all staff seemed to hail from eastern europe they were professional but there was not a sense of a warm welcome and that they would try to accommodate the needs of the guest they made us hand in our keys each time we left the hotel which was a bit concerning regarding privacy and lent itself to the general feeling of they were watching us and suspicious of our behavior one had the impression it was being run by the russian mafia i also had problems with the plumbing it smelled like a sewer on the entire floor and i called it to their attention and they didn t get it fixed rooms carry a lot of noise between and between floors poor sound proofing expensive for this level of service
