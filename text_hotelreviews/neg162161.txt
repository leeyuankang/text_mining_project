the hotel itself is rather far way from the city center next to the paris expo in my opinion it should be subjected to major renovation already to keep it s stars bathroom facilities are falling apart and appear to be in bad shape also i stayed on the smoking floor and i could smell the cigarette smoke i can t understand why they allow to smoke in any rooms at least for the risk of fire anyway it wasn t so bad but next time i will choose something else
