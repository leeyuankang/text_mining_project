when we were there there was construction just next to the room you can hear the noise from the construction and the street one of the rooms i book is just on the ground floor seems there is a wrong design on the bath room there is no difference on the level of the shower nor the barrier so the water flood the whole bath room funnily they provided the broom to sweep the water from the floor
