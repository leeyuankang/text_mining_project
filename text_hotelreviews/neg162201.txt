i had a basement room at the front the construction of the new building opposite goes on hours so very noisy i suspect this will be ok once finished the room is very small but not dissimilar to other local hotels in the city the immediate basics were clean i e slink shower furniture and bedlinen but the rest was filthy thick dust on top of the skirting boards all the corners full of dust and debris the phone did not work and there was no extra way of locking the door so i felt a little vulnerable on my own the bed was rock hard and i like a hard mattress normally so i had a bad nights sleep due to the hard bed and the noise and do not intend to stay there again in the foreseeable future
