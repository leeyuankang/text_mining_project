i found the attitude of the staff disgusting i have photographic evidence that pre authorization and pre payment was not required however they did a preauthorisation for the full amount which blocked money on my account and then they did it again a couple of days before the stay when i rang to query why they had done this twice whoever was answering the phone first tried to tell me they hadn t done any previous preauthorization i asked about what if i wanted to pay cash for my stay and she stated that they would then refund my card so essentially i was expected to pay for my hotel stay prior to going there in general just found the whole hotels processes shoddy and not customer friendly at all and was so put off i didn t even go and stay there and found a decent better hotel with friendly staff elsewhere
