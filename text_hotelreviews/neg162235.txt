staff at entrance was pretty rude when arriving early for check in despite having informed the hotel beforehand only when asked if she s going to kick me out she offered my baggage to leave there the rooms are super tiny though if you have hand luggage only and for night it is bearable my room only had a window in the bathroom kinda claustrophobic sleeping in a blind room lots of strong led lights in the rooms which cannot be switched off
