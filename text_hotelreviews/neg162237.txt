this single room was little bigger than the bed just enough space for a drop down table next to the bed and a cupboard with fridge and hanging space at the head of the bed huge tv on wall at end of bed if you like such things however i didn t really mind all that the thing that let it down in my opinion was the poor quality towels and the absence of any form of mattress protector which meant seeing and feeling the mattress through the thinnish bottom sheet i thought this odd as it must surely benefit the hotel to protect its mattresses
