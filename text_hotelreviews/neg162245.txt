temperature in the room was a nasty thing to control without the aircon turned on it was too hot but if you turned on the aircon you would find out it s definitely not that silent for people needing to sleep in silence it not advisable sink in the bathroom was so small to make anything almost impossible without spilling water anywhere although bathroom was clean enough there was some mold to be removed from shower stall no breakfast possible at all unless you want to enjoy the breakfast kit provided in your room
