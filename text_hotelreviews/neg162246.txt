the hotel was disgusting the toilet smelt so bad it stunk out the whole room it was vile and there were no other rooms available so we had to stay in it the room was dirty and my pillow was covered in what looked like blood the staff were unhelpful and didn t seem to think it was an issue to sleep in a room that smelt like a sewer and was filthy
