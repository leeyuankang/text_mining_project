i have not been in many hotels in london but thought the room was tiny compared to what is paid for it euro a night maybe london is just expensive and this is normal the room really is tiny but they do try to make the most of it eg the desk fold out from the wall and the not so comfortable wooden chair is kept under the bed the bathroom is surprisingly large compared to the rest there is no bathtub other negative things very close to construction work which can be heard not very peaceful if you want to sleep during the day as others have mentioned in their reviews it can get very hot inside and there s very little control on this it seems like a waste of energy money the airco only seems to work for a while and then switch off not handy if you want a cooler sleep some tv channels were not working well summary this is quite a small room for what you pay
