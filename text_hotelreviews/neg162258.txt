felt a bit awkward walking into the main reception the staff didn t seem the most welcoming and it all felt a bit uncomfortable checking in walking through reception each time we left returned to the premises probably didn t help that it was small and very quiet didn t see any other guests there and there was one member of staff sat at reception in silence with no music or background noise they also didn t explain that we needed to put the key in the slot on the wall to be able to use the electric until i went back down to reception to ask why the electrics wouldn t work shower leaked onto the floor when used room was insanely hot all night kept turning the aircon on but the temperature seemed to keep climbing after a certain period of time overall it was decent enough just not the most comfortable of hotel stays i ve had nor worth the price i paid though it was booked on shiort notice
