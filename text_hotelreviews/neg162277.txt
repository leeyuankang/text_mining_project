the room originally allocated to us appears to have had a plumbing problem and we were notified the afternoon prior to arrival we were attending a weeding in central london with an overnight stay and at that late juncture had no option but to accept a small double bed in a single room we negotiated a slight reduction in the room charge but when asked why us we were told that we were the only people staying for one night and so we were seen as easier for the hotel to change our room not altogether satisfactory for us but there was nothing we could do about it
