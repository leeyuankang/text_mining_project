the hotel itself was very pleasant and served the purpose it was required for however at no point during my booking were we advised that the outside the hotel is a construction site a huge construction site we were located at the front on the hotel on the first floor our view being that of cranes diggers steel gurdles and scaffolding at this point on arrival we were thoroughly disappointed but thought its ok and that the site wouldn t be active over the weekend we couldn t have been more wrong we were woken at by our room vibrating as the workmen proceeded to drill in to the pavement directly below our window i have to say i am extremely disappointed and annoyed that this quite obvious disruption was not mentioned to us previous to or during the booking stage very disappointed and disgruntled
