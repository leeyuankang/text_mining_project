the window was not opening so it was pretty hot inside but i think it was my fault i did something wrong when trying to open it the aircon was good but switched off during the night after h so i needed to switch it on during the night but here i just got unlucky the stuff suggested me to move to another room but i just was lazy to do so so not complaining
