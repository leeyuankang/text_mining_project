feels very claustrophobic as hotel is very small more like a windows don t close properly and let a cold draft in we had to put towels to block the cold draft i fell ill and was offered compensation so far i have received nothing from the hotel management not even an apology hotel is in front of a building site which can get very noisy no room service i have stayed in much bigger hotels for half the price this is only suitable for one person and not two too small for couples
