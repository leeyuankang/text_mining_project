i had no complaints at all there is only one point and that is that the ground floor rooms should be double glazed as there was considerable noise from outside this didn t cause me too many problems but it is worthy of note another thing is that the hotel website refers to complimentary breakfast while booking com says no breakfast the breakfast that the hotel refers to is the fridge with snacks such as cereal bars and blueberry muffins alongside the tea and coffee tray this works for me but perhaps the website could be clearer
