my double room was ridiculously small i had read the rooms were small so had thankfully paid extra for a double on arrival there was no cupboard space not even to hang a coat or dress only a small space for a few shirts nowhere to put luggage so was tripping over bags in the tiny space impossible to imagine two people having to share this room the bathroom was also very snug and smelt of cat pee the shower doesn t drain properly and therefore floods the towels were small rough and not good quality no excuse for this and easy to remedy bed was hard and tv reception came and went am really surprised that booking com had given this hotel stars would really not recommend not good value for money
