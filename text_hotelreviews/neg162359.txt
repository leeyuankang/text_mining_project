the single room was very small and extremely hot making sleeping difficult i had to change my booking on a non refundable rate and whilst allowing me to change to another date i was charged more despite my reason for change was an unexpected hospital appointment for my wife s cancer seemed mean to me allowing the date change at the same rate was all i was asking
