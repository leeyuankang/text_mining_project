surly receptionist when i checked in smallest hotel room i have ever stopped in literally inches round the side of the bed all round no room for a table or anywhere to put my luggage there was only two foot height in the cupboard for hanging clothes so i couldn t even hang my jacket or trousers up shower room was ridiculously tiny couldn t properly sit on the toilet it was so narrow my colleagues and i were hoping this would be the new place for us to stop given its proximity to the office however i couldn t recommend it to anyone other than as a last minute booking if you get it cheap there is much better out there
