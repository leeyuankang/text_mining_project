our stay was terrible when we just arrived at the hotel the receptionist received us with such an i don t care attitude that we started to suspect she assigned us to a ground floor room and without asking or letting us know she sent us to a room with private bathroom with no wc door you can imagine how embarrassing that can be when you use the toilet when we realized about this obviously we asked why was that and she told us that this was the only double room available in the property on the next day she offered to switch us to a different room with a double bed so she lied about the only room with double bed in the property the other room was extremely small and in front of the bathroom door there was a dark cm sticky stain in the carpet we didn t realize that it was a vomit stain until the last day unfortunately we stayed for some nights and every night when we returned to the room it was a disguisting smell we thought it was something related to the toilet given that it s an old building but unfortunately we slept and lived with that smell but that s not all the night before to the last night we heard something like a dripping water sound late in the night when we turned on the lights we saw that it was a huge amount of water falling from the upper floor maybe from a pipe over the suspended ceiling over our toilet i dressed up and went to the reception immediately to ask for help to the receptionist the answer he gave me was it s too late in the night there s no one i can call to help us please go up and tell me how much time it takes to the water to stop i asked so you were aware of that problem previously right he didn t answer as you can imagine our stay was a nightmare the morning when we left the hotel we complained about the leaking and the vomit smell and obviously asked for a compensation
