room was tiny although very well designed to maximize the space and was fine for one person whilst it was a double bed i can only assume i stayed in a single room to be fair to the hotel i didn t book the room so i don t know how it was advertised it would not have been suitable for two people to share due to lack of space the bed was built in with one side up against a wall bathroom window overlooked by offices in courtyard and should ideally have been frosted glass blinds for privacy
