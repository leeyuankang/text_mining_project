our room was located downstairs in front of the reception where the shower cabin doesnt have any edge so when we started having a shower in few seconds the whole bathroom was inundated by the water there was a mop kind tool but unfortunately didnt help much so after that we couldnt reach the toilet without street shoes and there was no door on the toilet beside the bathroom problem we were satisfied with the hotel especially with the location
