the room we got was right next to the reception and near a busy road so didn t feel very private the room although advertised and charged for as a double was far too small for two people there was no room to walk about the bed was stood against the wall with a window on one side otherwise it wouldn t fit in it feels like an old building was turned into a modern hotel trying to squeeze in as many rooms as possible to make money compromising on the size and the service since there is no breakfast available it is by no means a bad hotel but i feel we were charged for its location rather than for what we got
