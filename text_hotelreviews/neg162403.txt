firstly i requested an upper floor but on arrival was given a basement room the receptionist did offer another room and also suggested that next time we got in touch direct however that s why we used booking com and i feel this is a poor service by them as it is the second time it has happened in as many months after viewing the basement and noise level we took the offer of a different room in this room we were met with a very stale damp smell and an horrifically big brown damp patch outside the bathroom the hairdryer didn t work although the receptionist did provide us with a temporary one in the morning i awoke to a dripping noise in the toilet for several minutes i though it was the toilet itself however on further investigation i found the water to be dripping through the light fitting from the shower room above i informed the receptionist and we were again provided with another room this is all said with the added attraction of being a couple in the smallest rooms i have ever been in and to top it the hotel is presently in the middle of a building site
