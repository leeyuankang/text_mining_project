i was told i was getting a free upgrade but the room was tiny i can only imagine what my standard room would have looked like they make you hand in your room key every time you go out and also the main door can only be opened by receptionist in and out so when i was standing there waiting for it to be opened it was freezing that night when i left at the next morning the night guy wasnt there and i couldnt open the door my taxi was outside waiting to take me to airport i was shouting hello to try to find someone when they turned up i just wanted out i d already gave them credit card for charges so they could charge anything from mini bar but he said no we d need to do it now i was locked in so no choice i had only one small bottle of evian for which he said was euros i didn t have time to ask or argue just paid so i could get out the toilet was a sperate small room from the shower sink so not good for washing hands the safe didnt work
