room sizes were on the smaller size however it s a city centre hotel so that is to be expected one thing that we didn t particularly like however is that the pictures show when booking are of the top floor rooms so we booked under the assumption that the rooms would be bigger than they were and also have a nice bath tub however this wasn t the case what they gave us wasn t bad it just wasn t what we were expecting also by booking through booking com we were supposed to have late check out at on the final day as part of being a member of the website however we started getting calls at saying we had to check out i reminded the reception staff that we had late check out through our booking and he said that s dependent on availability which i thought they could have mentioned from the beginning
