the hotel is on an extremely busy road and even with the double glazing the noise was unbearable i had to sleep with ear plugs the extra large bed is actually two singles pushed together so you can feel the split down the middle when you are sleeping the deluxe room seems outdated and not as deluxe as i would have hoped the wifi is really slow there were no toiletries on the second day of my stay so i had to request them from the front desk
