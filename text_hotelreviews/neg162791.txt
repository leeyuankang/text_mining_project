the worst room i ve ever had in paris dirty tiles in bathroom were falling off bugs in the tub water damage on the ceiling and outside our room dirty walls absolutely gross and overpriced the staff was rude and downright mean i would never stay here again and advise everyone to steer clear of this tourist trap i come to paris multiple times a year there are so many wonderful hotels for the same price point where the staff is actually lovely and helpful avoid at all costs do not eat the breakfast just gross all around
