we checked in to westside on the evening the lady who checked us in was professional and courteous the lady in the morning every day was also very professional and courteous but there was a gentleman we dealt with in the evening every time who was eternally grumpy and seemed to react like we were an interruption to what he was doing the hotel rooms were very small for a star hotel and not what we expected the breakfast was one table with bread and croissants and few other knick knacks you would definitely expect more from a star hotel on our second day we ordered room service and i ordered lentil soup lebanese platter and french fries we waited for more than minutes and after multiple follow ups i got lentil soup a plate of cheese and no french fries i did not have dinner that night apparently this hotel does not have room service in house they just order from a nearby restaurant and so there is a lot lost in translation my sister s family who were staying with us could not get water delivered either overall it was a very disappointing stay especially after travelling through italy switzerland and getting some amazing service from similar sized and similar category hotels as mentioned the plus points were the location and the friendly lady receptionists who were professional and courteous the remaining staff were quite unfriendly and we felt quite unwelcome including the ladies at the breakfast who were very curt i provide this feedback as a constructive feedback so the hotel can view the service from the perspective of the recipient of such services and look at ways to enhance the same
