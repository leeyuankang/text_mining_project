the whole hotel had an awful smell when you walked in the mini lobby smells like vinegar the old carpets smell bad and our room smelled like puke mixed with baby wipe products the bed was supposed to be for people but i think they measure them for midgets not normal average humans the washroom was so tight when you sit on the toilet you face a wall and your knees touch it the rooms are so tight to each other that you hear everything including the hour sex sessions of your neighbours we also woke up to a fire alarm and people who close their doors next to us wake us up since the walls were paper thin and super close to one another definetly not a star hotel but if you have no other choice in terms of money the area is safe because it s all rich families and old people
