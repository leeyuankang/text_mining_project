very uncomfortable rooms we were upgraded to a room on the floor that was pathetic there was no lift to the eight floor we were expected to carry suitcases up a flight of stairs requested another room and was given one on the second floor this was much better than the upgraded room but this was never cleaned properly no towels replaced and trays from room services never collected definitely not recommend if you travelling with children
