if it wasn t considered a hotel i wouldn t write perhaps the following points rooms very tiny nothing to say about the bathroom decrepit facilities although the lobby seems quite fresh quite poor breakfast rooms not soundproof from neighboring ones not able to prepare the breakfast to go even if asked a day in advance so i would rather consider it a good hotel but then pay attention at the price and i know it s paris and that s the case with most of the hotels but that should not be an excuse for ranking it properly
