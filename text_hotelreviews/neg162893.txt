i requested via booking com to do an early check in since my flight arrives at and i will do an early check out in return got positive response from hotel stating that it is fine but subject to availability of the room when i arrived they refused to let me check in saying that i should have booked an extra night i told them that i was informed via booking com that it will be ok to early check in but they only let me check in at staying hours in the lobby after a hours flight after that they tried to play another game by saying that the breakfast is not included i insisted that i paid extra for the breakfast through booking com and they said no you will be charged if you take the breakfast i showed them the detailed invoice in my email and then they accepted to let me have the breakfast that was a very unprofessional dealing with their staff and definitely i will never visit their hotel neither recommend it to anyone and that was my first time to have such a bad experience in paris
