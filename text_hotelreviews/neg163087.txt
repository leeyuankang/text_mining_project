the receptionist at the weekend was absolutely rude disrespectful to me and my guest it was my bday and friends came to congratulate me for a party if we were too loud he could have simply given a call and we had left instead he questioned me very rude the next morning and was also very disrespectful to my friends on sunday this guy is seriously not fitting the happy culture and makes a very bad impression despite the othr staff being so amazing breakfast was very small and simple there could be more choice the rooms were small but charming bathroom sink a lil unusual but all in all it works a minibar would have been nice
