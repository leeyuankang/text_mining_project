the stars of this hotel are too much the room was not large enough the towels were not well ranged some of them were hidden in the wardrobe and not in the bathroom the little glass was not enough large to prevent the shower water to spread out of the bathtub there was not a little fridge the wifi dialogue box was not user friendly and no more than one appliance at a time was allowed with a single e mail address so we could connect one computer or one smartphone at a time but not the two at the same time
