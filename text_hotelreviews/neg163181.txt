hotel offers an express breakfast for euros but confines this to one tea or coffee and two small pastries we had fresh fruit and orange juice as well classic continental style breakfast but were charged as if we had had full breakfast made the value for money aspect far more questionable when overall the hotel offers great value air conditioning was centrally controlled and on a very hot night not quite as effective as one could wish we did mention this to reception but no change was made these two negatives did not outweigh the positives
