we stayed in a superior room which was for people however i don t feel it was big enough we managed but there was a lot of squeezing past each other and no space to put anything really other than on the beds i think the photos are a little deceiving also at the time of booking i was told i would pay on arrial which although did happen the hotel put a pre authorisation for the full amount of the room days before we arrived this does impact on your available funds in your bank so is pretty much like the payment has been taken i queried this with hotel but nothing was done theresfore i was less in my bank account for the days before arriving at the hotel this was dissapointing as i was not told this at booking despite me specifically asking the question about payment also the booking site does not state you have to give a security deposit when checking in
