when we returned a few days later without our adult children we were told that we would be getting a very nice room when we arrived our room had been changed it was very cramped pushed up against the wall so you had to climb over your husband to go to the toilet at night also no lift i had to struggle up all the stairs to the room with the luggage bathroom was very small with no shelf to put your toiletries wouldn t bother with breakfast next time
