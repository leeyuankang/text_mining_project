i stayed at this hotel with my partner and was extremely unhappy when at am we were woken to the male receptionist screaming to some young girls to get out of his hotel this is extremely unacceptable to wake other guests up shouting the main reason you stay in a hotel is to sleep not be woken up if the screaming wasn t bad enough at there was a frantic knock at the door it was the male receptionist accusing my boyfriend of having the girls in the room and demanded to see who he was with i think this was very unacceptable when i spoke to the female receptionist in the morning about this nothing was done hardly even an apology
