wifi not working at all in the rooms we had to go to the lobby counter to access the free wifi when we arrived at the place we couldnt use both rooms we booked because there was problem with the electrical connections in the room however hrs later which was one of our room was ready and the other was not so all of us had to cramp in the room meant for ppl when they told us that the room will not be ready until we decided to go out when we came back at pm the other room was finally ready but sadly none of the sockets in the room was working i asked both the staff guy and lady whether we will be compensated for our sufferings they told me that they will have to ask the manager on duty the next day however the next day we were told that they were not able to give compensation then and will contact me again on the compensation issue however i have yet to hear from them till date the premise was near to manor house station but the walk there from the accommodation is uphill which is not very convenient when youre bringing lots of big heavy bags
