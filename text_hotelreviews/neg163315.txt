found the following issues with a compact double room bathroom was shared it was not mentioned in the room title as most other hotels do much clearer but only with a short sentence in the room description easy to overlook also because two photos on the four available in the room description were related to a bathroom although then the room contains none the staff was clearly aware of the possible issue as this is the first thing they reminded me immediately after having charged me with the price of our stay proposing also an expensive upgrade to a room without shared bathroom bad smell in the room room with a window on a trafficked road one must choose between fresh air or silence to sleep no kitchnette and no microwave but such facilities now seem to have been removed from the description of that room no refrigerator tea coffee making facilities the kettle had a so short electric cable that it could not lay on the table or on the floor ridiculous but it was even not working hopefully it was changed with a brand new one but only after having requested it cutlery and crockery were not present at first we received them only on the third day on four for our whole stay still after having requested them but it was then removed and didn t reappear on the fourth day on the hotel website a toaster ironing facilities and a hair dryer are also supposed to be present in such rooms not present either a complimentary water bottle on arrival was supposed to be provided we ve never heard of it free wifi it was so weak and instable in that room that navigating web pages was really frustrating waiting time and streaming anything audio or video nearly impossible flat screen tv oriented toward the ceiling which is not exactly the best for a good vision i don t understand how this hotel can be part of the booking com s preferred property programme
