well i had booked for a classic double room which had wa kitchnette like a studio all in the room and the pictures were lovely when i booked however when i reached there the room i was showed was in the basement one with a compact double room and the separate kitchen area and an extremely small bathroom i refused to be in that room stating that this was not what i had booked i insisted and showed the lady the pictures of the supposed classic double room and she told me that this is a superior double studio which is normally for persons i insisted on having that room which i got room it was nice cozy but with a double bed so i wondered how come persons and the room was not as big as well but nice with clean bathroom as well to my surprise i was then told that i will charged extra as this is not the room type i booked even if the pics were those on the website i stayed for nights and while check out i was not told anything about the extra charge i assumed they had figured out their mistake of misleading pics and hence not ch oarged but to my surprise in the evening while checking my credit card balance they had charged me an extra almost pounds i had already paid pounds for that room so yes it was a nice place little noisy but good but misleading really dissapointed for having paid so much extra when i had booked that room only so do make sure you have the price and the room in the pics before booking guys
