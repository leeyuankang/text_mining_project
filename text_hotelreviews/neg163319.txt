the studio was incredibly small for people the bed for the person was a sofa bed really uncomfortable and it was beside the wardrobe that couldn t be opened due to the lack of space the table just had two chairs because there was no space for a third one even if we booked for guests we couldn t wide open the window thus making the studio even more claustrophobic one day when we came back we found the door of our studio open probably left like that after the daily cleaning
