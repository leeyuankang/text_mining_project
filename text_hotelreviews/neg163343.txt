main road only parking close by was per hour had to park miles away at a park and ride and get a taxi to and from car later told by general manager that he had parking we could have used would have been great if that info was available to us on check in before we wasted hours and single glazed windows very noisy and difficult to regulate temperature shower is a shower tap needed some tlc as it leaked from the tap and spayed water all over the floor after a change in who was staying i requested a change to a twin room from a double and paid extra to get a family room this consisted of a double bed and a couch bed we ended up sharing the double bed anyway as the couch bed kept tipping over when he turned in his sleep result was no sleep and despite having booked for two nights we checked out in the morning unable to stay another night we were offered a discount on our next stay but no refund so about spent on night of no sleep plus the parking and taxis should have just spent the on a room at a chain hotel in short a really expensive mistake
