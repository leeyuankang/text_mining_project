the hotel is awful it is not a hotel actually its only a villa with some rooms divided inside and they are very very small no telephone inside no restaurants too much noisy they don t have elevator the stairs are scary too much light in the rooms the curtains very old they wanted to charge me for each hour late my last day and the guest relation executive was very rude i have asked for the general manager they said that they don t have any general manager i was really chocked anyways what i suggest is to remove hotel from the website and just say it is furnished small apartment this would be better and remove those fake pictures on their website because this is not true at all the rooms are not the same of the one on the website this is a shame to betray people
