avoid room because of the noisy reception during the day it s ok but i was woken up at by the noisy people on reception chatting very loudly in the corridor why there are two people on reception at that time i don t know but could they not chat in their reception room maintain some quiet in the corridors to be woken up by noisy staff at such an early hour is a bit of a let down
