attitude of staff we awoke during the night to find water coming through the roof and the bathroom flooded we were moved to another room which was worse than the room we had moved from windows and curtains couldn t be opened in the new room as it was a ground floor room and people were sitting on the other side of the glass eating the air conditioning didn t work in any of the rooms so not being able to open the windows was an issue and we had not paid a lot of money for a room where you couldn t even open the curtains we asked for another room for the rest of our stay we could see from the website they weren t fully booked and the staff one person was incredibly rude a shame the customer service does not live upto the lovely building and location
