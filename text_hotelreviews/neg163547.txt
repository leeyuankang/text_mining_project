the hotel is the most poor my managed hotel i ve ever seen in my life it was shocking how little communication they have with each other not only between each department but also in the same department as well first off all the hotel cancelled my reservation without any prior notice she was rude and when she finally got put in her place she magically found my reservation i also had booked spa appointments and when i came to cancel one the late at the spa made it out to seem like she was doing me a favor by allowing to cancel my own reservation even though i was paying full price for the cancellation she continually kept calling my room even though i had told her i was sleeping repeatedly but she kept trying to make me come down from my room so i can sign the bill of my cancelled appointment as if it could wait all hype and no substance
