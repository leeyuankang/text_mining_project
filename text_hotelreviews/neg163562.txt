rooms are rather small the medium sized room we booked would be the minimum for most western travellers for a star hotel techy rooms are nice but panels lighting up at night without noticable reason might disturb some whilst getting to sleep staff was very friendly and helpful but seemed overwhelmed in some situations all in all it is tiny issues that separate this hotel from a true luxury hotel
