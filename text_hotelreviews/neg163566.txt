the room description was totally misleading the room was tiny barely at a squeeze was there room to get around the bed and no other space at all in the room not even space to put a suitcase the wardrobe and cupboards were pathetic in space and layout there was no complementary tea in the room and ordering using the mind boiling i pad system was just ridiculously complicated and with no way of knowing if you order had gone through eventually resorted to using the telephone when the tea tray arrived there was not even a table or place to put it other than using the bed a real disappointment and very misleading especially for the price
