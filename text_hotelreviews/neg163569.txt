because we came at a strange time of year april so spring into summer the hotel which aims to be fully eco had not transferred into summer ops yet this meant we couldn t use the aircon unit in the room to regulate the temperature nor open a window and ended up feeling quite hot as a result especially after a shower but since we weren t spending our days indoors this was a minor inconvenience
