i was extremley disappointed with the members of staff who had not lived up to the grandure of this exquisite building it started from the moment when my partner and i walked in from the reaction of the staff member who supposedly greeted us felt a vibe instantly and that we did not fit the profile of the cliental that he is acustom to he then proceeded to ask regarding the settllement of the bill astonished by this question asked more or less straight away whether i would be using the card which the room was prebooked with i will not use names but this member of staff is aware of who he is and that his conduct was appalling it could of possibly ruined my celebrations he stated that another member of staff will come up to the appartment and demonstrate how to use the gadgets in the room with in the next minutes we had allowed minutes to pass as we getting ready for dinner reservations it resulted to my partner going back down to reception to be told that it was change over and there is no one to assist as they were busy someone will show us when we returned back to the hotel my partner who clearly pointed out that this was not feasible as we would be coming back the early hours of the morning wished not to be disturbed to be shown at that time the functions returned back to the hotel whereby a member of staff gave a brief outline how to use the tv i had asked is there anything else to be made aware off response no it was not mentioned regarding the phone benefits that i read up on their site as a feature not described or even spoken off with making free calls locally and selected international lines advised just dial for outside line if required reception i had hoped that the ordeal would have stopped but it continued to the point of the breakfast order could not be physically taken down by the member of night staff jwho referrred to just update on the ipad
