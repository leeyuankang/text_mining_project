i must say that i had very high expectations about this hotel and this stay was one of my most disappointing accommodation experiences most king rooms are so small you can not even open your suitcase properly it is impossible to open a window without calling someone from maintenance or even to prepare your own cup of tea for some reason you need to use an ipad located in the room to have them prepare one and bring it to you also they have different size rooms for the exact same price of the same room type so when you book try to ask for the larger rooms if you need some space front desk manager was only kind upon my leaving and in general it felt like almost everything that could have gone wrong went wrong for such a techy hotel i found the fact that there were no indicators on the shower faucets very odd as well since there were of them and it was a riddle to figure out how to get hot water for a shower i ve stayed in less fancy much better and friendlier hotels in this area
