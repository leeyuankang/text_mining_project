i paid for breakfast for myself and my boyfriend but because i was running the marathon we were given a runners breakfast this turned out to be a sandwich i asked for toast because realistically runners don t eat ham and cheese sandwiches before a race a banana and coffee no water despite asking a bit miffed that it cost me so much i could have brought all of that from home
