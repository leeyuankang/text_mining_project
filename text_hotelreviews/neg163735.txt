duplex has quirky layout tried to be a high end boutique hotel but didn t quite work example bathroom very nice but sink so tight to the wall that when i brushed my teeth i almost banged my head on the mirror when i went to rinse kitchen tap is set so low and sink so small it s hard to get a cup or glass under there to fill with water also plumbing problems with room above resulted in water coming in through our roof for of days when their shower was in use staff gave us a reduced rate for the inconvenience so satisfactory outcome
