read the small print normally when you book a hotel there are certain facilities this isn t really a hotel as we know it there is no bar no restaurant etc if you want breakfast its delivered to your room as there is nowhere to eat we arrived at the hotel and after checking in we were brought back to the front door and the girl pointed down the street and said your room is in that building not my usual hotel experience if you are into caravans then you would recognise the space saving features that the room entails we really did not like the toilet that had a sliding glass door in such a small room as we could not just run back down to a reception on leaving the hotel we called to the main hotel and asked reception if they had given us the best room they could have it got really awkward as the receptionist got quite defensive she went and got the manager and he was the same challenging us both the receptionist and manager became quite rude i would not visit again or recommend this hotel
