this is not a hotel i repeat this is not a hotel i had to walk several houses down the road to get to the property it should be advertise as a guest house not a hotel so you would hardly keep walking back to get a tea or coffee i call this false advertisement every time someone walk across the room above the noise was loud really frustrating this is not what i paid for
