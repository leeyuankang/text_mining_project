this hotel is one of those london hotels which has a second building which is where i stayed my building didn t have a lobby with free coffee cookies etc the other thing is that there are a lot of stairs involved in this hotel both getting to the room and inside my duplex it was very architecturally interesting but maybe not for older people while the room had ample rooms and facilities the feeling of the decor was a step below ikea
