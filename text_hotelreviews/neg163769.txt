the ad about parking on booking com was misleading it states that parking is available but there is no parking i had to use a public car park not close to the hotel at a very high daily rate one of the windows in the room had no curtain which meant that the walk from the bed to the bathroom was overlooked by a residential neighbour sitting on his balcony only a few yards away i think he got more of a view than he bargained for
