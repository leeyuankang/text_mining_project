at first i have booked a studio room however it was really nothing to breath inside and conditioner was broken i was told that all rooms are the same however i was offer to switch to another one which was a higher category and to pay extra pounds per night i accepted it cause studio room is so uncomfortable and tiny my room was and until pm it is easy to hear what other people downstairs are talking about and the sound from bathroom from the closet room was pretty loud
