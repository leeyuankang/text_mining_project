me and my friend booked a double room with two single beds the hotel informed us weeks before our arrival that we have been upgraded the room was in another building across the street nottingham place no as all rooms bookable at the moment the whole interior of this building looked as if it is still under construction in the rooms no carpets as indicated on the homepage wall paint on the floors and our second bed turned out to be the sofa with the linen hidden in the coffee table unfortunately also really dark due to the small courtyard but at least we managed to escape the cellar room they offered us first so we did not really had the feeling of being upgraded everything else was fine
