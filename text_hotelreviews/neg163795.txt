i didn t like the idea of paying for a room which was not even in the hotel but another apartment accross the road in what i would imagine would have been a bedroom was turn into a bath area toiltet area kitchen area bed was very uncomfortable had my pillows keep falling off the bed because it had no headboard or against the wall lots of raised area supposed to make space but had to walk sideways to get to the bed i hated the room and for the amount i paid for
