we didn t get what we booked the so called kitchenette consisted of a kettle microwave in a space no bigger than a small cupboard the bath shower was very dangerous you had to step down and in at the same time while hanging onto a hand rail the room was very small made worse by the steps at the end of the bed to the already small floor space you had to pack and unpack on the bed not enough room beside it
