our room had lots of large stains on the beige carpet looks like possible flood damage and really put us off the curtains and screens also could be done with a clean as they were all grey around the window ledges the hairdryer in the room is awful they have tea coffee facilities and nice toiletries so it made no sense why they would not give you a proper hairdryer rather than one of the white box things stuck to the wall
