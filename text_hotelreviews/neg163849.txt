the room was not located in the hotel itself it was down the road on the opposite site an after thought if you are claustrophobic then do not stay here the lights in the shower didn t work the shower head sprayed everywhere the hairdryer was a pin plug we are on england not europe the room in my opinion was an after thought to the hotel and a quick renovation for more rooms it was in my opinion not and executive room far too small and claustrophobic for my liking and will not be booking to stay there again even the paintwork needed refreshing and the was no artwork on the walls very basic
