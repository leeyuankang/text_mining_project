we booked a suite this second time twice the price to a studioroom and figured it should be even better but believe it or not it was worse the room was old and worn the carpeted floor was dirty stained and teard the shower was small and the showerhead had no water pressure at all it was like having someone peeing on your head from the ceiling the furnitures where old nagged and scratched and the wardrobe door was about to fall off any second we even found vermin disgusting even the walls were stained overall with i don t even wanna know what time for an update and a renovate for sure
