the stairway to the rooms were very tired the carpets seemed a tad grubby so my level of expectations were starting to slip there was an air conditioning unit it wasn t very powerful there was a separate stand alone fan which was used fully in an attempt to cool the room the tv remote was a bit of a mess with batteries on show an attempt to repair had been made by the hotel the carpet was very grubby frayed in places the duvet had what i can only describe as a blood stain or red wine stain either way not something i expect from any hotel let alone a hotel the bathroom had wires hanging out of the cosmetic mirror the shower was pointless no power in the spray the head wouldn t higher up the stay was ok we didn t come to london to stay in the room so it served its purpose but when booking a highly star rated hotel you have expectations which weren t met
