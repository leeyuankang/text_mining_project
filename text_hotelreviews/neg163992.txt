the first point that i didn t like is that when the hotel charged me by mistake they took the money twice when i called the person on the phone was extremely rude telling me that it was a bank holiday in france that this kind of things can never happen in this hotel and seemed to don t care about on the top of that while we were on the phone he spoke to his colleague telling him that the cake was in the fridge at the end he told me to call the following day to speak with his colleague who had been more helpful and understanding the second point which is for me extremely unprofessional is that when we checked out at by mistake we forgot in the safe around and my passport after hours we went back to take our luggages but they didn t let us know they found them we realised we didn t have them only when we arrived in the train station in any other case we could have missed our flight we called back the hotel and weren t still not sure if they found anything we had to go back and fortunately been given everything they should have let us know they found them at least when we came back for our luggages
