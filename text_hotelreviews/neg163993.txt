we were very disappointed by the staff and facilities one example was that the wifi constantly stopped working every ten minutes when i asked the staff about this they said it is always like this and we just have to accept it the overall attitude of the staff does not match the marketed image of this hotel we came down for breakfast a little after the staff said it starts at he begrudgingly let us in after i said to him that it was already past during check in they also ignored us while chatting took my credit card but didn t give us any price info we booked double occupancy rooms with only ppl yet they felt they had to interrogate us about how many ppl were in each room i also saw them ask the same to another group they seemed to be ppl in double rooms overall they only thing food about this place is the location but there are other hotels there too
