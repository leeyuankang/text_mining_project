the regular elevator was not working this was not informed on the website or thru booking com we have to use the service elevator which is a space for only one person also you have to give an extra mins waiting for this elevator this was a major hindrance the checkout person was annoying as he did not wish to work in the morning there is no bellboy to take your luggage as he did not arrive as per his schedule time it took mins to checkout with constant complaints about his work and then calling the taxi for the airport i recall his name was patrick
