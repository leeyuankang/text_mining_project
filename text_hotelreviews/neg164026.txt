i don t think we had the warmest welcome when we arrived but the rest of the time we were there we were made to feel at home by the staff there was one member of staff that worked the night shift that went out of his way to help us however disappointed with the hotel itself considering it was a star hotel i think there are probably better star hotels in paris also could hear the person in the room next door having an hour long telephone conversation late at night which kept us awake
