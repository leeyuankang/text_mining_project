our executive room was gloomy and brown with minimal natural light quite small for the extra cost it looked out onto concrete walls a slightly larger executive room was available but only on payment of a supplement and the view was the same breakfast could have been a treat but it was quite bland and served in an over crowded drab backroom also one lift wasn t operating for two days causing delays so we used the stairs a lot on reflection we i may have had unrealistic expectations for a room in central london however like many visitors to the capital staying here was meant to be part of a special occasion for an important anniversary overall the hotel was fine no real cause for concern just a little underwhelming
