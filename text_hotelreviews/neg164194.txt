i paid for to have my room upgraded to a air condition room and that was way over charged for what was at best very poor working system if it was working at all the room was always warm this hotel would be fine in the winter or during cool weather but if the weather was hot it would be very uncomfortable also for reason know only to the hotel the room bed had only a very heavy blanket on the bed with only the mattress sheeted so you only had one sheet not two as in most hotels
