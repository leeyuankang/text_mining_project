the lifts as others have mentioned were quite slow as one wasn t working our room felt quite small even though only of us were in there the bed was a bit hard and the bathroom was really small at one point the bathroom couldn t have been more than half a meter wide which meant we bumped ourselves constantly trying to get in or out of the shower there was also a huge amount of construction going on on our floor and outside the building it was extremely loud and would have been nice if we d been told to expect noise when we checked in
