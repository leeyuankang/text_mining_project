the breakfast choice was excellent however the pre made yellow bread crumbed hash browns were on offer as usual elsewhere sometimes baked fairly hard we stay in plenty of hotels in uk and abroad and on cruise ships and the modern way for offering potatoes nowadays seems to be saut ed sometimes with mushrooms or onions mixed in delicious we realise that some people do actually like the pre formed hash browns but perhaps the strand palace could provide both to appeal to all their customers not a complaint but a helpful suggestion
