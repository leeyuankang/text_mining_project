i had to change the date of our stay because i was unwell at the end of april when we should have been at the hotel when telephoned to change the booking i was told that our stay would cost an extra but that this would now include breakfast which we hadn t originally asked for as i currently have to take a fat free diet until i can have an operation this seemed ideal as i would be able to choose from the menu the things i could eat however when we booked in we were informed that this was not correct and breakfast was not included we could have paid extra for it but having been told that it was to be included decided that was enough to pay
