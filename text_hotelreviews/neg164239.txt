each year my wife and i have an annual trip to london for a show and site seeing in the past we have stopped at the trafalgar sq thistle and ramada edwardian this year we decided to stay at the strand palace which was a big mistake even though we paid significantly more than our previous trips our room was tiny and had no air conditioning there were hotel repairs going on by our window which required leaving lights on all night as we could not sleep we complained and were moved to another room at this room was even smaller we will not be returning
