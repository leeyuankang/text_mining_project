the palace is well worn very busy and holds hundreds of guests it needs updating with dingy corridors and dorm style room configuraitons it is typical london small rooms older furnishing like being in your grandparents house but be careful as they overcharge given the post code of the hotel but if you book late the rates drop significatly since its really not comparable to the savoy or other options
