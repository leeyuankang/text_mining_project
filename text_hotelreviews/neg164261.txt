my room wasn t sound proofed and the head of the bed was right up against the corridor wall i was woken up all through the night and early morning by guests walking and talking in the corridor through paper thin walls every time someone ran the shower or went to the toilet the water pipes made loud clanging sounds through the night there was no air conditioning in the room either and the room was so unbearably hot i hardly slept anyway
