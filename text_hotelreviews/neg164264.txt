confusion at breakfast we were seated in a room to side of main area where there was a cold buffet and very small selection of hot food it was only when we went in search of toast that we realised we could have accessed a much better selection this caused confusion for several residents and extra work for staff who dealt with the issues having stopped several times it s the first time we ve had this problem
