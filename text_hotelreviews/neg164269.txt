i have to stay here when work commands but i ve said it before and i will say it again booking com should remove this property it seems to me that if you book through booking com you get given the nastiest little company rooms always looking inwards onto piles of scaffolding anyone could climb into your room from there and there a bags of stuff sandwich wrappers bags of rubbish etc left by i presume workmen i d recommend you find somewhere else because the strand palace as far as using a booking engine like this is absolutely awful
