quite a lot unfortunately the difference between the reception area and the bedrooms is huge i would compare the rooms to that of a travel lodge nothing wrong with that apart from you re paying three times the price had my room changed twice as there was mould on the shower and lightbulbs hanging out of their cases the executive rooms aren t any nicer they re just bigger our view in all rooms was of a brick wall my partner and i went to the carvery restaurant on the saturday night we were kindly provided with some gluten free gravy but it was incredibly salty and unfortunately ruined the meal we informed the staff and they were disinterested then on the morning of check out which isn t until the maid came into our room at without giving us a chance to say that the room was occupied
