the concierge was the most grumpy rude and unhelpful person i have ever come across whilst staying at a hotel he was a young foreign guy and not like the traditionally informative and willing to help type of person you d expect the bed was incredibly uncomfortable too twin beds pushed together with no effort to disguise the lumps in the mattress where they met i hate that
