no fridge in room booked executive room which should have allowed us into covent garden dining room for breakfast where you order your food with extra choices available however we were shown into main restaurant and told to help ourselves to buffet breakfast i know the covent gdn dining was open but not doing ordered breakfasts i think we still should have been in there if only for the spaciousness and tables with lovely cloths etc the people who were allowed that privilege i can only think that their money must have been worth more than mine or maybe they thought we were hillbillies i have stayed in this hotel many times and thought i would treat ourselves to executive for second time but very disappointed eating arrangements
