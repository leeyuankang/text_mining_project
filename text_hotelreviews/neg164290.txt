i booked a cosy double room it was definitely cosy if not a little dated the room was overlooking a courtyard i think but that couldn t really be seen due to the scaffolding all outside the window which made the room really dark the windows wouldn t stay open making the room stifling hot but there was a desk fan and we used rolled up towels to prop the window open
