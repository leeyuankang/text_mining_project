on my second day at breakfast i was put into an inferior dining side room no table cloths no staff the man who put me there was very patronising called me darling twice obviously thought he could dump me as i was alone one of the reasons i go to this hotel in an executive room is s so i can use the executive dining room which i enjoy i did not take breakfast in the room he put me in
