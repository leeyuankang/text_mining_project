bed was lumpy and uncomfortable no aircondition in the rooms first room was on the floor and window could not be opened probably because of scaffolding and work being done outside we switched rooms second room was a few floors up but still not able to open the window facing the scaffolding therefore we woke up the next morning sweating buckets and no air to speak of window could not be opened we switched rooms for the third time there the window could be opened but unfortunately the bed was still lumpy the bar on the right was ok but please tell the staff to change the muzak and lower the volume and relax with the cold air blowing down on the guests no wonder very few guests hang out there it used to be very busy there all the time and what is the idea of keeping signs directing guests to an indian restaurant but only when standing in front of the door to the restaurant do you realize the restaurant is closed a sign on the door
