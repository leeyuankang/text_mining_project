on arrival we were told the room we had requested was unavailable and could not be provided for us as the hotel was overbooked after we complained the very helpful manageress sorted us out with a very adequate alternative annoyed however that booking com had offered the rooms online when obviously the hotel didn t actually have them we realise it can take time for the system to update but we had booked over hrs ahead the hotel is rather dated and in need of a facelift modernisation to ask the current tariff for a room
