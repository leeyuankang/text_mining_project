defects for maintenance room the left hand bed headboard light had a trapped wire hanging below the fitting and the connection to the shower electric towel rail had been taped up health and safety issues the only other point was when approaching our room on saturday afternoon we witnessed the housekeeping supervisor virtually shouting at a member of staff saying she was not doing her job properly and implying she could be dismissed when we said we wanted to go into our room the supervisor told us abruptly to return in minutes surely this matter should have been dealpt with behind closed doors not in front of guests i found our room on both friday and saturday excellent with beds correctly made one of the issues being shouted to the housekeeper by the supervisor other than this i found everything excellent and will definately stay here again next time we return to london
