i cannot remember having a smaller room or double bed ever in a london hotel also bed very hard and uncomfortable and this was supposed to have been an upgraded executive room i dread to think what the standard rooms were like i also think being asked for an extra to check into a room earlier than two and half hours when the room is already available is not good
