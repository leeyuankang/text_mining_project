how this hotel has the nerve to charge what it charges is beyond me perhaps the location is enough to con people into thinking it is lixury but believe me it is not our room was an internal room looking onwards towards a structure of scaffold and rubbish anybody could have climbed in through the window as ithat area is obviously accessible otherwise the scaffold or whatever it was wouldn t be there the room felt like a student halls room dark enclosed tires shabby and uncomfortable and had definitely seen better days it certainly seems that if you book with booking com you are punished by being given the worst possible rooms because i certainly hope this was a one off does hole room i would not recommend this hotel pay a bit more and shop around
