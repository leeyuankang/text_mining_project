location of the room and there was a waste line which was concealed behind a wall in the room so there was always the sound of a tap running water was generally a lot of noise around the room check clerk mixed up my name with another guest and allocated me to wrong room which had a later check out date that took forever to change asked for a late check out after a day stay and had to pay pounds per hour extra then got locked out after noon as the clerk ever extended the access to the room apologies with no consideration
