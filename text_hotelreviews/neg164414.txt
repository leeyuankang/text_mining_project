the rooms are not air conditioned so you re somewhat stuck with the unfashionable option of opening the window if you find the room too warm as we did when we arrived this also lets in the street noise the bathroom was perfectly functional but felt a little dated as is often the case with these larger places we found a large variation in the water temperature between morning and evening while it was not cold in the morning i couldn t get as hot a shower as my partner had managed the evening before therefore i would suggest if a hot rather than comfortably warm shower is your preference wash before you go to bed rather than after you get up in the morning we were unfortunately disturbed by a housekeeper at around we hadn t hung a do not disturb sign out as we had assumed that given it was our check out day and check out was at noon it was unlikely that the room would be attended early in big hotels this kind of thing sometimes happens but if you fancy a lie in it might be worth putting that sign out to ensure no one comes knocking
