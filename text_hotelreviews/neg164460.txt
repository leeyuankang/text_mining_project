very tacky outdated hotel located in the center of one of the most touristy areas in london the covent garden tube station is within walking distance however is the busiest in the city so beware not many other tube stations nearby which was somewhat of a hassle if you re looking for a more authentic low key london experience i wouldn t recommend staying here
