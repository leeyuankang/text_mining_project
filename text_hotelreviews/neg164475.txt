the room was awful i expected a lot from a star hotel but my room certainly wasn t star the bathroom was very worn with scratches in the sink and a shower which was very old and the plastic knob was broken and had a chunk of it missing and when you had a shower the bath would fill up with water so you couldn t be in there for to long the room just looked so worn and old the windows was very dirty and the view we had was dirty and disgusting all i wanted was to stay in a star hotel room but i would of been better of booking a star hotel just so i would of known what i was in for
