we have stayed here several times and this time enjoyed a room up grade service and cleanliness were fine as usual and the central location is ideal for visiting the only difficulties were the usual ones breakfast can mean either a wait to get into the dining area or a walk in crocodile formation round to the adjacent restaurant like most large hotels you won t get hot breakfast food unless you are very lucky as at best the food will be lukewarm
