we saw rooms during our stay and have to say the final rooms allocated were far from perfect in comparison to what we had already seen we were a family and ideally we were requesting rooms next to each other they found this combination however one room was absolutely tiny especially the bathroom with faulty faucet and the other room had a door that didn t close easily
