the rooms were old and dingy and the bed was so uncomfortable and kept moving resulting in me picking my pillows up from the back of the bed several times in the night the bathroom was awful and every time the tap was turned on and off it literally shook the bathroom the view from our room was old and battered walls overall not worth the money and i would not stay here again
