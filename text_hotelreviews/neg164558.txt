the hotel lobby and bar areas are very nice it s an old historic hotel the standard rooms are very basic and you the walls are thin it s a no frills sleeping room with no decor the bed linens were old and they didn t use a top sheet just a top comforter that we all know rarely gets washed i turned the lights on several times in the night to ensure there were no bedbugs the bathroom was outdated and very tight space i had to squeeze near the toilet before i could even shut the bathroom door to get to the sink i would never stay here again
