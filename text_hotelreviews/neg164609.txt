the staff were came across as literally there to do a job the whole building feels dated i went to my room after a late check in unpacked got ready for bed and then noticed the window was not locked and easily lifted open and there was an adjacent window that i considered accessible the room was also cold as there was no heating other than a small plug in radiator that was giving off a bad smell there was no forewarning of either issue and when i called to swap rooms and suffer the inconvenience of having to re pack and get dressed again this was not an option a suggestion of sending up a maintenance man was put to me but it had already gone hrs i was a lone female and there was no guarantee of when he would turn up so i hardly slept a wink and am still out of sorts as a result ever since will not be going back again
