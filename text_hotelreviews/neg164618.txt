we made a point of letting the hotel know at the time of booking we were celebrating my wife s birthday we asked when checking in if we had a room with some sort of view and were told no and we are not moving you were disappointed there was nothing in the room when we checked in but after after some lunch and a walk we arrived back to find a card and bottle of processco had been left thank you we would definitely book the strand palace again but would make sure we had a nicer room
