i would never stay here again we were not able to check in for several hours as the computers were down the lobby was cold and full of very unhappy guests it was january and the heating in the room did not work but the staff did not inform us of this upon check in we requested a room change but were told we could not because of the special booking price a tiny portable heater was provided which made no difference the duvets were paper thin more for summer than winter no chance we would ever be confortable in the cold dreary room we requested to cancel our booking so we could find a more suitable hotel the hotel said we must call booking com they said only the hotel could refund our money i offered a compromise and pay for one night of a two night booking the manager refused so we left the hotel with our bags on a cold rainy day and found a decent place to stay wasted they can keep my money i will keep my dignity
