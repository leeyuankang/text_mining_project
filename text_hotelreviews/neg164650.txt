the service in the resturant is poor we had to wait every morning in a que to be seated as not enough space and moved to a different resturant on one morning because of lack of space in the second resturant there was no white sugar on the table as all had been used we are tea drinkers and would not use brown sugar when i asked the waitress for whit sugar she informed me they had run out of it i couldn t believe my ears a hotel resturant running g out of white sugar eat in the morning she eventually went to another table and return with two packets of sugar the breakfast staff certainly could do with more training we had to request them to bring us tea any other hotel we ever stayed in the staff always came and asked if we need tea coffee and if everything was ok not here makes a difference to the guest even if the food wasn t great it makes one feel welcome and the guest then overlooks some shortcomings in a forgiving manner we pay for good service and we work hard to be able to travel and enjoy the staff in reception and especially the concierge steven was lovely and we had a good laugh with him
