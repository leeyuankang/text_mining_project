the room was dated and shabby as i work in the city the location although wonderful for theatre goers wasn t really an asset for me i found it very commercial and although the staff were friendly enough i found other guests totally miserable barely able to utter a good morning and funnily enough i haven t experienced that at other hotels in london i wouldn t stay here again not a nice feel the room service food was average presentation rubbish the poor man seemed overworked to say the least
