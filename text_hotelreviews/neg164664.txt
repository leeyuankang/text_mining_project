the hotel states star but service and facilities more star had booked executive double however the room was not good very dark and tiny window faced a wall and constant hum from hotels air con units the room next door had executive label whereas our room did not making me wonder if they had added a coffee maker to a standard double as hotel was full it did not match images of executive room i complained and was told no other executive doubles available and got the feeling that this was because i had booked via bookings com rather than hotel direct it took minutes to get an alternative room a standard not executive double which was better as faced front of hotel this confirmed my feelings about the executive double room they gave me being a re labelled standard room because they were full i then had to argue for a refund on difference in room price waiting to have it credited back and benefits of executive room booking all disappeared once i moved rooms no record of me on breakfast list tried to charge for newspaper and no discount which was supposed to be applied on food drink in hotel
