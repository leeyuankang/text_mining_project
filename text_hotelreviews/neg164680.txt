the extract fan in the bathroom was ineffective causing the water to condense on the walls then run down creating a large pool on the floor thereby causing a slip hazard the view was of a dark internal courtyard overlooking the loud air conditioning units the queue to check in was too slow it took minutes before being served only to be told my room wasn t ready and to return later to collect my key even though it was nearly i went for breakfast to be told by a staff member the restaurant was full and i should go to the other one i then spotted a colleague in the same restaurant and entered only to find the restaurant over half empty and not full at all
