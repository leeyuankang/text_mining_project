the room was freezing cold and very noisy in the morning i actually thought someone was either trying to break in or in my wardrobe as the noise which turned out to be coming from next door using their wardrobe was so loud the room was small and ok bathroom a bit shabby and not as clean as i would like the duvet was wafer thin as were the pillows
