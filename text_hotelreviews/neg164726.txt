the room was nothing like the advert that enticed me to go ahead and book not sure how it could be charged or called an executive room we would have expected chairs not taking turns to sit on the one available which was really uncomfortable the room was drab again nothing like your advert it was not worth the money at all we would not like to have seen a standard room if this was the quality of executive the window casement was broken and so the top part of the window kept slipping down safety sign a bit ironic really we would not recommend these rooms to anyone who is planning to spend any time in the hotel better off sitting in the foyer
