the room was very masculine the tap was lose and the glass in the bathroom had mouldy in the bottom for the price the quality was poor but maybe you had to pay more because of the location the drilling outside till was awful but not the hotels fault but the early morning hoovering after the late night was very disturbing i guess they cleaners had to do their job but not slit if sleep for this pricy room
