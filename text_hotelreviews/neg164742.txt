for a star hotel it worthed as or stars and was very outdated the room i got was old and smelly old heating almost no amenities not even a glass to drink water the bath was full of black spots in the joints the guy in the concierge desk throwed me a magazine with a map without a word when i asked for a map really rude no worth the money at all i would not recommend it unless you only care about the location
