for the price i have had better breakfasts not that it was bad but i have had better and for the price i feel it should have been really the coffee was hot black but completely tasteless the window of the room was boarded with shutters at the sides and only the centre section would open which was a bit prison like the bathroom extractor did not work and the quilt was a bit on the small side only just fitting the bed overall it was all ok as a star hotel not a as advertised and for the price it was not really up to it
