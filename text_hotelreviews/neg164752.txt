the only two negatives i have for the hotel is that there was a lack of storage space for clothing and this was for a day trip it s definitely not suitable for a long stay as there is nowhere to put more than a few days worth of clothes secondly this gripe wasn t with the hotel but the room service we ordered two desserts and a cheese board on our last night usual rooms service prices overpriced the ice cream while not made in the hotel was fine the cheesecake was acceptable but not the quality you d expect and also came with strawberries not the stated raspberries small thing but we re allergic to strawberries but the issue really was with the cheeseboard it came with none of the accompaniments it was supposed to come with chutney quince jelly and cracker it was only the cheese that was delivered we called twice and asked for the missing items but they were never delivered to our room
