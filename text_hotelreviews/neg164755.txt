it s right on the main street and very loud late into the morning hours which kept me up traffic is terrible so don t plan on taking transportation everything should be done by foot or walk to the nearest subway if your luggage isn t heavy that shouldn t be a problem the rooms are outdated and quite small bed isn t very comfortable and the shower is a step up which i imagine would be too short for a taller person i m not sure how this is a four star hotel it seemed like almost a college dorm room i was renting
