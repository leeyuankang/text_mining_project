room was poor i asked to move and was told they were full noisy i could hear the conversation going on in the next room when the tv was turned down i had previously asked reception to request they turn their tv down but soon realised it was not because it was loud it was because the wall was paper thin room was very basic and of a lesser quality than a premier inn totally overpriced
