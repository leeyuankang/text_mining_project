we found the bacon at breakfast to be dry and the scrambled egg a little on the sloppy side unfortunatly the fried eggs had a snotty substance on top which was a little off putting maybe breakfast would taste better if prepared fresh rather than as a buffet for the price we payed it was disappointing
