the star rating is not deserved by this hotel the staff doesn t pay attention to the guests or does it as a great favor rather than their jobs your arrival at the hotel starts with you carrying your suitcases up the welcome stairs while the concierges and other staff attending the valet parking and desks my room had a window into the internal ventilation non garden with fans producing constant noise luckily i was staying in this hotel in september as i don t think it is survivable in summer due to lack of a c furniture and bathroom are weared off to the level of a star motel oh and remember to take flip flops when you are going to the shower chances are the floor will have a nice big puddle when you finish
