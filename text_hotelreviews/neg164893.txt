we where really disappointed with the bedroom we had it was a treat night away we got given a queen bed that was made up of single beds and was really uncomfortable with the gap in the middle when your time like ours is so precious you just want it to be perfect but i feel strongly that if your offering queen beds that is what they should be i would of rather had a double bed which would of made our experience staying there more pleasurable i feel the location for what we need was very good the buffett breakfast was very good too
