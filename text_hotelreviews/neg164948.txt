i had unfortunately used booking com and made a slight error when i called the hotel one member of staff said i would definitely need to contact booking com again i tried but could not get a response from them so i called the hotel again and another member of staff told me she could make the amendment after all i was grateful that the second member of staff knew what she was doing next time i shall book directly with the hotel as they give you incentives when you book through them
