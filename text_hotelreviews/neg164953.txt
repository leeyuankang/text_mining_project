the place is overpriced for the type of room you get if you are single you are better off in a hostel you will get a better accommodation there the rooms have no air conditioning and are closed off from air making it very hot in the rooms and uncomfortable the beds are saggy and are worse than some hostels not what i would expect from a so called or star hotel i would avoid this place
