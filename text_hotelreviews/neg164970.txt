the room was absolutely airless to the point of stifling although i had an extre night booked i decided to leave one night early as i couldn t stand another night of roasting in hell i had a single room one night facing a wall so changed to a double not much bigger still facing a wall and like an oven also they were very unbending about changing one night s accommodation for me to another although in money terms it wouldn t have changed anything for them and the room was available it would have made another loyal customer for them it is not great to shoot themselves in the foot by some silly rules that can be adjusted in special circumstances every customer counts and word of mouth is still the best or worst advert the hotel is called grand but in fact it is a very tired hotel and needs an update badly i would be spending my money somewhere else in the future
