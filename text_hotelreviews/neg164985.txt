this older property only has air conditioning in the lobby so in summer and warmer days of spring you ll be using the provided oscillating fan and an open window to cool off there is a heating radiator for winter i think my son was a little disappointed that the rooms were rather spartan compared to the sparkling lobby but a hotel should never be the reason for your travel
