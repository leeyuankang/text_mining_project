it was much too hot in the room which was on the second floor with the window open there was something industrial pumping out noise and heat all night just under the window so sleep was impossible there was no air conditioning and when i inquired having booked a single room i was told that there was only air conditioning in double rooms and i should have booked that this was not made apparent when i booked online and also would have meant a significant cost increase in an already expensive hotel also they charged for ice the ice machine on the floor cost for a small tub of ice i have never stayed in a hotel which charged for ice from the ice machine
