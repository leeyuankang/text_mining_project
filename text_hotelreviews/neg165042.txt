can not understand why when i booked over the internet that i was quoted per head for breakfast which i was willing to pay for four breakfasts on my visa card and when i got to the hotel and said i would like to pay hotel and breakfast in cash instead of my visa card breakfast dropped straight away to per head also i booked an early arrival booking lunch time nothing was mentioned about the extra fee i had to pay until i arrived at the hotel i think you should give better details to those hotel sites internet you have your details on i will stay again at your hotel but will certainly not include breakfast until i arrive and pay cash for them at per head cheaper mx
