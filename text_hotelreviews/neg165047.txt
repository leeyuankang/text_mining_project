the staff were not helpful upon arrival when my year old son and i arrived to find we were sharing a small bed together after booking online i realise this might have been my fault although i thought i had booked x single beds they were not helpful in resolving this smoothly and quickly instead focast on charging an extra to gbp we were not impressed and in my years of travel have never experienced this normally if there are issues on arrival the staff are more than happy to accomodate and move people to assist with their requests this was certainly not the case
