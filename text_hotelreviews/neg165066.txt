on arrival we were met with a queue of people all being told their rooms were not read this was at the designated time for booking in and that there would be a wait of no more than hour hours later i again approached he reception desk only to be told that my room was still not ready i was not happy with this and after a discussion with the reception manager another room was found for me and my husband we are both pensioners and had already had a hour journey into london what we didn t need was this delay without even an offer of a cup of tea coffee whilst we waited not a good start especially for a hotel of this standing
