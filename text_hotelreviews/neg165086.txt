although the bathroom was clean it was fairly dated for a star hotel the bath enamel had a black chip which didn t look great the basin and shower tap were quite old so had lost it shine and you could see the soap residue on them the tv in the room cold be a bit bigger as my daughter is blind in one eye and bad vision in the other so she couldn t see the screen from sitting on the bed and a long day
