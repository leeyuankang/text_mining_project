this was my second stay at the strand after checking in this time i notified reception that there was a very musty smell coming from the bathroom and requested i needed help with this that the room window be opened i kept it open to combat the mustiness which never left i probably should have requested a different room as along with hay fever issues the mustiness led to a lot of chest congestion and coughing now back home for a day am much better
