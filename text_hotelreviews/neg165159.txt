the rooms are a little on the small side and very basic furnished in a similar style and standard to a budget motel the biggest negative is that the rooms do not have air conditioning you have to rely upon a cooling fan that can be found in the bottom of the wardrobe if arriving by car you have to plan your arrival with military precision as there are no parking facilities and no drop off point at the front of the hotel
