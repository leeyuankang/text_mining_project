breakfast was uninspring no decent bakery only cooked food and cereals we had a conference and the rooms are all downstairs with no windows and very poor lighting the food for lunch was totally inappropriate pies and chips and minimal salad something fresh and lighter would have been much better i noticed there was a lot of food left over
