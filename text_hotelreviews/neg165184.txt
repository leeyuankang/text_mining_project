on arrival we had to wait over an hour after the check in time for our room as it was not ready we were given a soft hot drink when we did finally get into our room whilst unpacking and getting refreshed to go out as we were by now running late another hotel guest managed to access our room with their allocated room card this was brought to the attention of the reception who blocked our card and were looking into how this happened
