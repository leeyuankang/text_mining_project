for a star hotel in such a great location they should be ashamed it could be something special and probably was at one time looked dirty or perhaps tired and dated would be better words think s most of the staff could not care less but some were very nice food not good at all had better meals at the premier inn could not get the heating to work rang for assistance and neither could the maintenance guy on check in we were charged extra an extra to take the room earlier then allocated a tiny room although we had paid extra for a larger executive double room when i spoke to reception i was told that we had been allocated the correct room eventually but only after being very insistant they admitted they had made a mistake with our room and give me the keys to the executive double we had ordered the new room was unmistakable because of the big brass plaque on the door which said incredibly executive double what a scam if we had said nothing about the room they could have resold our room as an upgrade or similar wont be booking again to stay at the stand palace shame because it could be a great hotel
