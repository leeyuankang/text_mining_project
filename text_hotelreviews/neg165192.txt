no real welcome or warmth from the staff who all seemed harrassed and overworked discovering a dirty quilt cover at bedtime was unforgiveable had to wait for housekeeping to come and change it the bar service was very poor after being ignored for almost minutes had to ask to be served breakfast service was worse even in executive dining they use some kind of wipe clean cloth almost like plastic which was so wet when we sat down that we had to use the paper napkins to dry it the breakfast service was extremly slow and the quality was not good dried up bacon undercooked egg cold beans and tea that was so weak it struggled to crawl out of the pot unaided not worth the money
