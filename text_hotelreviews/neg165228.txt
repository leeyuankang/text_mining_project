we used the restaurant before our night out and was going to use the deal card from our room door to have the carvery i can t have alcohol and asked if i was able to have a soft drink with it instead of the ale or wine and was told no i do feel that that should be changed not everyone can have or want alcohol so also it would of been nice to have a bath mat when stepping out of the shower bath as it could be slippery and you don t really want to put your towel on the floor
