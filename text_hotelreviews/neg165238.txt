the only faults i could find with the hotel are the windows being locked in the rooms which made it difficult to get fresh air and the bath tubs were too small i m only ft and i couldn t fit which was a shame as i wanted to relax from the long journey and before going out for the night just to note my boyfriend and i were woken up the morning by a cleaner coming in the room without knocking she soon realised we were still in there and left so make sure you leave a don t disturb sign on your door
