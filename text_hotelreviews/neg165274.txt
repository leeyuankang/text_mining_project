i was not impressed with the concierge services after being sold tour tickets and advised that it was cheaper to buy at the hotel i learned otherwise additionally i was never advised to purchase audio tours and found that i had to do this independently each and every time i was not given steady advice for using the tube or bus system and often found that my own research faired better than what was offered the concierge also did not seem as informed about the restaurants in the area
