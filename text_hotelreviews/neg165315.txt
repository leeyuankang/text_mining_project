i specifically requested a non main street facing room yet was allocated room which is so noisy it is akin to sleeping outside in the street i had two nights very bad and constantly broken sleep in my opinion this hotel should not even charge for this room as it is unfit for purpose as i doubt anybody could get a good nights sleep given how noisy this room is
