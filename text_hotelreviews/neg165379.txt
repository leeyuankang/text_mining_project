the executive room was poor and definitely not value for money our room was inward facing basically it s outlook was other rooms in the square not what you d expect for the nightly price of the bed was small and there was no choice of pillows they were all hard and did not mould to accommodate your head the bathroom was fairly spacious but looked tired and there was no wow factor to it the staff were pleasant but it felt as if this was more out of contractual obligation rather than any real desire to please overall we were very disappointed and wouldn t recommend this hotel
