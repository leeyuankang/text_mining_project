it was cold we had booked afternoon tea for but only came we were waiting at least mins for the missing one to arrive there was a mix up with the booking check in took ages we were sent to separate desks so despite requesting rooms together they were well spread apart breakfast was very very average and the room was very very small cosy double means very cosy
