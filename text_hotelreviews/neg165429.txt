the hotel inside was very cold especially my room i called and asked for a portable heater nothing happened for hours i called again and nothing happened for another minutes i was too cold and felt uncomfortable i had to wear my coat and called the last time and finally got the portable heater after hours and min waiting and calls i understand if they have to search for it and all but they could at least give me a heads up and let me know what is going on i found the service to be very poor the staff in the hotel were generally not kind or friendly the front desk staff were the worst the check in worker was mumbling and did not speak clearly when talking to me i could not hear what she was saying she didn t look like she wanted to talk to me at all the impression i got was that i should feel sorry to even ask questions such as where is the gym and do i have to pay for the newspaper her directions to the gym for instance were it s there to the right up there somewhere you can find it which i didn t find helpful when i called regarding the heater they sounded very annoyed as well very frustrating but at least the workers in the breakfast restaurant were very friendly i had around interactions with staff during my stay and other than the personnel in the restaurant all were poor
