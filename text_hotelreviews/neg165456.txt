too long to book in the hotel needs to think about actively offering people with access issues a quicker means of booking in i told staff i couldn t stand for long periods because of a long term knee problem however i was told i had to wait minutes to check in as a large group had arrived really sad because the hotel was lovely maybe the hotel could suggest it s busy check in times in advance
