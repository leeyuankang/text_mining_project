the wifi was worse than when i stayed last year it isn t free and available throughout the wifi couldn t be accessed from my room and only very slowly and intermittently in the foyer and bar in addition a speed of mbs is pitiful for an operation like the strand palace to be giving customers in this day and age the reception staff have a plan of which indicates rooms with limited wifi so if the problem is known about why not do something about it
