design of the hotel rooms very dated not tastefully renovated bathrooms are ridiculous small overall very bad lighting furniture and interior is very weak stains on the carpet breakfast in the morning was crowded felt like a typical tourist hotel with standard food quality is okay very disappointed there are way better hotels in central london for the same price never stay there again
