i have visited the hotel before and this time i have found out several things i was not happy with breakfast has deteriorated a bit and there are short cuts in the butter and marmelate range and their qualitiy no taste flavor stale apples on offer only one type of tea now available in the rooms the consierge would give only the option to pay uk pounds for a taxi to heathrow when i discovered that there are other services so that you can pay as little as uk pounds for the same trip furthermore unwilling to keep your name and or help you find another hotel visitor to share the taxi cost i stayed nights and if i had not asked for a change of sheets they would not have done it horrible brand of shampoo and body cream and terrible packaging no pleasant smell bags do not stand on the shower tray and they make a mess when squeezed what is wrong with a broad bottom bottle to stand on the rails of the tray rather than always slipping through the rails and landing on the shower floor irritating not to be able to switch tv channels without the big screen showing and to have to do it mannualy each time
