the bathroom was very small drying space after taking a shower was awkward the noise transference from the next door room was upsetting as next door neighbours carried on talking very loudly until gone the morning we both had important appointments to get to that day every word was audible we were unable to use the shaver socket in the bathroom reported this and reminded twice but no action taken no feedback so for the three days of our stay the socket remained unmended the organisation at breakfast was poor appreciate that the hotel is large and there are a high number of people to get through but it was pretty chaotic the beds could do with more comfortable mattresses and the pillows were hard and lumpy
