queue at check in but to be expected i suppose as it was there was also an enormous queue to be seated for breakfast which although looked horrendous when we first arrived went down really quick paid a really high price this time we have stayed before at this hotel before a lot cheaper nothing going on in london so not clear why was so expensive
