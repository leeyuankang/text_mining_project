the hotel bar was awful the cappacino u had was very expensive for a coffee but we where in london so expect it to be a little more expensive but when i pay nearly for a coffee it would be nice for it to be hot a taste nice then we had to wait another mins just to get a replacement which wasn t much better i thought the decor and furniture was tired and for the prices charged i would expect a higher never of quility either that or put the prices down and i would have had a different expectation of the place
