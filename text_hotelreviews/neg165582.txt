had to wait for over an hour to check in had to leave our luggage with the porter as we had dinner pre booked and checked in later in the evening worst customer service ever experience never even said sorry that we had been through this experience also if you have already checked in online they dont ever go the the quick check in desk so everyone has to queue up in the same queue
