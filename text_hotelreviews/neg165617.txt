we paid a lot of money for an executive room but it was extremely tiny and no bigger than a postage stamp the room was located in the middle of the hotel so we had a tiny window that looked out onto a grubby brick wall therefore the room was dark and dingy the bed was also very small definately not worth the extortionate price
