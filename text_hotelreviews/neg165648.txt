the bed was most uncomfortable with a very hard mattress and pillows but were told they were new we were offered a topper next day but we were only stopping the one night suggest a note offering this in the bedroom would be a good idea the breakfast would have been very good had the plates not been cold it was a special treat for my husband s birthday and left feeling a bit let down
