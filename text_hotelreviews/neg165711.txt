i booked through booking com and registered myself and two children when we got to the hotel they had only registered two people and the room we got did not fit an extra bed so all three of us had to sleep in the same bed the first night the remaining four nights we were able to upgrade the room to a larger room so they could fit in an extra bed and i had to pay for the upgrade it was probably booking com s search engine that was to blame i had prepaid the hotelbill but when i checked out the receptionist asked me to pay for the stay again i m glad i was awake enough to remind her that i had already payed or it would have been a really expencive stay i was very happy with the hotel exept for those details
