although we paid more to have an executive room with air conditioning we were disappointed with the size of the double room the bathroom was very small and the positioning of the shower curtain around the bath made it very cramped after reading their description of these rooms we were expecting a bit more space the view was of three walls and windows which was not such a big deal but when a room is classed as executive your expectations are raised adding bathrobes slippers etc to a very average room does not make it executive
