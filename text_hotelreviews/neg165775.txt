one of the worst beds every to sleep on the room had no ac which apparently is only offered in upgraded rooms i find that silly and petty thanks for the fan overall it was a bit over priced for what you get when one stays in a hotel they usually want a great bed and comfortable room this was below average in both areas the toilet had a heated towel unit that was kept together with electrical tape and exposed wires not what i expect from a hotel of this calibre
