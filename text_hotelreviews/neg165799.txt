the room was hideously small i reserved a standard single after staying in it for days i m sure room is a cosy single that s the hotel s code for a single room which is just slightly larger than a closet the elevated shower you have to climb up into it is tiny a bit of a hazard one slip on soap or water you will fall out of the shower down onto the sink the weather was warm with a breeze but as none blew in the window the room was stifling even with a fan i had to ask for a luggage rack ice bucket as none was provided i had only towel for nights until i requested more all in all it was a miserable stay
