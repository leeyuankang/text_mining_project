the staff there are thieves we checked out in the morning and left dior suits in the wardrobe and an hermes sandal but when we came back to collect it the staff told us they couldn t find it and even called the manager but she said they didn t find anything we told them we were going to call the police and the manager even told us not to bother as it was late in the night they told us many times to com back the next morning to check with housekeeping when we actually did call the police to report in front of them the manager immediately took all my stuff down my shoes were actually in the box and all labels when thye returned it to me it was without the box so they had the intention to keep it
