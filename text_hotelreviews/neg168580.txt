scrambled eggs didn t taste good even the colour didn t look right the slice toaster didn t work had to wait there and watch that the toast didn t stay in too long and burn would have liked to see whole wheat sliced bread and oatmeal cereal being offered some people may not mind a soft mattress or perhaps not like a firm mattress however my back really needs a firm mattress so i didn t sleep well at all the first few nights fortunately the rooms are large enough so i decided to put the twin mattress on the floor and after that my back didn t hurt anymore the mattress and box spring really need to be replaced in the bedrooms bathrooms need upgrading so shower stall has walls all around it and bathtubs need to have a shower curtain or sliding glass doors to avoid splashing water all over the bathroom floor not all sinks had working stoppers so some sinks couldn t hold water our bathroom door didn t close shut in our room but it did in our daughter s room there is no exhaust fan in the bathroom so the towels take a long time to dry there really needs to be more than just hand towels in a double room website really needs to let people know that facecloths are not provided for those who just want to wash their face and hands to freshen up or to wipe up the water on the sink and counter
