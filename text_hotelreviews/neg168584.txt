lack of variety for breakfast no restaurant for meals charged my card for one night stay although hotel has claimed this was only a block since this was a fully cancellable booking till pm on day of arrival the charge was levied days prior to arrival the block still not reversed although full payment has been made and my credit card statement still carrying the charge will wait days and if not cleared then will need to follow up with the property room numbers
