i was surprised that the room was cleaned in the late afternoon i had walked around paris all day and was expecting to relax on my return to the room and take a bath and then relax with a glass of wine but there was a knock on the door at around pm for the cleaning to be done i could have said no but good customer service is about providing a service that is not intrusive on the customer another surprise was that i needed to make an international call and the automated machine response was that this feature was not authorised when i spoke with reception it was suggested that i had dialled incorrectly i don t mean to undermine staff but i informed them that i had followed instructions and was given an impatient look by one of them the other came up to my room and tried the number i needed to phone and the machine gave him the same response it was suggested that i might like to make my call from the reception phone for a couple of minutes i explained that it was a personal call and i didn t want to make it in a public area i was expecting the fault to be fixed and i am aware that they called in technicians but they were apparently unable to fix the problem i asked times on different days but i was never able to make a private call to the overseas number disappointing customer service
