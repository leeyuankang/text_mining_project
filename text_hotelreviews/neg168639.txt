alot just because it s on this very chic street famed for it s designer boutiques this hotel really does not belong there firstly i arrived and told my room ready when i opened the door to my room i was met by a sour faced looking woman who didn t even say hello just told me abruptly j arrive tout suite after i waited she left the room and looked again at me rather sour faced not a great start at all the room smelt strange it looked clean enough but i could see they are not doing such a great job of cleaning it properly my first night was that bad that i actually did not stay the second and stayed with a friend i was woken up at with the people in the room above consistently moving the electrical outside shutters up and down then i could here a noise inside the cupboard where the mini bar was i lay still listening and i realised it was a mouse or something else i got up and switched on the light and called reception immediately the noise stopped as soon as i put on the light and was moving i ve had mice in a previous flat before i know that as soon as a light goes on or they hear feel movement they go very still anyway the guy came quickly and checked but he didn t check behind the minibar but assured me there was nothing there i kept the light on the rest of the night and didn t get any sleep the hotel is old and in need of some major refurbishment on my floor there was trolleys for the cleaners everywhere and bags and it was really unpleasant unlike in other hotels the cleaning ladies were just miserable and rude it just created a bad feeling coupled with a smelly room whcih potentially has vermin lingering around the price was almost euros a night which was ridiculous don t anybody be fooled by the road it s on and the pictures they put as their main picture they only apply to their more expensive rooms
