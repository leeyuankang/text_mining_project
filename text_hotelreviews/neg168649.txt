everything was an absolute disappointment to the point i had to change hotel in the middle of my stay this is far from being a stars hotel wouldn t even give one star it s dirty old noisy the breakfast is terrible wifi is poor and they were doing works i would not recommend this hotel at all and i strongly recommend that if the work are for renovation that they close the hotel during renovation because it is a shame
