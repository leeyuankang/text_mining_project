we had an issue with the cleaning service we left the sign for the staff to clean up our room but when we came back the room wasn t done and the sign was turned the other way do not disturb that could be an honest mistake but what did bother me was that on the day we were leaving the staff came to our door and knock on it at to check if the room was ready to be made why didn t they do that the first day and check if we needed the room clean it felt that they wanted the room quickly that last day
