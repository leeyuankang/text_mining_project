the bath was rank stained brown i ended up just washing at the sink there was a stink of smoke in our bathroom from about generally expensive but good quality like for fries the twin beds are up against each other so its like a shared bed anyway crashing outside lorries and metal pallets at the digital clock on the tv was annoying i recommend unplugging before you go to sleep i also unplugged the bright clock radio no free wifi
