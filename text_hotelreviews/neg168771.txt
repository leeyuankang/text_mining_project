as we tried out packing very light we planned on washing our clothing a few times a towel heater helped us so much while we visited paris for a few days in between our days at your hotel i know it s a luxury but without one at your hotel it took days for our clothes to dry one day we asked the maid to come back in a little bit since we were almost ready to go out for the day but she never did and another day she never came at all but we chose not to report it and get someone in trouble
