it is a shame that this house still bears the name hilton the rooms are dark small and extremely noisy substandard if you stand up in the bathtub to take a shower your head is fully emerged into the ceiling panel the furniture should be immediately disposed of dirty and overused if it wasn t for the location none of us would ever stay there
