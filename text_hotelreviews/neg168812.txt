the first night i could not sleep because of the aircon ventilation it was very loud and could not be switched off i was totally exhausted the whole day not ideal when on business trip on the second day i got another room which was quieter the windows don t isolate from the street noise the deco carpet in the room doors of the elevator etc are old fashioned it would need a complete renovation i paid for nights incl breaktfast the quality is not worth the price
