response from staff when colleague trapped in a lift for half an hour we actually released our colleague from the lift ourselves after being told twice that there was someone on the first floor where the lift was stuck only to find when we got to the first floor that there was no member of staff staying with the person trapped in the lift we are sending a formal letter of complaint from our lawyer in regard to this the procedure they had in place was either not being adhered too or was totally unsuitable for the situation combine this with the name of hilton and the situation is even more unacceptable there were many breaches of health and safety during this situation the main response we got from the day manager was that when you cross a road you don t expect to get run over
