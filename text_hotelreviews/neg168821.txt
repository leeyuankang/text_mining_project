check in was not good the credit card machine did not accept any of my cards although they were accepted elsewhere on the same day i ended up having to pay upfront in cash despite this i was refused breakfast the next day unless i paid in advance because there was no credit card on file housekeeping was also poor in particular no soap was provided and i had to ask at reception who only provided hairdo conditioner and shower gel
