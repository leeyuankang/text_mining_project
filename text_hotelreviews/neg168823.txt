i have asked for early check in but i was told that i only can go to executive room for extra charge and as we were very tired we had paid the extra but the room was normal size double room and nothing like an executive room at all at the time of booking i have chosen to pay cash at my departure but i was told my credit card already was charged for being a hilton hotel it has a very basic facility compare to other cheap chain hotels
