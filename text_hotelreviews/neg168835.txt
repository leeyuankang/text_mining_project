this alleged star hotel is in desperate need of renovation we were upgraded to an executive room that was seriously dated poor condition and not too clean the bar area also dated and unclean with sub standard furniture and service after asking for a minute to look at the drinks menu barely sat down on first contact had to go to bar after minutes to order a cocktail and a beer neither of which were good these were returned discussed with the manager and not charged fortunately we gave breakfast a miss even though paid for as part of room in order not to be further disappointed could not wait to leave
