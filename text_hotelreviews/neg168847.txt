even though it is the law to provide an allergens list for the restaurant we were repeatedly told that they didn t have gluten free menu eventually the chef hand ticked a menu for items which were gluten free but we were not convinced that the staff had any idea how to ensure that myself and my coeliac daughters didn t suffer ill health after eating the meal if there had been any other option we would have left but it was pouring with rain and we were all exhausted after a busy working day at the olympia exhibition centre thankfully after a long wait when the meal arrived it was delicious
