our room was very cold even with the heating turned right up it was freezing we were at the front of the building as well so it was very noisy through the night with the traffic as we were working at olympia for a show on the second night we were out for networking drinks and by the time we got back to the hotel we were wanting to order food we got told due to the time this had to be done from our room and we only had an option of sandwiches and pizza when we tried to call it went to voicemail i ask the bar staff if i could order it there and deliver to our room and she said no i went down to reception and the lady was not helpful at all she looked very confused with the whole matter finally i called reception from my room phone and got the food delivered but to be honest the bread on the sandwiches were stale and it was just awful unfortunately we are staying with you again in september for another show as this is already booked i can only hope that our experience is somewhat better
