checkin time at was very late when we did go to check in there was a queue which was very slow it took around mins to check in we were charged service charge in the bar which was ridiculous considering on one day we were the only ones in there and yet still had to wait quite a bit for our drinks then later on we had to clear our glasses off the table ourselves as no one came near our table it was also quite difficult to go to restaurant with a buggy during busy times as only one lift serviced the restaurant and lifts are tiny so it was always full
