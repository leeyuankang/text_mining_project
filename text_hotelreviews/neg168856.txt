the hotel is tired and outdated in terms of decor staff although efficient showed very little interest in my complaint of a bad nights sleep for my two year old son as we were put in a room right next to a housekeeping closet and entry and exit to this room happened until late into the evening the room itself felt rather dirty the carpet should be replaced or burnt it was filthy the bathrooms fittings were very old there was rust a cracked basin pock marked bath and the entire room felt generally unclean and certainly unpolished very disappointing stay it seems the hotel relies on regular patronage from the olympias exhibition centre as well as numerous airline staff and as they are still getting bookings they have made no effort to update the rooms or hotel decor in anyway
