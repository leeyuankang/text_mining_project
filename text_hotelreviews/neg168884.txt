greeting by the frontline staff can be improved we got stares instead of a smile and offering concierge service would be greatly appreciated we obviously had luggages but left to looked after them ourselves and all staff just looked on as if we were some kind like a terrorist tottally didn t expect this esp from hilton so upset paid for this such a bad experience
