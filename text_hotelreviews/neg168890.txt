the exterior of the hotel looks like a office block curb appeal they don t show this on booking pictures reception area is modern like you d expect but it all goes down hill from there rooms look like they are still in the with old brown carpets and wood furnishings when i first arrived i was put in a tiny box room with foot bath and afrosted window that opened onto a wall in fairness they did upgrade me after i had to complain as i paid for one night the beds are hard i can only compare to putting a duvet on a wood floor and using that for a mattress pillows are soft though in summary like a lot of hilton hotels dated and in dire need of modernisation there much better hotels than this is london for the same money or cheaper
