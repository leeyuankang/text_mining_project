the room was tiny with only light by the door and one in the bathroom making the room even smaller darker and very dull on top of this of the lamps did not work the bed was uncomfortable unclean and creaky even the slightest movement turning round to get comfy made a tremendous amount of noise i checked under the wooden bed and the legs were cracked and split the description of what was included in the double deluxe room did not reflect on what we were given the staff were awfully rude with the exception of one or two people the waiters waitresses in the bar seemed to ignore our table but wait on some others as usual users of hilton hotels through leasure and business we did not expect what we had come to and i doubt we will ever use a hilton again definitely not worth the money extremely disappointed
