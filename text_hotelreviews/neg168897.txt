i booked this hotel room in april of to make sure i got the best price and that i could actually get a room upon arrival everything seemed fine off we went to the horse show and returned at to go to the bar as we had done for years on the trot on a saturday night and also i might add more or less the reason we go to the show we were turned away as fei had a party and we did not have the wrist bands i could bore you with all the details that ensued after this i e abysmal staff service ignorance and inability to help from everyone involved but the long and short of this story is that the hotel staff here did not provide the services that we had paid for and tried to get away with claiming no responsibility really ruined my london trip away and will definitely be my last time paying to stay here
