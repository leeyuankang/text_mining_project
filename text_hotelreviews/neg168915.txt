we arrived and room was not ready this was and check in was after moved to another executive room as per our booking and as we were trying to get comfortable after our journey there were staff in our room separating beds and putting sheets on etc we went to the executive lounge at this was supposed to be open until but they were already clearing the food etc so again not very welcoming we expected far better than this having booked a twin executive suite very disappointed
