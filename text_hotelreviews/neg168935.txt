breakfast was very pricey at nearly per head they offer a credit off your restaurant or room service bill if you forgo room service for a day but beware it does not appear that housekeeping are very good at passing this information on to the billing department they did not automatically add the credit to our bill and when we queried this with the girl at reception although pleasant she appeared quite reluctant to accept that this was an error on their part in the end she disappeared for five minutes and returned and confirmed it would be taken off our bill but there was no apology or admission that they had made an oversight in the first place our advice would be to make sure you tell reception if you decide to do this as although they just say that you simply need to place the hanger on your door that information probably will not make it onto your bill rooms whilst clean appear to be quite drab and tired and the lifts were extremely unreliable also our bed was very hard and uncomfortable which was quite disappointing considering the room rate and the fact that they upgraded us on arrival
