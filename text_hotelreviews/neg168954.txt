the staff were rude and the concierge wouldn t give us any information about how to get around london the toilet was broken on arrival and it took three phone calls before anything was done and eventually somebody came up at so we had to wait up until they left before we could sleep and we had driven for hours on the second day we got back at to get ready for going to the lion king that night however we got back to the room and housekeeping had not been in i called down to say we were in a rush and wanted showers with no clean towels it took them half an hour to get us towels meaning we didn t have time for a shower before we went out for the night the next day when we returned there was a handyman in the bathroom retiling the bathroom he left after using all the toilet roll for god knows what and the bathroom was a mess from the materials he was using to re tile there was only lift working for the whole hotel for the duration of our stay which meant we had to wait for roughly mins every time when house keeping did come i asked the staff member for towels and to not bother cleaning the room she said she didn t speak english and came into the room and started cleaning around us the room we were allocated too had boilers air vents outside that were very noisy all night so gave us a disturbed sleep when going for breakfast we put a do not disturb sign on the door as we had money ipads phones lying around and when we came back from breakfast someone was in our room overall the stay was absolutely horrific and as a hilton honours member i am so disappointed that i will probably never stay in a hilton again
