the tube station which should have been the closest seems to not be in use so we got off at earls court but it is better to get off at high street kensington as its more straight forward i hoped for a better view from the room as it is in a nice part of london but instead we looked over the back of the hotel where the bins were and we couldn t open the window very much the room was fine it was clean but i felt needed a bit of something to brighten it up
