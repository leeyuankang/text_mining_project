room was poor charged a excess fee in order to charge to the room despite declining that option which has not been refunded a week later we arrived early not expecting the room to be ready they told us to call back at and it would be ready we returned at and they informed us the room was still not ready and that they where willing to give us a smaller room at no discounted price otherwise they could not promise when the original room would be ready waited in the society bar for over before being served despite there only being other tables of people
