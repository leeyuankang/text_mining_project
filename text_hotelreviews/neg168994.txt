my room number was very much in need of refurbishment the brown carpet was both ugly and dirty looking and completely off putting also the mattress was lumpy and grossly uncomfortable obviously should have been discarded years ago as a matter of fact a most unfortunate experience and personally one could say equivelant to a star hotel
