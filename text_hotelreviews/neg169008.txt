our bathroom was adapted for disabled people so didn t have a bath and water completely covered the floor when we used the shower making it difficult to go back into the bathroom there was a shower seat which was extremely rusty and looked disgusting there were no surfaces in the bathroom to put toilet bags etc we fully appreciate the need to have rooms suitable for disabled people but feel that we should have been advised of this fact beforehand the hotel is quite a long walk from the nearest underground station overall the furnishings looked tired and a bit shabby breakfast was too expensive so we decided to eat elsewhere
