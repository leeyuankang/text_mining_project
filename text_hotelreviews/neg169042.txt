the parking spaces in the hotel s parking lot are very narrow and difficult to manage with a wheelchair and there is no specific disabled parking bay i found the noise levels in the room quite high as our room faced kensington high street we booked the room on a booking com special rate at the usual rate i think the hotel is over priced
