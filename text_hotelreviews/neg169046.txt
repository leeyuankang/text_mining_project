for the money i paid the room was the smallest i ve ever stayed in in london then when i looked out the window it was onto a tiny area that was filthy and don t think ever been cleaned the bathroom was in a terrible state there was a drainage hole in the middle of the stained floor that was full of dirt hair etc around the toilet the floor was stained the sink had a massive crack in it the shower head needed to be cleaned as the water sprayed in every direction and it smelt damp in there i would not recommend this hotel luckily we didn t stay in it long as was just a place to rest our heads but for a hilton i would not be going back
