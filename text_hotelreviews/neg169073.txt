our bath was disgusting it had horrible brown orangey stains i wouldn t step in it without having a towel down in the bath there was alot of dust on day of arrival i hated the duck feathered pillows and duvet i would of preferred a mini fridge rather than a mini bar the rooms could do with being updated to match the reception area
