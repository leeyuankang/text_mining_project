hotel booking wrong took to get room sorted booked for breakfast for people kept telling us it was for only every morning ages to sort out no booking record at restaurant had table finally then told to busy in bar to be able to have cocktails made took over an hour to get starter staff unhelpful and offish at times did not enjoy our stay found it very stressful and terrible for a hotel of that caliber
