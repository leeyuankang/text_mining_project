note that the closest tube station doesn t actually function as a tube stop most of the time and is mostly overground also i left a white shirt out which must have been picked up by housekeeping as it was the same colour as the towels and sheets and never got it back or heard anything more after ringing multiple times and being assured that someone would get back to me one way or another never heard anything more was only a shirt but would have been nice to hear something
