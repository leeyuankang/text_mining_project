we were given a double when requesting a twin moreover anticipating this may happen i specifically asked if it was a twin at check in they said it was it was not also it appeared to be a smoking room we were moved unfortunately the toilet in the new room had difficulty with the flush which was solved by taking off the top of the cistern this is not really what you expect from a star hotel
