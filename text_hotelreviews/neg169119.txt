hotel were unable to find booking on arrival leading to check in taking minutes to be told we had received a complimentary upgrade was quite frankly insulting having stayed in a number of hotels including hilton hotels i am very aware that this was nothing more than the basic room i am more than happy to stay in the room type i have booked but do not appreciate being lied to over a complimentary upgrade sealant around the window in room has come away and was causing noise pollution into the room in an already noisy room due to the business of the road outside of the hotel not only did this cause the room to be much louder but also caused the cold to come into the room we asked to change room due to this but would told the hotel was fully booked and offered no other assistance and no effort made to resolve our complaint we re disturbed in the morning by housekeeping despite having do not disturb sign on door housekeeper had said the paperwork showed the room as empty this was still hours before check out was due would also note that this hotel is not well located for activities in central london eg museums and west end we should ve researched this better overall not a pleasent or relaxing stay
