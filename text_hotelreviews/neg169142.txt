the free wifi didn t work at all unfortunately for a hilton we though the room was a bit tatty such as the uneven carpet we were in room plus the window view was a bit uninspiring ie a brick wall i know it s london prices but i have stayed in fantastic boutique hotels for the same price so you can t help but be a bit disappointed
