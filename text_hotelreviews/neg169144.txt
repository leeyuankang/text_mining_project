this hotel is not up to the standard you will expect from a hilton at best going on global standards way overpriced aircon in room did not work blew stale warm air not even a mini bar tv system is painful to use takes minutes working through menus and adverts to get a channel on annoying sub titles set as default and the button to remove them throws you back to the main menu room dated s decor no mention of free wi fi until asked for instead they try to charge extortionate rates through your browser closest tube is not connected to main lines so quite inconvenient
