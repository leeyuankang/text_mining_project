there were a number of reasons we are giving this review as negative firstly somewhere very close to our room was either a service lift or some sliding doors that were in use all day the noise felt like it was in our room and was impossible to ignore i spoke to the receptionist and she did offer us a move but we were exhibiting at the olympia for four days and simply did not have time morning or night or the energy to change rooms the bathroom was very tatty in places the door had clearly been very wet and was spreading badly at the base areas of tiling etc had been filled and generally it was not what you would expect the queues for breakfast in the mornings were long and the restaurant staff one in particular rather stern for what is obviously a hotel servicing many hundreds of guests attending shows at the exhibition centre all needing breakfast at around the same time this is very poor wi fi connection very poor blocked toilets next to restaurant one day husband reported it and they were still blocked the next day sorry its so long but this was a real disappointment
