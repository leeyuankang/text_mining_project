the check in process was terrible we arrived at approximately check in after is listed on the confirmation form and were told that we had to wait more than hour before our room would be ready also i would not consider this to be a star hotel perhaps finally the website indicates that grange buckingham serves breakfast daily for all its hotel residents in the breakfast room on the ground floor you can choose from a variety of breakfast items including both continental and cooked breakfast selections i assumed that the breakfast was included in the price of the room as no extra costs are mentioned terrible to misinform potential guests
