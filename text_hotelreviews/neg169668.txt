the sofa bed lacked a thick enough mattress to make it comfortable the tv had some issues however this was not an issue so we didn t advise staff until check out i am sure they would have addressed it if we had needed it the maid entered the room early in the morning without knocking which was a surprise i m sure it was a genuine mistake and no harm done
