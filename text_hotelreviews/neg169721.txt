noise from outside our bedroom window we were in room first floor room at rear of hotel although there was no noise from other guests adjacent rooms in the hotel we were kept awake at night by a loud electrical hum from somewhere at the rear of the building we could not establish where it was coming from but it kicked in at about and then on and off throughout the night it sounded like a compressor on a refrigeration unit very very loud intrusive and resulted in very little sleep on friday saturday nights it was so bad we decide to end our trip return home a day early we did ask on friday night if there was another room we could relocate too but were told there was nothing available
