we were in an attic room not ideal if tall not reached by the lift which meant a lot of stairs so if you can t manage stairs let them know in advance to get a room near a lift the kitchenette would be useful for a longer stay i guess but it would have been better for us to have a coffee pod machine especially as the reception coffee machine was out of order
