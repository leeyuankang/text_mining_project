the bathroom was scruffy cracked tiles on the floor silicon which was stained in the shower and as you open the shower door the complete screen is lose at the base it is a shame because a few hours by one tradesman could over come most of these points the ductwork in the bedroom emits a clicking noise which gets on your nerves at night i thought it was the air con so turned it off but it wasn t it was coming from the fresh air ductwork into the room so really a typical london room at this price i was expecting better but it sits in that category of could do better
