the hotel had no bar or restaurant breakfast is only continental delivered to your room the fittings in the rooms are a little old but not damaged the bathroom again is not the newest but is big enough and works fine the grouting around the shower shows signs of mould but this is almost certainly due to the age of the shower enclosure and not due to lack of cleaning
