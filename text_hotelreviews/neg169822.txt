the room was ok but i wouldn t stay here again there was only about foot of space at the foot of the bed to squeeze bent over by the wall mounted tv to get to the other side washcloths were not available even on request because they are afraid one might clean the kitchenette with them and lastly the remote didn t work properly but when that was reported the tv no longer worked at all the room was quiet though most of the staff were very helpful
