nothing wrong really just as feedback to help the management to keep it up and improving i would recommend to update the description of the hotel in here as the number of stars on the advert it says but it is actually a star hotel the wifi is patchy and no cellular network coverage on the basement another thing i also would have had appreciated is the description of the rooms i booked a executive deluxe studio to find out it was a room on the basement with no natural light although that didn t bother me after such a nice treatment but when we got to the room i was devastated as i felt that i had been cheated
