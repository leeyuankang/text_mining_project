the beds are cheaply constructed and i suffered terrible neck and upper back pain eventually a board had to be placed under the mattress apparently this has happened to other guests as the staff was not certain a board would be available at the given time or day as it may already have been in use i waited three nights before complaining because i don t like to complain the rooms are far too small for the cost one cannot open a suitcase and the bathroom door at the same time we were cramped in every position other than on the bed but then awoke from pain due to the mattress dirty tea cups were left in the room each day and not replaced with clean ones until we requested them in the evening upon returning to the room housekeeping did not once even remove used cups or saucers during the eight days we were guests they were not careful about billing we were charged for two persons at breakfast everyday when only one of us ate breakfast in the hotel after checking with management it was agreed to correct the error which should not have been made in the first place a room for two has no place to sit other than a bed a half size chair i m not sure how this hotel received a five star rating this is my first review of a hotel after many years of bookings in major cities throughout the world
