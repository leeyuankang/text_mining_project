we arrived at almost and our room wasn t ready so we were told we were to be upgraded to a luxury room the room was a shoe box with sloping walls making it smaller with absolutely no view a brick wall and large air con units right outside the window away this shouldn t have been a hotel room at all but a store room the noise from these units is like the drone of an aircraft and we both had terrible nights sleep the photos are not tricks this was our view have a look at the luxury rooms on the website something is not quite right after we complained were given money off the bill however we felt completely let down by staff trying to tell us rooms are only categorised by their sqft not by their features i e brick wall view the photograph of our room was used as a description for a superior room so much for luxury we ve stayed at the sister hotel the soho hotel far better with large standard rooms check out is at on sundays boo we won t be going back
