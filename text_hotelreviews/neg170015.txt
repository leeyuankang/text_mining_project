the room wasn t as booked with a double bed rather than king size it was small with very little natural light the hairdryer was broken the shower leaked and created a lake in the ensuite we were woken early by workmen drilling and hammering overall not good value for money there are much nicer rooms overlooking the garden in dorset square make sure you request one of these
