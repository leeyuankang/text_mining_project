we rejected the first two rooms we were presented with as the first was in the basement and was very gloomy with next to no natural light while the second was on ground level and boasted an awful view of the service ally behind the hotel although the windows were large all that could be seen was the industrial plant for the air conditioning system we were honestly about to cancel and go to a different hotel but ended up downgrading our room type for a smaller room they all seemed small anyway which in the end did the job i ve stayed in other firmdale hotels and generally like them however i don t think i d stay in the dorset square hotel again as frankly it felt overpriced for what it was
