the service was not great no one said hello goodbye when we would come in leave there was no turn down service no towels were replaced very expensive though a much cheaper rate was offered on your website but the hotel could do nothing about it the light flickered in the room two beds were stuck together no nail file even upon request a basic amenity had to bring up our own luggage despite telling reception we needed it to change for a lunch reservation we waited then called down to ask about its location then we waited then got fed up of waiting so went to collect it from downstairs ourselves at euros definitely not worth the money very disappointed
