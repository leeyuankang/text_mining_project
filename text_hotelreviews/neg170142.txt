i booked my room and paid for deluxe room with balcony when i arrived to the hotel the lady on the counter ignored the balcony so i have to remind her about it but she told me your booking without balcony so i showed her the booking confirmation then she said oh we did not get details from booking com even i paid for my room months ago then she said actually it s booking com problem after all of that she said i need to tallk to thr manager then she came up with two choices either to take room without balcony or other room with hole take you out the room which was awful i have no choice so i have to accept anything they offer was very bad experience
