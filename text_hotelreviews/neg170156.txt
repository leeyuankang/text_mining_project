breakfast while very good was a bit expensive especially when you consider the quality of the croissants and pains au chocolat available within a very short walk out the front door of this hotel it s not every morning that you get to wake up in paris so taking a walk in a beautiful part of one of the prettiest cities on earth to grab a fresh french pastry warm out of the oven is not punishment and you ll save a small fortune if you do this we treated ourselves to the delicious breakfast at the hotel on only one out of two days when we were staying as guests previously
