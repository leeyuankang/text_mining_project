the pillows for me are too soft therefore i wake up with a pain in the neck if there were options on pillows it would be perfect i booked a standard room with a king sized bed however i ended up with a room which was very small and only with a single bed this was very different from what i learned from the website and images the shower room was also very small and design didn t really help to keep your bathroom dry and clean after the shower there was water everywhere on the bathroom floor so be careful when you step out of the shower room
