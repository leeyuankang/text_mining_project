the restaurant oh my then need to work on that part our first experience was dinner the first evening very odd starter even more odd main course and we skipped the dessert starter was a really odd mix of toast bread egg odd herbs and oil for main course we had a steak that was clearly boiled and didn t taste of anything also medium is not well done served with bearnaise tasting only of lemon and so much butter that the it would melt on the meat next morning we had just about the same experience at the breakfast bread seemed to be bake off croissants were soft as they were a day old second morning was nothing different except there were almost no bread and no service as we waited really long for an omelette and almost gave up room service was plain odd ordered a late night dessert of ice we choose brownie out of a selection of cookie brownie and oreo and for some reason they managed to bring ice with oreo and a cookie on the side that was quite funny when it comes to wifi it is extremely slow really we gave up on it at several occations at check in the receptionist told us that wifi would be free despite it would charge us upon connecting which led to quite a discussion when checking out at the moment they are carrying out some general maintaince on the wood finish doors walls etc which means you will have the full experience of a man scratching on your door like a desperate cat at eight in the morning on a sunday that i really didn t need
