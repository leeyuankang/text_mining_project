i was very disappointed that the hotel management could not refund one nights room rental because i needed to leave a day early due to train to bordeaux not leaving early enough for me to catch my flight home i booked through booking com and i was told that hotel management had the discretion to refund the night as a marriott rewards member i expected better service from the hotel and i will factor their decision in when i make future hotel reservations
