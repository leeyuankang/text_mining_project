my only gripe was that the hotel had a function on our last night which involved extremely loud music until midnight we may as well have been there ourselves it was so loud not good when trying to get to sleep the night before a hour flight home but when i complained the next morning we were compensated by way of a check out for free the hotel s response was outstanding
