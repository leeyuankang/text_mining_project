main observation to report the chairs in the library restaurant were not compatible with the tables there was a difference of appropriate nine inches deficit in the chair seat to the top of the table this was a very unnatural way to sit and enjoy the meal the seating in the breakfast area was perfect although i did point out that the arm of my seat was loose and required some attention the food and ambiance in the library were what i was expecting as i have dined there in the past and another reason i changed hotels for my last night birthday celebration in london hopefully on my next visit to the rubens my feedback to you will have been noted and possibly resolved
