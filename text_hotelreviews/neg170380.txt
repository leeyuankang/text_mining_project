the double room i booked was not what i expected they checked my wife and i into one which is smaller that most other single rooms in other hotels of the same catergory there was hardly any space to move in and i kept banging into the tv and the furniture and the window which looked out into some place that resembled a construction site it was a struggle just to open our luggage and i nearly fell of the tiny double bed one morning when i awoke the hot water from the shower came at an intermitten pace so i shivered when i showered i wished i could indicate a comfort level lower that unsatisfactory i could not check out earlier as i have prepaid the reception staff were nonchalent and confirmed it was a double room when i notified them and werereluctant to assist in changing my room
