this is a nice hotel but we were maybe unlucky my wife was in the bath and i was in a dressing robe and all of a sudden there was a man in our room he said he was stocking the fridge scared us both phoned reception to check he was with rubens and they confirmed and said they would talk to him the room should have been prepared properly and staff should wait for a reply before walking in i put the bolt across after that but we had gone from relaxed to oh my god there s a man in our room then we had a smell of burning we checked phone chargers hair dryers etc eventually realised the light for the picture was stuck on the top of the door and heating up there were burn marks on top of the door reported to reception who said it was newly refurbished and they would check the only other thing that might have been a problem was at breakfast our toast and coffee didn t turn up until after we d finished eating this was solved by a free glass of champagne though turned the situation into a positive we only stayed one night so having a man in our room and then trying to locate a smell of burning wrote the whole thing off i did mention these things at the time but didn t make a big deal of it as i didn t want to waste even more of our own time
