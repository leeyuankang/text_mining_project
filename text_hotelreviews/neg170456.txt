it took quite a long time to get me checked in min and before entering the hotel the front door was locked in the morning some of the personnel entered my room without my permission i don t even know what the purpose was of the entering they also did not have a hair dryer and there we re some stains in the wall and on the chair probably because of intensive use not fresh stains at midnight they didn t have all the foods that were mentioned in the roomservice folder
