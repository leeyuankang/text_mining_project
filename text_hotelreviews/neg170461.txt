the room was extremely hot with the air conditioner set as low as it could possibly be the room still remained so hot you could feel the cold air coming out of the vent but for some reason it was not remaining in the room it was so uncomfortable that we called for a fan and they brought one up to us immediately it made a very big difference and helped the room become enjoyable if the fan were not available we would not have been able to remain in the same room
