the pictures shown online of the rooms are inaccurate my room did not look anything like the photos i paid a lot of money for this room and wish it would ve been advertised appropriately the service was also not what you d expect for the money i called one day asking for turn down service for my day trip and they only did it that one evening they also woke me up one morning very early around to tell me the ginger ale i ordered was on its way up when i didn t order any it was a decent hotel but i would ve never spent the amount of money i did on a hotel like that if it had been like they advertised and had better service then i would have i wish i had stayed somewhere else
