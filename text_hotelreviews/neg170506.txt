i was a solo traveler i booked this hotel because the room for single traveler looks spacious and very nice the room that i stayed had nothing to do with the rooms photos for single stay the room that i stayed was extremely small the bed was also very small definitely not a double bed but a larger single bed which is not right because the photos are misleading also the windows were very high from the ground which is giving a clostrophobic feeling it is a nice hotel but if the photos were displayed properly i may chose not to stay in this room this should be corrected by the hotel
