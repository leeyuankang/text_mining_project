the communication in the run up to our stay i had asked to book a table in the afternoon of our second day at the hotel and we had had a few communication issues which we did receive an apology from the restaurant manager from prior to our stay assuring everything was ok however when the afternoon arrived the booking was still wrong but they did accommodate our party without any problem
