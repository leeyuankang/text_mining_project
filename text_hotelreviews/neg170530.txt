the bar experience as each time we visited we were ignored thix included the arrival when the receptionist took us to the bar for a complimentary drink whilst waiting for our room we waited and waited and in fact the room was ready before the waiter took our order this unfortunately continued throughout our stay suite is becoming extremely tired with badly ripped quilt throw and walls fabric receeding furniture requires attention and the room no longer has that wow factor
