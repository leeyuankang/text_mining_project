rubens were good enough to upgrade us but the room was very small goodness knows what the original room would have been like all staff very accommodating however the day we left we left our case at reception to pick up an hour later when we arrived we were virtually ignored the case was brought to us but no eye contact certainly no smile the concierge left us to open the doors ourselves slightly difficult with bags a case they were not even busy we felt it was a case of we have your money now
