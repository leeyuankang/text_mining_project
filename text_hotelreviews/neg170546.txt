my room had been double booked and another guest was in my room when i arrived back at the hotel my case was also still in the room we were shown alternative rooms that were not comparable with the first room i had been given we were supposed to be going out for dinner before going to a show at the theatre that evening but our time to dine was reduced due to the mix up and viewing other rooms i was made to feel as if i was a problem by one particular member of staff behind the front desk unexpected events spoilt what should have been a really memorable visit to london and a celebration of my sons achievements
