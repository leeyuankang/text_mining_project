there is quite a bit of construction in the area and most of the rooms face construction which is not only unpleasant but noisy our room was a standard room a nice one that looked as if it had been kept up and bathroom was recently updated but faced construction right outside the window when pointing this out and asking for a quiet room we were first offered an old dated smaller room in a corner of the hotel which only had space for the bed and chair when seeing that we were upset about this the concierge moved us to a mews views room which was nice and views were delightful but the room itself was dated and old the toilet ran for minutes after flushing and made noise the carpet and walls had stains we kept the room as it was better than the original and they basically told us this is the best they can do for us the views were great and room was calm and had enough space but bathroom and overall room was old and dated wireless internet was spotty for days and on the day it went out for hours i needed to work and they are not equipped for hard wire cable not sure if it was my room or all rooms but they were confused by the entire concept of it i sat in their hallway on the hotel computer by the elevator for hours in turn they provided dinner and drinks at their restaurant to compensate overall the hotel is old and dated it has some charm and the hotel staff goes above and beyond which makes up for the negative features
