the quality of our sleep was pretty poor our room was next door to a housekeeping cabinet and whenever anything was put in there or a trolley banged on the wall our bed moved the floorboards were so creaky that anyone that walked past our room it felt like they were walking through it the bed was two single mattresses pushed together and it was very hard in the middle the pillows were also massive and rock hard our friends stayed in an extremely modern hotel very close to us for a lot less
