the lounge area for guests is very small however there are other lounges dining areas in the hotel as guests after a long day of shopping we wanted a cup of tea in the bar and found one member of staff very unaccommodating there was no space in the lounge and despite there being so many free tables in the afternoon tea room we were left standing until a table came free we also found the drinks very expensive
