when we arrived they told us hotel was over booked big problem for us was we had booked rooms and it was we had been traveling from so this was disappointing to say the least the staff were less than helpful and said sorry but what can we do they offered to try and get us another room at marble arch so two different hotels for my collegue and i shambles and poorest customer service i have every experienced having tried other hotels in the area we eventually had no choice but to take a room with a double bed and bunk up for the night we had to fight for an hour to seek discount but this was not being offered so we took the stance we didn t want to pay anything because of the complete lack of care eventually they agreed to this which was something but just a shambles all round very disappointing as nice accommodation in a great location
