in the evening prior to my departure i have asked the front desk to settle my account since i was checking out in the middle of the night i was told by the reception staff including the shift leader it could not be done when i checked out in the middle of the night the clerk could not issue the invoice as he was in the middle of the night process it is either they are using a very old software program or they could not do a very basic thing wich is done in any hotel
