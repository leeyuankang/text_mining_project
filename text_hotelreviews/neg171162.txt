our stay was shadowed with disaster from the moment we walked over the doorstep and we will certainly never return after the way we were treated in summary the management overbooked the hotel and our booking which had been made several weeks earlier could not be honoured on arriving at the hotel late on a saturday evening my parents and i were booked into two separate rooms we were informed that only one room was available the hotel didn t seem to think that it would have been more appropriate to inform us of this mess earlier but only on our arrival whereupon they frantically tried to find an alternative room in other hotels in random parts of london i ll leave it to you dear reader to imagine how successful they were in finding suitable alternatives at on a saturday night in london after much arguing in the hotel lobby we reluctantly agreed to have an extra bed placed in the one room that was available and the three of us stayed there for the first night at gross inconvenience to the three of us the three of us are all adults the following day we were provided with the second room as booked the most incredible part was that the management initially offered a discount for the first night to make up for their mess i insisted on a discount given that they had not honoured their side of the booking contract and were therefore bound to offer a full refund the following day i was informed that this request had been accepted all fine i thought at that point they ve solved it and we can consider the matter closed not quite on checking out after the night the management actually had the cheek to let us know that the discount was being given on the room that was not actually provided on the first night and not on the room where we had stayed for the first night incredulous
