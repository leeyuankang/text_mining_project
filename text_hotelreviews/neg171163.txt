the staff are not brilliant precisely they were not clear if i had the breakfast included i went to the breakfast area and they told they thought it was not included in my room so i said it was fine and was about to leave but then they made a call to check and told me that everything was fine not precising what that everything was i asked are you sure and they said yes i thought it was included and had breakfast then when i did the check out they told me i had to pay the breakfast that everything they checked was that i had a credit card so they could guarantee i would pay later but they forgot to mention that i explained the situation at the reception deck and they said they were sorry for the misunderstanding but i had to pay anyway pounds for a quite bad and limited breakfast i will not recommend at all
