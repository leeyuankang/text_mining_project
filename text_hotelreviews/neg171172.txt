room was on first floor it did its job but was quite claustrophobic due to not being able to open window that backed onto utility yard we could also feel the rumble of the underground intermittently throughout the night none of the above caused too much problems but i would request a room higher up next time our room was clean but the communal hall ways and stairs should be monitored more frequently
