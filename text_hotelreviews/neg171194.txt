i would have liked tea and coffee making facilities in the room some complimentary biscuits more choice in the mini bar i didn t like the nespresso machine as didn t know how to use it and it didn t come with any instructions i didn t like the view out of our window it was basically a brick wall i didn t like how warm the room was and that the aircon needed to be on all night the mattress on the bed was lumpy and not very comfortable for a night i could probably have stayed at a more luxurious property out of the city and travelled in
