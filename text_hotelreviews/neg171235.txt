the hotel bar was underground and quite soulless returning after our show we wanted a nightcap but bar was closed and were told we could have coffee from the machine in our room we were a family group of and because we couldn t have even a coffee in the bar and didn t want to all congregate into one bedroom meant we were wandering around trying to find a coffee house bar open with tables for our group as it happened we ended up in a tiny bakery with seating for the ladies only not pleasant having to wander amongst the young clubbers and drunks when the hotel could have supplied a drink for their residents
