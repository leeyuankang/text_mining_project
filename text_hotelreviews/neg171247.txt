our room was supposed to be ready for however when we arrived we were told the room wasn t quite ready which was fine because we arrived early we headed out for half an hour and went back to the hotel expecting our room to be ready which it wasn t so we were told to head down to the restaurant and had a drink and would be called when the room was ready we then headed back to the reception at and we re told the room was now ready the week before i had phoned the hotel to ask them if they could decorate the room as i was going to propose to my girlfriend the room was decorated which was nice but the staff had left a card addressed to mr and mrs spence which i thought was a bit presumptious and upset my girlfriend my plan was to propose at a restaurant which i had booked for but as the room wasn t ready until i had to cancel the table as you can imagine i was very disappointed and told the staff oh what had happened they asked me if i had proposed i said no its all gone a little flat now all the staff offered me was a free dinner which i accepted but wasn t happy with the solution i would like more in the way of compensation because i feel my weekend was ruined by the inability of the staff to get the room ready in time and to not correctly listen to my request very disappointed with the service is an understatement to make matters worse i had to postpone the engagement
