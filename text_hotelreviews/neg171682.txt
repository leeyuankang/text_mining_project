the front desk can be more efficient with the check in process we ve been waited for like minutes while there were only less than people in front of us also we got a problem in communicating with one of the reception lady i used my credit card to guarantee for two rooms and my friend who s to stay in one of the room will arrive later the reception lady promise that she will mark in the booking system for the gurantee so i don t need to come to the front desk again to show my credit card again when my friend arrived however my friend was required persistently by the reception that i with my credit card has to show up when she actually arrived pretty late on that night what s even worse is that reception lady who s promised to me did not even make an apology about her mis communicaiton that s definitely not a good impression on my arrival other than that the stay is good
