in my first room the air conditioning didn t work only the fan was working so i asked the reception for someone to come and see it and possibly fix it i called three times within an hour or two but no one turned up after a long wait i went to the reception and asked whether anyone was coming i was told someone would come later when i m away but when i arrived late in the evening it turned out that no one had visited my room to see what s wrong with the ac so i went to the reception again and i was given another room with apologies and that was ok no complaints here but in the new room the ac wasn t working at all the switch did not even turn on when i went to the reception again it was so overwhelmed with people checking in that there was no chance to get to speak to anyone so i gave up on further fight and since the weather was getting a bit cooler i decided to live without the ac however that s not the end of it in the new room there was also a bathroom vent extremely noisy and impossible to switch off too loud to sleep at night and finally on the next night we found a half dead cockroach lying in the bathtub photo enclosed all in all a disgrace
