air conditioning is weak think it is affected by the spotlights which is warming up the room the light system seem to be either having two modes so either all off or on ended had to only use the bedside light to allow the aircon to cool the room no slippers provided in the room can get a bit noisy with the busy traffic outside but to be fair i think this is for all properties in the area
