we were offered an upgrade for a small sum and decided to take it we were surprised with the slightly shabby appearance of the room and wondered what the previous room would have been like if this was an upgrade there was cigarette burns in the curtains the desk was dusty and the drawer labelled hairdryer was missing it s key ingredient we called housekeeping to get a hairdryer and after phone calls and a visit from maintenance to fix the none existent hairdryer a trip to the consierge and an hour later we finally got a working hairdryer if we were staying there for longer we would have asked to move rooms
