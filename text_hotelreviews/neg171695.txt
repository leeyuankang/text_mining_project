checked in late as the room wasn t originally ready the first time air conditioning wasn t working the thermostat was physically broken and obviously had been for months at first the duty manager couldn t be bothered to deal with it at all eventually he came up and refused us a replacement room although it was obviously broken after much fuss he eventually arranged for a portable air conditioner which basically didn t work just kept stopping and starting noisily so we turned it off next morning i noticed the safety test certificate was two months out of date illegally so i checked the kettle the next morning and it was over a year out of date again illegally the manager that night didn t give a damn next morning at reception i found myself next to someone else with exactly the same issue except he had been given a replacement room although he was complaining it wasn t much better so the duty manager lied about no available rooms receptionist next morning basically said it happens all the time the place is a dump even if anything had been working or legally certified it would only rate star not the four they claim avoid this place or get what you deserve from a management who don t care
