there was no room available when i arrived at i had to wait for minutes not good enough the air conditioning unit was very noisy and it didn t work no difference at all to the temparture during a london heat wave i was better to open the window the heated towel rail clearly connected to power supply with a thermostat although not needed by me because of the heat had a sign next to it saying please note this is not a heated towel rail in other words they couldn t be bothered repairing whatever fault there was in the heated rail
