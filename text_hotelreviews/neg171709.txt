i requested a wake up call that didn t come my tv didn t work properly i reported it but no one came to fix it that i know of at check out i spoke to the guest rep and she apologized and said she would look into it and email me upon my return to the states i had an email stating they would upgrade me to a more expensive room on my next visit well that s all well and good but i m not planning a return visit and if she had asked me she would have known that this was my most costly booking and to be fair given the location i think it was relatively inexpensive but in retrospect i enjoyed my stays in smaller guest houses where the host and hostess really go out of their way to make you feel at home and provide you with whatever you need and in all cases with less means
