we booked at the millennium gloucester hotel during london s recent heat wave because they indicate on booking com that all their rooms have air con in our room our air con was not working it blew loudly but no cold air came out the hotel reception area was well air conditioned there was no hairdryer in the room even though there is a drawer clearly marked hairdryer and no bathrobes provided given the room prices i would expect these facilities as a minimum
