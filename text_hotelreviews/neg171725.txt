was charged for the room at the time of booking as my credit card had expired and replaced with a new one by the time i got there the hotel charged me again for the three night stay on my new credit card they said it is highlighted on the small prints of booking com if the card has expired even if the payment has already been taken they have to charge for the full amount again for security reasons will now have to wait for a refund which will take a long time as the card has expired wlll not recommend using booking com and the milldnium hotel
