having stayed here nearly every time we come to the uk i can honestly say this time was the worst experience ever and the worst hotel ever on holiday i don t get paid to have to put up with hassle and stress as i do when working first day and paying extra for a clubroom we seem to have paid extra for shoddy services and accommodation falty towers has nothing on this nowhere to plug in kettle or computer in the designated area due to all power points having a plastic panel over them tv channel was not loud enough to hear when window was open only bath towel between two of us the ac was on the max setting and not very cold the sink plug was permanently stuck in the basin so water did not drain the hair dryer heat setting was broken the toilet flush could have been better the bathroom painted wooden panel below the sink was chipped we were told we had a great big lovely bed yes but quality of mattress was really bad if one person turned over the whole mattress vibrated the whole room smelt of gone off arm pits the bathroom hot water tap had to be turned with a towel as if it had not been used in ages i also asked for an additional tissue box in the room the next morning we lodged all the complaints no real apologies ended up speaking to people we told them to fix everything whilst we were out or when we came back to the hotel later to change our room when we returned reception said that they had done everything my husband was not convinced that they had done everything so asked for reception to come to the room with us again more hassle had to wait for the guy the only thing they had done was to fix the basin tv tissue box and towel
