room was dated heavy dust over the top of the very tall headboard maid would need to stand on the bed to clean so do it the vinyl chair was worn on the arms and seat and was sticky needs to be replaced two teabags pack of biscuits for two guests carpet old the air con was loud and when the curtains were drawn at night they didn t reach the walls so wide bands of light shone through at that s not good in my opinion the entire room needed completely updating if i could go back and start again i would definitely ask to change rooms
