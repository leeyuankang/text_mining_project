no mini bar no red bush tea available we had to go to tescos across the road to buy some biscuits on the tea and coffee tray not topped up breakfast rather disappointing limited selection of cereals pancakes did not taste as i expected we asked for decaf coffee and soya milk in the bar on our first evening none available we were given a discount on the price of our coffee and liquers at checkout to compensate for this room was functional clean and tidy
