the room the first room i walked into smelt like someone had been smoking in there the carpet had stains all over it and the bathroom was basic nothing like the pictures make it look like the wooden tv cabinet and the like had mug stains all over them and were very unappealing the deal breaker for me was the seamen stain on the corner of one of the bed bases i walked down and asked for a refund and to go elsewhere as this was booked through booking com they could not do this they upgraded me to a satisfactory room which still looked outdated the only nice thing was the bathroom in this one my room was also only made up on one of the days i stayed despite leaving a make me up sign on the outside of the door wouldn t stay again ever the rating on booking com swayed me to book this place next time i ll do more research
