the club room we stayed in was old and in serious need of an upgrade especially the cramped bathroom that didn t have a walk in shower i was told that only the rooms for physically challenged guests had walk in showers by far the poorest club room i ve stayed in any hotel the room service indian curry was disappointingly small and i couldn t charge it to my room despite them having my credit card there was no reasonable provision of electric sockets to charge our phones and laptops as in modern hotels it took days to get a very short extension socket the aircon fan was noisy and the tv was strangely hard to turn on the club lounge was small and dingy mainly providing tea and coffee and was unstaffed when we went i was unclear if the staff were interested in the needs of their guests or just unable to help as the hotel was inadequately resourced to cap off the experience when i picked up my luggage from storage in the afternoon i couldn t open my tsa lock and it had to be broken open when paying over per night your stay shouldn t be tolerated but enjoyed when you can finally find a manager they do seem service orientated but not at any staff level below that i would advise more investment training and a change of culture
