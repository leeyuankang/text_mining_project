out nights there were noises in the corridor loud discussions when passing by altercations including one assault and loud phone calls which made us have a poor night sleep i am unsure what the hotel can do about this but the clientele was not particularly considerate or at least some of them were not this was not expected in a hotel that feels rather like a luxury hotel most clients certainly looked wealthy
