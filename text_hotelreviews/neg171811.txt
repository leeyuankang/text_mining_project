i booked a standard twin room and the hotel does have an offer to upgrade to the club room either club lounge breakfast or only breakfast i wanted to have a look at the standard room before i can decide if i need the upgrade to club room and the front desk was telling me they do not have the availability of the standard room and then later she asked the manager on duty night and the manager said if i go to view the standard room and the offer will be lapsed of course this is a surprise to me that millennium gloucester road is having this policy and also running out of already booked room somehow later they show me a standard room now they have the room in the first floor near the road they said this is the last room usually hotel will not let occupancy for emergency purposes where i did not have a good sleep and wake up every hour in the night they have one row of rooms in that area and if you stay in the hotel good luck bad management not friendly with not objective to make the guest stay feel like home i would recommend millennium copthorn tara instead as the practice in millennium gloucester road is ridiculous
