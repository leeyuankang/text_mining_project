we didn t like things the hotel is located at the west side of london while we liked more the east side so it was a lot of traveling by subway it s not the hotel fault though at first night we got a room for disabled persons though we didn t asked for that the room was not good to us and we had to stay with our luggage enclosed till we replaced the room to a regular room
