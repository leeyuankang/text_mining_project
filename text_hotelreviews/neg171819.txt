the hotel room was not great the room cleaning staff were not attentive at all at one point we ran out of toilet paper they didn t replace it when they cleaned the room it then took phone calls and hrs to get some delivered the room maintenance was also very poor we have a number of light globes out in the bathroom but after numerous requests they were never replaced the thermostat didn t work when we arrived to overcome this they just gave us a portable aircon but never fixed it and never offered to move us to another room will never go back
