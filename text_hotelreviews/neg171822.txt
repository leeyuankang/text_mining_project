unfortunately an irresponsible guest let his room flood from falling asleep while running a bath this flooded our room around midnight we had to stay in our flooded carpets around one side of our bed until we could move rooms in the morning i did think however it was unprofessional and not good customer service to not have one of the management team see we were all right with our room move this has left a poor view of the hotel and may influence a future stay which would be unfortunate as we stay at this hotel a lot when in london
