we had stays in this hotel over the weeks we were in london and in the first stay we were roomed on the floor in the furthest corner of the hotel the room was small and it needed to be updated renovated when we were coming back for nights i spoke to the duty manager about the room we had had before and he found us a better room for our longer stay this was greatly appreciated between our stays we requested our suitcases be stored for days even though we were coming back to stay nights the hotel charged us a daily fee per luggage piece to store the luggage i have never had that happen in any hotel in all my years of travel the reason given is that the hotel had very limited space for storage
