one of the worst hotels i ve been to ever in fact it is the worst hotel i ve been to i lost the tag of my luggage and the concierge guy started shouting at me and refused to let me see which bag is mine even though i explained to him the shape of my bag and its color when i tried to explain to him that i lost the luggage tag he started mumbling and making fun of me he was the most disrespectful person i have ever seen the cab was waiting outside and i needed to leave to the airport and he still refused to find a solution and was acting as cold as he could be and keep on telling me that it is my fault not his well we are not discussing who s fault it is i just need the bag moreover the room was dirty and the bed sheet as well definitely not recommended going to london next week again and definitely will stay in a different hotel
