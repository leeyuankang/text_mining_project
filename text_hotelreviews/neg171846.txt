had asked for a quiet room and was put in a room facing inwards however there was a party going on in the function room which our room overlooked the party ended at am which was fine but the staff clearing up until kept us awake even though i complained to them twice and reception once they were dragging furniture and bins clattering bottles and talking loudly which was all very annoying and stressful i complained again in the morning and wrote to them when i got home i got an apology but that was all
