the heater in my room was very loud and didn t seem to work at all so the whole night was very cold the next morning i went down to the reception to ask for a new room or someone to go fix it the reception staff told me that he will send someone to check it very soon i waited in my room for over mins and no one came so i had to go down to the reception area again after talking to another staff she immediately allocated me to a new upgraded room i was disappointed at the first staff i talked to about how he just forgot about me and my issue
