the standard rooms have not been updated in a very long time i am certain they were nice at one time in the distant past but cracked bathroom tiles heavily discoloured sink bath big chunks chipped out of the granite tiles and sink unit the room was just about adequate and a very good size but everything in it from the carpets to the bed fittings curtains etc were all very dated we prefer classic styling to modern but just not when it is years and years old
