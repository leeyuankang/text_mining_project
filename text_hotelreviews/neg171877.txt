booking com asked if we would like to add breakfast which we did online when we came to the hotel they told us that booking com did not control this or take the money for it we had to pay at the hotel which was not clearly highlighted as we thought the breakfast payment was taken with our online booking however this wasn t the hotels fault they were very reassuring when explaining this mishap
