awful and the most uncomfortable stay the room was very cold i couldn t sleep and they couldn t do anything about it fire alarm goes on and everyone panicked and got to the lobby then they say its just a mistake for our lobby candles and it might happen again and even didn t apologize checking in was a long process because they didn t have the reservation information in the system the bed was the most uncomfortable bed never going back
