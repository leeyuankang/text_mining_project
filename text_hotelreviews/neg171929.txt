rooms very out dated and need a major overhaul we stayed in the regency suite and what is meant to be a high end room was very poor mini bar not stock nor was the coffee or tea facilities room was cold lack of spare blankets or dressing gowns just the little things that are usually standard in the millennium hotel group very disappointed
