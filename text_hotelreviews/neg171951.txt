i had to report faulty lights in the room one i considered to be quite dangerous and also the bathroom door could not be locked my friends room had a broken drawer in the wardrobe after reporting it to reception the lights were dealt with also the tea tray and kettle were very awkward to use due to the combination and location of plugs and sockets and not very user friendly particularly for elderly guests however these little problems would not prevent me from visiting again
