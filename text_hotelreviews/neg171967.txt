requested a quiet room but we had one on the corner of the building with a cross roads outside and a mini roundabout so traffic noise was bad the fire alarm went off twice and when we used the fire escape at the back of the hotel there was no staff to inform us what was happening we had to walk round to the front of the hotel to find out that it was someone smoking in a room the same thing happened the next morning
