our room cards didn t work and no one explained to us that you needed it for the lift so we tried several lifts and eventually got to our floor by someone else s efforts when we got to the room the key didn t work obviously the lift problem i was with my year old granddaughter and we had to negotiate the lifts again with our bags to go back to reception we got an apology but it was quite tiresome
