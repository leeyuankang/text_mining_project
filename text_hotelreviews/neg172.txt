hotel under sonstruction which we weren t aware of when we arrived there was no rooms for us they asked upon arrival if all of us would share a room which wasn t something we were prepared to do we booked separate rooms for a reason we booked double deluxe rooms but ended up being put in twin rooms which over looking the building site over all not worth the pound that was spent
