the rooms are a desaster dunno how could uk tourism give this hotel a stars rate strating from the lits to the coridor carpet to the room that all makes u feel we are in the even there is no light in the room as in the ceiling only side light wanted to wear my socks had to switch on the light of my mobile to see the color the wc is since the furniture is tooooo old what a shame of being rate stars i would say stars is the max this hotel should be rates you see the pictures at booking com it s trick they do u sure i wouldn t recommend anyone decent to go stay there
