not so impressed by service at breakfast as it was difficult to order tea and coffee and finished plates not cleared that quickly i think water should be available in the room as we were stopped from taking our glasses of water up and had to pay room service charge for water delivered to room the food was odd on day of ukiscrs event with odd tastes together and tough beef which we had to wait to be replenished as people had taken the meat only and left the vegetable part of it and it stayed like that for a while
