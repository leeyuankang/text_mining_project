i have booked a spacious room as advertized on booking com the first receptionist male gave me a tiny room facing the walls of a neighbouring building with no sun or air and located at the end of a long corridor though i told him i want a big room with a reasonable view i couldnt stay there for more sec exactly room in or floor i informed the second receptionist who was a nice lady and she changed it to a club room in floor with half window view but much better than first one otherwise everything was great recommended and will book there again
