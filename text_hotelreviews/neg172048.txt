booked a room for my husband and i and a room for our friends was told when we checked in that our rooms were on the same floor and next to each other this was not the case it was on the same floor but opposite side of building ours was ok our friends room was a meeting room with a very large desk and a very low pull out bed so asked to change room and was told that there was only one other room which was on the third floor wasn t happy but no option was disgusted at the first room it wasn t nice at all this was booked at full price and well in advance rooms were dated supposed to be star but the rooms let it down also the bedroom fire alarm went off early morning but nobody came to check to make sure everything was alright and we were safe bit concerning had no idea why it went off as we are non smokers and no reason why it would didn t like the fact there was a mouse running around in the bar area when reported to staff they said they were waiting for guests to leave to sort the problem which was fair wouldn t recommend this hotel
