before we arrived i requested an upgrade to a club room and i prepaid there was a lot of confusion at reception eventually got a superior room on the floor i tried times to correct this but gave up i had a look at the club lounge and it was definitely not worth it in any case i can t comment on the club rooms i received some credit back when i checked out which i appreciated very bad wifi connection in the room breakfast buffet was average but a star should at least give you an option to order freshly cooked eggs i would not use this hotel again
