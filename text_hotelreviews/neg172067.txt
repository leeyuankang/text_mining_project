the room recommended to us by booking com is standard two single bed room we are a family of four who with young children i guess people could to put the beds together to make a big double bed however the beds in this hotel was standard small single in my eyes beds even to push two bed together it would be very big anyway it s lucky that two of our children is very young otherwise it s no way to sleep in this room i guess i mistaken these room with a modern two big single beds room so do be careful if you are booking for a family two adults with two children the hotel is very old and dated but the size of the room and facility was good so no complaint there
