disappointing service for a hotel rooms were not cleaned or made up during the day check in staff were neither welcoming nor friendly i was disappointed to be expected to pay for my stay on arrival rather than on check out the all night party in the room next door was ridiculously noisy it subsided for a while after i d called reception but soon resumed how can that many people fit into a double room
