i was told at midnight upon check in there was no room as there had been a flood and they would have to transfer me to another hotel then i was told they did have a room but it was a twin disabled room the standard was poor that said i did get complimentary breakfast and parking so do feel they did their best to apologies i was not too pleased at first but overall it wasn t so bad it was mainly the fact we didn t have a double bed
