i stayed at this hotel times over the last years this last few weeks being the fourth time i kept going back because of its location this last stay was in august all the others were feb march april and i saw a major major difference in staff friendliness room readiness and service my stay in august was horrible to say the least we moved our rooms times in the first day and a half because the ac didn t work the taps didn t work there was no hot water and mainly because i had requested connected rooms and upon arrival there were non available so we had to wait for a room to free up and even when we settled in a room we had to replace the blow dryers because they were not working and the kettles twice because they leaked the people who cleaned the room and the porters who carried the bags were very friendly the reception staff was not friendly neither were some of the concierge staff they didn t want to make much effort to help with requests i left knowing i would never return to this hotel again they blamed booking com for issues related to payment at checkout and for connected room request i would not advise anyone to go in the summer months
