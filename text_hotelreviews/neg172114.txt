allocated room was not cleaned and prepared for us once we got to the room but staff were very apologetic and upgraded our room to a club room immediately for the incovenience also booked through booking com and paid for breakfast for our day stay booking com failed to alert the hotel to this once i had recognised we were being charged again for breakfast alerted this to reception they said this hapoems with booking com from time to time where they pocket the extra and put it down as a room only as the full price you had paid they were very understanding and just added it to our booking immediately and without question rooms are in need of updating and tidying up a little but at per room per night for the hotel with its good location is very much value for money
