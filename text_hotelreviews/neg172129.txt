upon arrival we were told the type of room we booked and per paid double was not available at the price we paid after finally agreeing to paying additional cost we got our room but had to pay an additional cost above the reservation cost we also had to pay additional for internet and breakfast the internet was the worst and the breakfast was not worth the additional cost we extended our stay because the location was near the train and this was excellent for getting around the city when we returned home i found two charges for the additional stay i spoke with the clerk twice to verify that the one day was cancelled and re booked for an additional four days the problem is i am billed twice for the same room i have not been able to get my money back i would really appreciate the hotel making this correction by submitting the proper credit to my american express the hotel had at lease three fire drills during our stay one required us to walk down four flights of stairs to exit the building and the other happen late at night we were greeted by a staff person informing us that it was a false alarm
