rooms are dark and dated the check in took over minutes with only staff on desk not what you want after hours travel the internet connection was very poor and kept disconnecting every minutes a service for which they charge an additional pounds a day for the car park below the hotel is handy even at pounds per day but again has to be paid for daily at the check in desk which meant more queuing at the understaffed front desk i stayed for days traveling away from london for nights to return and find the room hadn t been cleaned whilst away i decided to stay in london another week but am now in the crowne plaza across the road which is comparible in price but a hundred times better value for money i have been traveling around the world for the last years staying at accommodation ranging from a beach hut with no front door in thailand to the top hotels on victoria harbour yet this is the first review i have written as it is such poor value for money
