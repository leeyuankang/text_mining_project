the members of staff that i had interaction with from my initial phone call to even booking in was terrible it basically came down to them not knowing there job or the hotel policy s i booked the room for me and my wife my wife would be turning up early due to my business commitments i was told she would not be able to book in until i turned up because i used my credit card details it wasn t until a good later when o requested a manager that the matter was cleared up and my wife was allowed to check in without me being present once at the hotel when i finally got there was a charge to my credit card because i had booked through booking com i was told if i didn t pay it there would be a charge at the end i asked why and all i got was because that s how it is disgusting
