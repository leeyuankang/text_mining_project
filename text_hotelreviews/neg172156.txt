the water in the bathroom on the club floor was steaming hot and after informing the housekeeper and she then said she would tell the maintenance guys to look at the problem nothing was done to change the thermostat control and the following morning the water was still boiling hot and that meant you could not stand under the shower head and have a shower even after setting the thermostat control to less than degrees still didn t bring on any cold water dreadful experience wifi didn t work properly either
