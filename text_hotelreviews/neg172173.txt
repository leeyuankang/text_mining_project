disappointed with the size of the club lounge there are clearly too many club rooms for the lounge to accommodate some guests were unable to find a seat on friday evening and saturday morning breakfast the club lounge also ran out of canape and breakfast on friday eve and saturday morning i thought the service hours of drinks in the club lounge were too restricted staff in the lounge were very helpful but clearly restricted by the rules and quickly hid the gin bottle at the end of the time
