i booked a twin room as i was here with a family member the receptionist looked concerned when i said i didn t want the double that she was offering we ended up in a twin room single beds pushed together usually reserved for disabled guests which meant no bath that i could live with but the room was basic pokey and shabby with broken drawers no kettle or hairdryer we were transferred to another twin room on the second night and the standard was appreciably higher and appropriate to the s we d paid we accepted the offer of free breakfasts but i do think they d overbooked and as i d made my booking a month in advance i found this irritating
