the original room rate didnt include wifi which is very unusual these days to charge pounds for wifi for night was exorbitant in the end we just went for the pound upgrade to include the breakfast and wifi but we felt that was a bit of a ploy by the hotel to get a better rate than advertised as well as that the wifi was a bit hard to log on to as the instructions given by reception didn t work exactly why not make it better and provide wifi for free in the original advertised rate
