no facilities at all after midnight for residents when the bar closed not even a coffee reception was confusing at check in and check out the room seemed a little tired but thats being picky my colleagues also had room problems such as no lighting at all in one room no hot water in another and room entry key failure on arrival in a third in total we occupied rooms i think they need to try harder
