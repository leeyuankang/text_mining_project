truly awful room on floor dark old and worn furnishings everything had seen better days and looked like it needed a scrub clean so disappointing as had taken a friend to london for a fun night out and this room was an embarrassment not star standard and far too expensive for the state no free wifi which is ridiculous for a hotel of this supposed level i stayed in hotels in london this week and this was by far the worst receptionist said they are in the process of a refurbishment but don t charge those prices if the room is so crap would not go back
