sadly my room wasn t like the photos at all and overall more sad looking than the common areas of the hotel first of all if you are over meters and assuming all the rooms are the same the shower will not work for you i m and the base of the shower head came at my chin i had to do some cirque du soleil acrobatics to clean my hair this isn t an adjustable sprayer like most places but a fixed showerhead i had a giant sticky spot of goo on the carpeting that housekeeping had clearly ignored for ages it was so gross and wore shoes the entire time after discovering this when my foot was stuck to the floor the blinds were broken and didn t close all the way so the bright morning light streamed in the room itself had very dim lighting and would have benefited from a central bright ceiling fixture the other guests and staff were incredibly loud in the hallways in addition my room was located adjacent to their conservatory event space when the event was over around the staff was incredibly loud and clanking and banging what i m assuming were chairs and tables for an hour or so on morning a manager and her staff member decided to have an impromptu meeting at am directly outside my door
