we originally booked nights then added a night the hotel staff told me our two bookings would be combined at check in so we would not have to switch rooms between our and nights upon check in this was not the case our first room was a standard room our sexond was an upgraded room i thought the standard room was far superior to the upgrade and having to change rooms from a queen bed into a two twin bed room at twice the price made for a bad experience i told the front desk i would prefer to pay the upgrade price and remain in our standard room but he declined to help me keep my room staff was friendly and helpful but this room change issue was a bad experience especially after the telephone agent said that we would not have to switch rooms
