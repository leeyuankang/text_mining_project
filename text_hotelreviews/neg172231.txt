i didn t like the fact that because i had booked through booking com to prove that i had actually stayed there my debit card has been charged i was not explained that this would happen either when checking in or checking out i only noticed days later on my bank statement i know it was only but it could have been for more and i would not have known if i hadn t checked my statement that payment went through without my knowledge
