as i waited for a business colleague in the lobby i was looked upon with suspicion three times members of the staff approached me to ask me questions like are you waiting for someone do you live here can i help you the tone of the questions and the looks on their faces was full of prejudice and stereotypes that made me feel very uncomfortable i will never stay there again
