we were offered an upgrade which included larger room breakfast and internet access the internet access didn t work until the evening the breakfast was very poor and extremely poor value the air conditioning came on am and sounded like an aircraft taking off we couldn t turn it off and had to call the night staff to the night porters credit he sorted the problem out but by that time it was for a hotel of this supposed quality i can t believe how many times we complained about things in the end they knocked off the extra we had paid for the upgrade which was poor considering avoid room with the extra loud air conditioning i refuse to accept that the hotel are not aware of this problem from previous occupants of this room as the noise and vibration is unbearable definitely wont be staying here again
