we were placed in a room for the first night right next to the staff entrance woken up at by lots of noise we requested to move rooms and were moved to a much better room the breakfast cost is extremely expensive for what it was plenty of cafes and restaurants in the area who will serve a breakfast cheaper i added to notes about my husbands birthday and we had no acknowledgement at all this would have made our stay feel a lot more welcoming
