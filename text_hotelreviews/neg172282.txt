the location is great the concierge was helpful but the rest of the staff acted as tired as the decor the room was massive which gave us more space to see it had not been cleaned and smelled of old cigarettes this was not helped by staff smoking outside the bedroom window in the middle of the night we asked for adjoining room we did not get them we asked for baby cots we did not get them and had to ask a number of times before they arrived this was nice as we checked in at midnight and had very tired babies we tired to boil water for the babies night time feed the kettle leaked poaring water all over the desk and kettle didn t leak but it did cause a power outage in the room we i asked why the room had not been serviced by nearly in the afternoon i was given the answer i don t know i have stayed here before as the location is very good but i would be hard pushed to stay there again and i would not recommend it
