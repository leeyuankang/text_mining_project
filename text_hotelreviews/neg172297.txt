the reception my friend paid using his credit card as it was non refundable booking and it was charge few days prior our arrival however the receptionist insisted that i have to have the same card or pay cash despite paying cash my friend card was charged again for to secure a phone call how cheap is this when i questioned them they said it will be refunded when i checkout my argument now if they did not honour the card at checkin how cheeky of them to charge again
