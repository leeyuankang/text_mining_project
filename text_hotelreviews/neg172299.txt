poor service by extremely miserable staff made a booking for a double room but was told they only had twins when i said needed a double karen whilst shrugging shoulders asked what do you want me to do instead had to pay an extra fee for a superior room when we entered the room the bathroom had water all over the floor and the room smelt really bad requested a change of room however this room had no working air con even though it was outside at around midnight the fire alarms went off and everyone was evacuated to reception area and the alarm was a false alarm at checkout i was further told that the air con system had been down and that they were aware of the issue no one thought to tell the guests this upon check in really disappointed at this hotel as have stayed here numerous times definitely would not recommend unless you want to waste your money
