one of our party had to change rooms as the widow was poorly fitted leaving the room cold and breezy at first the hotel wanted them to pay for an upgrade after a chat with the manager they didn t have to pay disgusting treatment bar staff rude and abrupt seemed too much like hard work to serve us finally did after waiting around mins each time chamber maids as always with the foreign staff rude breakfast was a rip off poor quality chicken sausages and turkey bacon this is england not the middle east the hotel didn t at all cater for english people we didn t get a choice of real sausages or bacon other than the receptionist the rest of the staff didn t make us feel at all welcome seems they are only interested in pleasing the wealthy arabs using the hotel
