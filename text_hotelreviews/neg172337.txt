when we checked in we were told we had booked a standard double no breakfast and an easter promotion was then being sold to us to have us pay for breakfast however i had booked a double club room including breakfast but the check in lady didn t seem interested and continued her sales pitch only when i told her that i know what i had paid and i would not pay again did she finally check my confirmation on my phone it did turn out that the booking was there apparently mistakes happen when using other sites we were told but no apology offered at all quite stressful
