the only negative thing i could say is the access to pin sockets in the room there were sockets but all in really awkward places low down or under a desk in the corner and none by either side of the bed lockers in these days of mobile phone etc charging i was surprised on the club floor there appear to be renovations going on so it s a little disconcerting to see guys gowned up with masks walking along with dusty bags
