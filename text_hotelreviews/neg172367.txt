the room was disappointing very tired looking with dented furniture and cracked tiles in the bathroom tissue only left in the tissue box and one milk carton empty and no breakfast teabags before we even started using the facilities this led me to doubt how well the room is actually prepared between guests on departure we asked a very smiley and undoubtedly friendly member of staff about express check out his knowledge of english however was very poor and he unable to understand a simple and standard hotel request which did nothing to support my previous impression of the hotel created on a visit years previously
