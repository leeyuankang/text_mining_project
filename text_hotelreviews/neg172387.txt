there was a terrible mold smell on the corridors there was no bin in the room there was not enough toiletries in the bathroom despite the fact that the booking was for two people on a superior room the staff in the breakfast room don t know how to clean tables or chairs the same cloth is used for table and chairs when they manage to do the odd chair cross contamination however the seats are not cleaned and everything cleaned from the tables lands on the floor that s poor practice
