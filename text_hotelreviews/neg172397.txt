i didn t particular like anything about the hotel i think there is far better for the same price my bed wasn t even a proper one it had been pulled down out of the closet and the room in general very shabby bar area was tatty and the night i was there had kids running all over the bar area throwing themselves on the floor not a relaxing experience in a hotel bar
