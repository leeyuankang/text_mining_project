the room was comfortable but in need of a refurb particularly the bathroom which was a little tired and dated the shower was temperamental and difficult to control and one of the sink taps had seen better days there was no hotel guide or room service menu in the room and it was impossible for anyone to tell me where i could get a bottle of water to take up to my room at as all the facilities were shut i have stayed here before but was unfortunately a little disappointed by a few minor things this time
