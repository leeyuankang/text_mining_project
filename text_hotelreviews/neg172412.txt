i upgraded my room for a suite and was offered a good price for that room the room itself was great very roomy and well furnished however i have to say that the room was cold despite using the in room heating and the windows in the bedroom and living room area were poorly fitted with a lot of cold air coming through also the shower cubicle was way too small
