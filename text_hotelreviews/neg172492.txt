i didnt think the hotel room was acceptable i had no lights on the ceiling apart from lamp so the lighting was really bad i think the value of money that i paid for the room was poor i did leave a comment when booking the hotel to make it special for my partner as a surprise and no notice was taken of that the room was rather small where the hotel is located i thought the rooms would be amazing but i was very disappointed the only part i loved was the reception area it was a shame i couldnt just lay my bed there also the fire alarm went off which ruined it even more as i was not fully dressed to run out the hotel did nothing at all apart from saying sorry on the tv screen which is unacceptable
