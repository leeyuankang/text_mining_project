on arrival we was met by a very polite friendly and helpful member off staff and was offered an upgrade off for a bigger room free wi fi and breakfast for both mornings unfortunately we couldn t get any wifi in the room and only connected around the lobby area when arriving for breakfast we was told that the main room was full and was seated in a smaller room where all the food was stone cold after asking for a pot off tea and waiting approx minutes for it that came out warm we was so disappointed we opted to have breakfast across the road in a patisserie the following day
