the first room we got probably the worst room of the hotel we can hear some noise from door opening closing all day all night aircon really loud noise toilet did not flush properly in bedroom more than light bulbs did not work which make a room really dim the second night we ask for a room change on a higher floor and non of that problems remain and we were happy also no free internet in the room only in the lobby
