for this category of hotel and price range both the rooms and bathrooms need to be updated we stayed in room club where the temperature was a staggering c the technician adjusted it but said it would take a few hours to cool down in fact it took days to cool down to an acceptable level a portable air conditioning unit was provided but it was so noisy we couldn t use it the wifi connection was very erratic also we noticed a slight deterioration in the quality of breakfast in comparison to previous years
