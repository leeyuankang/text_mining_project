the room was just ok but not up to a star standard no shaver points in bathroom the reaction of staff to most things was very defensive we had suffered from an attempt at a payment scam before visit staff made us feel it was our fault and created even more problems on arrival as they then without asking credited a cancelled credit card then insisted we repay with our new credit card have at the present paid twice as it will take at least two to three weeks for my bank to process the credit to my cancelled credit card with all the problems they created would have expected a sorry hope you have a nice stay
