breakfast was not included my extractor fan would not turn off i asked for maintenance to check it returned hours later at but it was still loud i rang down but no one came the reception told me in the morning they couldn t fix it so why didn t someone have the courtesy to leave a note to say that offer me a replacement room better still offer to come up with the key if i wanted to swap that would have been service
