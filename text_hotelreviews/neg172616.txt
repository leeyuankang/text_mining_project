i am not critical and really just giving feedback there seemed little to the hotel other than the room it lacked character and i did not feel any urge to sit and relax go to the bar go to a lounge there didn t seem to be one with a few newspapers etc for a hotel of that quality it lacked that bit extra my wife was there several hours before me and would have liked somewhere to go she went out to find a coffee shop
