i had booked a standard double room as we were only in london for one night in order to attend a black tie event in kensington the first room we were offered was very small and very cramped there was not enough room for us both to get ready at all on complaining at reception we were given a much more spacious room by a different member of staff who acknowledged that the initial room was not a good one at all
