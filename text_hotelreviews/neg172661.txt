we had a power failure in our room which they failed to fix and when we returned we had lost all power and had to get ready for a special occasion in the dark and the staff did not seem too concerned to help a different room was offered but too late we have also been charged for a restaurant bill which we don t know about and also charged for car parking twice we are currently liaising with the accounts department to sort this out
