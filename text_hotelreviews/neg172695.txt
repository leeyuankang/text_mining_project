for such an expensive hotel i was surprised by the bad service in the bar ordered food and we had to wait ages for the waiter to come back to us and by the time he did we just wanted the condiments we had practically finished we only had enough for one cup of coffee in our room and just two biscuits on the first day an none on the second the mini bar was also empty when paying such a lot i think you could expect much more
