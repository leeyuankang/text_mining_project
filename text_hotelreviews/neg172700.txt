the fact that i had booked this hotel as a single female traveller for nights due to it being directly across from gloucester rd tube station all confirmed to arrive and find that there was no room available meaning i was moved to the fulham road hotel this was tube stops further away from the city and as i was not comfortable walking the minutes from the tube to the hotel at night had to spend more money on taxis
