i believe that we must have been given the worst room in the hotel it had little natural light with a small window looking onto some sort of central utility area the available lighting in the room was not good enough to read by the carpet had a large thread pulled in the middle of the floor but worst of all and my main complaint the bathroom was dirty and unhygienic with a lump of chewing gum stuck on the floor and large quantities of someone else s hair on the floor in the bath and filling the bath outlet i took photos clearly there was a general lack of care we would never stay there again we did complain at check out and asked to speak to the manager a young man who was apparently in charge was pleasant and apologetic and did not charge us for the two drinks that we had at the bar the night before however in the circumstances i would have expected that he offer an immediate refund when i raised this the young man advised that he was not authorised to do that but that he would pass on my complaint to his superior i have yet to hear back this is the second bad experience that we have had when booking on line
