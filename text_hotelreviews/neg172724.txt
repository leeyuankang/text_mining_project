i am disabled and the reception staff wanted us to move to another hotel a considerable distance away because they had overbooked hotel i told the frosty faced supervisor that was not happening we then had to take the disabled room which we were told was near a lift this was a lie it was the furthest possible distance from the lift bad start to our visit the breakfast was disgusting it was like a cattle market we ended up eating out for breakfast half the staff did not understand a word of english we have stayed in the knickerbocker in chicago which is a millenium hotel and the experience was like night and day we will never go back to this hotel
