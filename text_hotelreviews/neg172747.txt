when we checked in our room was not ready and to make matters worse the extra bed i had booked and paid for for my son to sleep in was not available we were given a room eventually and when we got there the bed was not there a phone call from reception told us that we had to move rooms so we could get the extra bed in we did move again reluctantly went out for the day only to return at with still no bed after frustrating phone calls the bed arrived at and by this time my child was asleep in ours i know this could have been a simple mistake in reservations and i dont usually complain but for a four star hotel the problem should have been rectified immediately especially as a family with a small child is it not the sole purpose of booking a hotel to have a bed to sleep in
