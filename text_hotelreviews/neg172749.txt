there was only one uk plug socket in the room all the others were international having travelled from the north west we didn t take adapter plugs i spoke with reception four times regarding this matter and the situation was never resolved at one point i was asked to purchase an adapter plug from concierge at a cost of which i refused to do given the fact my appliances had uk plugs and the hotel is in the uk this was a huge inconvenience to our trip and resulted in us being unable to charge phones to take photographs
