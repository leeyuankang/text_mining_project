we checked in at about and l paid upfront even though the concierge said to me that l could pay later but l insisted because we had to go to into the city and l was trying to avoid long queues on our arrival back to the hotel we arrived at and headed to the reception only to be given keys to a double room even though they had taken an extra pounds from me for a family room i had to call the reception giving them an ultimatum of either refunding back my money or changing our rooms after minuttes one of the staff came upstairs to escort us to a family room it was very tiring especially since we had been out all day also we paid for internet and had no wifi i had to call the reception times and l was asked if l had paid for internet it is absurd that they have problems distinguishing between paid and unpaid guests eventually the wifi was connected shortly after midnat
