the good thing that the club rooms has thier own club lounge for breakfast buffet and its not crowded but i didn t like the idea in the club lounge that the breakfast dosent have the full portions like the breakfast for the standard rooms i mean we payed more then the standard rooms so we deserve the best services more so my suggestion is to improve and put the full portion of breakfast in the club lounge like the one in the ground floor for the people who has a standard room
