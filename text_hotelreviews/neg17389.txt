only complaint was it was my new wife and i were on honeymoon i emailed ahead a few times about getting some champagne and stuff in the room for our arrival and got no reply and there was a questionnaire before arrival that asked reason of stay i put honeymoon and we were put in a twin room it was lovely but not ideal
