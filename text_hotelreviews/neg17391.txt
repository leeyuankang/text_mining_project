the room was extra small we called booking com to cancel last days of one room which they did and helped us supposedly at no charge but that room now was charged euros more breakfast was now included and awful and our relatives did not want the front desk person was not nice and was quite rude maybe because we were americans the second room was nice and the manager helped us with that we would stay there again now that we know what to expect
