nice hotel the first room we got was very small and the next one the bathroom was dirty the room was great so what they say all good things come in three the reception was super friendly however the breakfast stuff was unacceptable she did not speak english and gave you the feeling you are not welcome you had to ask for everything as the buffet was empty no bread cheese etc not what you expect from a first class hotel
