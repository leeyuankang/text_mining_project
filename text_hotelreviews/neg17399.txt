this hotel did not offer the experience i was expecting the room was extremely small and there was a very small closet in the room which barely was able to fit my suit the sauna is at best a person sauna and that is stretching it they even charged us for the coffee in the lobby while we waited i am not sure why this hotel is rated as star this was a standard or maybe a star experience
