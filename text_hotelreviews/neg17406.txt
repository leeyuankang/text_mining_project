our stay was adequate but there are some serious issues with customer service firstly i was nearly charged for an early check in when i simply asked for my partner s name to be added to the booking not an early check in time secondly we asked on six separate occasions for a larger size of slipper on every occasion we were told they were on their way immediately and they never arrived and i was there for four nights if no larger sizes were available it would have been polite to inform me of this instead of ignoring my request every time thirdly the bath plug was broken and the sink tap was faulty so we had to change rooms just an hour after arriving and unpacking
