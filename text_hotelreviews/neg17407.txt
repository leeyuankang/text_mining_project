water was not draining properly in the shower so had to stop the shower twice before finishing my shower problem reported to the maid but nothing happened so this is not what you expect from a five start hotel also breakfast was terrible compared to a year ago when i stayed around the time they first open so not sure if things are going down i invited people for breakfast and they were not happy so made me a bit uncomfortable to the credit of the front desk she took off one breakfast out of three i would have been happy to pay and get the breakfast i had one year ago at the hotel
