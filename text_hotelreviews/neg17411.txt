the hotel doesn t have a very friendly welcome we expected them to serve us some drinks or snacks a gesture that a professional stars hotel would normally have instead we had to do it by ourselves perhaps we re quite picky when it comes to hotel services the housekeeping staff was very unprofessional she didn t know anything in the room e g when i asked the staff if i can change the sparkling water bottle to mineral water bottle she looked at me very confused and shaked her head and when she finally understood what i was talking about she was pretty annoyed that i requested a different type of water bottle not enough of complimentary items there were no comb no rasor furthermore everytime we ran out of shampoo or basically anything in our room we had to ask for more no extra water bottle when we finished our water bottle in the room the breakfast didn t impress us very little choice of food
