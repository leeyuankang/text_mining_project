i would ve liked to order just coffee for room service but was told that i had to order the full breakfast and that if i wanted coffee to go down to the breakfast area and ask nicely if i could get it to go or to drink the coffee from the machine in the room which was terrible the television s movie section was not working no one seemed able to fix it i was told that the engineer wasn t working it wasn t that big a deal but at the end of day it s sometimes nice to get into bed and just watch a movie or wake up in the morning to a nice cup of hot coffee while still in your pj s especially in a star hotel
