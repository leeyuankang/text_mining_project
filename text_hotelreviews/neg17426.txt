there was an odor in our room it was a bit overwhelming front desk offered to move us but didn t want to lose our view of the eiffel tower they even tried to give us something to use to help with smell consistency wasn t there when our room was cleaned daily the bathroom floor wasnt always clean didn t have right amount of towels some nights or missing face towels toilet paper was low and there wasn t an extra one in room assumed housekeepers would replenish but didn t our last night we got a small bottle water next to our bed candy and clean feet towel next to our bed this never happened any of the other nights one other thing to maybe help better overall stay was the temperature in sauna area it was too hot and no air coming in it s okay to be in actually steam room or dry sauna but the lounging area was uncomfortable to sit because of no air circulating
