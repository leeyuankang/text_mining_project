the first room we were given hadn t had any of the bins emptied and there were suspicious hairs in the bath this was resolved quickly as we were immediately moved rooms and the receptionist was very apologetic the room had a coffee machine fridge kettle and microwave but no cutlery plates bowls cups etc brought food back one night and had to go down to reception to ask for all these items the room had two huge tvs one on a stand and one wall mounted seemed pointless really also the remote annoying would operate both tvs so you had to be very careful how you changed channel or you could accidentally switch on the other to wall mounted shower gel body wash but no shampoo conditioner etc supplied which was disappointing small table next to kitchen area in the room was handy but only had one chair not enough for a family of four
