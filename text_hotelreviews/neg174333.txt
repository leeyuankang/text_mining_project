i stayed for a total of nights in the hotel there are soap dispensers in the bathroom one at the bath tub and one at the standing shower area when i reached on my day i noticed that there was very little soap left in the shower dispenser and it was not a full bottle i had thought the housekeeper would notice it and replenish by day but it was not done till the day which was really disappointing meanwhile i simply squeezed soap out into a cup from the dispenser at the bath tub for my use this is an example of a small detail that is important to the customer but overlooked i also disliked the fact that a senior employee at the hotel is unfriendly to guests i assumed he is someone ranked manager as i saw him on more than a few mornings mingling with staff he doesn t make eye contact with guests or greets them
