kitchen utility is worst if one microwave and tiny fidge can be designated as kitchen no bowl no plates not even spoon cooking place is very small this place should enlisted under hotel in booking com not in apartments with kitchen facility if you want stay for couple of days with your family and wish to prepare your food by yourself this is worst choice another thing you have to pay full charge during check in before entering the room so you do not have any choice after only facility location is just near the metro station
