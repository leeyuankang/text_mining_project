i know some people might be put off with noise from metro but it didnt bother us as we re used to city noise the only slight negative about the hotel was level of cleanliness altough clean there were scuff marks on doors and bath i personally like to walk into a hotel room and feel like i m the first person to use it having said that i do believe that the general standard of cleaning has gone down over the last few years in all hotels
