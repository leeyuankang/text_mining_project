the bed frame cracked on our last night so my husband ended up sleeping on the floor there were no other rooms available it was unfortunate the manager apologized and offered a discount when we are next in paris as it turns out we were returning days later the discount was not really a discount cheaper rates on line so we stuck with our other reservation
