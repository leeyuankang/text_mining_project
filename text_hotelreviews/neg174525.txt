although they say this is a prime area and you find yourself in the middle of trendy shops and buildings i would suggest stay in an arr closer to the tourist spots especially if you re short on time i would probably pick opera side next time unless i am doing a longer leisure trip internet was a little inconsistent in the rooms no complains with the hotel though overall
