the hotel just didn t wow us everything about it is fine but it just wasn t special rooms are small which you do expect in a capital city the staff were hit and miss in terms of service some the man who took our bags for example were friendly and welcoming others seemed like they didn t want to be there it was quite inconsistent the water in the sink didn t drain well which was a bit unpleasant when cleaning our teeth we couldn t check in on time which wasn t a big issue but there was no apology it felt like certain things had been really well thought through e g nice looking showers however bad drainage and low pressure just meant the execution wasn t quite there nothing majorly wrong just lots of little things that could be easily improved reasonable for the price
