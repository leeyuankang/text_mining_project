one of the electricians who the hotel hired to fix or just generally maintain the elevator deliberately attempted to run me over with his car several times just a few steps outside the hotel front entrance while walking onto the sidewalk the electrician swerved into me and i was forced to literally jump out of the sidewalk and into the street to avoid being run over by him he then reversed for a second before trying to swerve directly into me causing me to have to jump even further in the road all while he still stares directly into my eyes with a grin on his face he continues to swerve into me for a third time however this time i was more agile and managed to jump back onto the sidewalk so my mother who was forced to stand by and watch her son dodge several murderous attempts on her son and i could surround his car like vultures so we could confront him he then stepped out of my car and my mother asked him why he just tried to run me over he responded with a laugh followed by sorry i don t speak english with no accent whatsoever he then nonchalantly strolled into this hotel to check in with the front desk to work on the elevator he did not except that we were guests at this hotel because when we followed behind him into the hotel the grin he was so proudly wearing seemed to disappear my mother and i then went to the front desk and asked him yet again why he made an attempt on my life he responded by telling us once again he did not speak english both my mother and i were so aghast as to what had just happened we wanted to simply go into our room to collect our thoughts before talking to the hotel staff about what just happened so before going up to our room my mother said to one of the front desk members don t worry we ll let you know how he just tried to run over my son shortly we then continued up to our room
