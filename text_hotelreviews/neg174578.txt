the wifi was truly terrible the pillows were so flat they were useless the bar is also useless because there wasn t anyone there i guess finding the bartender is your exercise amuse bouche just be prepared to find him each step of the way in between drinks if you need anything else if you want the check we were put in room first and had to request a move from a very irritated and put out guy at the reception desk because it was right next to the service elevator and the constant ker thunk noise was unbearable avoid room the second room they put us in had a spider the size of a man s fist in the bathroom sink and a couple of small bugs i found on the bed cover so yay for that we stayed two nights and while we were out the second day after we came back at pm the room wasn t cleaned at all overall the service and facilities are pretty bad for what was supposed to be a good hotel
