the room was really small for my taste the bathroom also very very small the good part was that i had balcony but the furniture is oldish some spidernet on the ceiling the elevator really really tired the carpet was full of dust the sink clogged the bathtub was also old and oldfashioned i wouldn t call it a star hotel but maybe in france the standards are different and the tv selection was very poor not even one music chanel i didn t feel comfortable but the beauty of paris compensates
