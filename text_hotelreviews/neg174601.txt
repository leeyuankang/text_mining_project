in our room we noticed that the smoke alarm detector looked a bit funny but nothing out of the ordainary may have just been because we was in france we didn t let the maid in for the first couple of days and after the one day we did ask for our room to be made up our smoke detector was removed and not replaced just left empty this is concerning for a young couple in a hotel room and on top of this if there was a fire we was have had no smoke fire detector in our room putting us at a much higher risk of damage risk not happy with this please contact the hotel on my behalf and get back to me why this happened
