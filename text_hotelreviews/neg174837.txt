room was quite small no breakfast but you are so central that there are plenty of other places to eat unfortunately there was an issue with another guest during the night a lady was shouting at the top of her voice at the porter at around whilst this kind of behaviour is unacceptable i feel that the night porter could have dealt with the situation better as this issue continued for over one hour we therefore did not get a good night s sleep in an otherwise great stay also when we checked the same porter did not offer any apology for the events i would have expected some sort of discount to be offered but this didn t happen
