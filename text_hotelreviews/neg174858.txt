whilst it was a very nice and well located hotel i did think it was a bit expensive especially as no breakfast was included i guess the location comes at a premium we year old daughter and i stayed in a twin room which was nicely presented and big enough for the two of us albeit the en suite was rather compact even my daughter had to manoeuvre round the door in order to get in whilst internally the hotel was nice and quiet was pleasantly surprised based on how close the rooms appeared to be we were on the first floor to the side of the building which overlooked an alleyway and which was used frequently as a walkway by late night early morning noisy revellers which and i guess not helped by the fact i am a light sleeper my daughter slept ok unfortunately lead to a bit of a sleepless night for me
