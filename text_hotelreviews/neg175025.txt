extremely discourteous rude and unpleasant lady at the reception desk in the morning half a shaven head with very short hair we had misplaced the room key and despite looking for it everywhere couldn t find it when we informed the lady at the reception desk we were first told off and then told to pay to replace it we mentioned that it was an extortionate penalty and she snarled back saying leave the hotel and you are not welcome here ever again we left at the desk and did find the key very soon after check out we went back to return it but were left very shocked at the sudden rude outburst it is such a shame that one bad egg spoils the pack she is a dis service to otherwise a gorgeous treat of a hotel
