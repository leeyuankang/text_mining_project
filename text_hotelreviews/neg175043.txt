unfortunately it all went pear shaped when i needed to pick up my luggage after check out and recover my ipad charging cable and power adapter which i d left behind in the room the behaviour of the staff member who had taken over the front desk was very unhelpful and completely out of step with the rest of the experience she was inflexible bordering on hostile with poorly trained and very patronising communication skills the final irony was that after a lengthy and unpleasant discussion my personal property had already been handed in by the cleaning staff and was lying under the reception counter i e right under her nose i still had to insist she looked for it there before i finally got it back
