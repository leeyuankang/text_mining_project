i arrived very early and of course check in wasn t until much later they offered to hold my bags and i could come back later i had been en route on flights from australia for hours and was quite unwell and faint dizzy when i arrived the staff did the best they could to get me into a room asap but i had about a hour wait and at no point did they offer me any water later i thought i should have asked if i could have paid for breakfast that morning so that i could have at least sat in their restaurant and had some water this technically isn t their fault they were full and were waiting for the first person to check out but i don t think they understood how unwell i was really feeling
