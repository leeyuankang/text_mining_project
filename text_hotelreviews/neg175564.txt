the room was drafty and heating not good so supplemental heating had to be provided in the form of fan heater which had to be turned off later due to noise room was then cold and although tried room heating this was noisy and led to disturbed sleep made comments to staff following morning who were apologetic and would have offered to relocate but it would have been late at night and too inconvenient
