too many things to mention the room that we were given was on the lower ground floor although we had booked a deluxe double room for two nights and pause euros and the excuse given was that rooms on the higher floors were not ready since we arrived early this was nonsense since we were booked for two nights and we arrived early on the second day clearly the room was given to some other customer the reception staff was rude and unhelpful and we felt cheated and mistreated the room was tiny our luggage hardly fitted in and was very noisy with a distinct smell of damp we would never return to this hotel ever again not even pass outside
