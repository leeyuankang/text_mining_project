house keeping cleaned the room but never replaced used items i e tea bags etc also at midnight room service staff knocked the door so strong while we were sleeping when i told the reception the next day they said we ll get back to you but that never happened also in the last day despite my call to reception to help me with luggage to check out i received three calls afterwards in very short times between calls to ask me to leave the room at almost there seems to be lack of communication and alignment between staff finally when someone helped me with the bags i gave him some money he spoke to the taxi driver that i gave him so little in a sarcastic manner that was so inappropriate
