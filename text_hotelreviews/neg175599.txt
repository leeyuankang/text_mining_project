i was taken to a room with very small windows facing a construction site i assume all west rooms are facing that construction since noise was getting to the room even with the windows closed i asked to move to another room staff advised me to keep that room since the noise was only from am to pm i kindly insisted and was given another room facing the opposite street i spent four evenings asking to have the air con fixed for four eveneings the hotel said they could solve the problem right away from the reception only to find out by chance that the air con of my room was broken all along and i had been made a fool the rooms facing east have street noise so you must keep the windows closed horrible experience i felt really disrespected as a customer
