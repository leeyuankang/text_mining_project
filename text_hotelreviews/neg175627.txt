belligerent duty manager who tried to cover up and make excuses for lighting controls in rooms which just didn t work properly the cleanliness of the bathroom hairs in shower splats of something on tiles behind wc the same duty manager who told us lift to basement wasn t working and watched us struggle with baby in pushchair down stairs with two other young children only to be told by waitress there were no issues with lift so we used said lift for return journey an indian themed restaurant where the prices were not cheap but the food was with a chicken korma which didn t look like or taste like anything we had previously eaten in other restaurants and a supposedly madras style lamb which was literally lamb chops not marinated in the sauce but almost cooked separately with sauce then poured over to make the dish awful food but lovely decorated room more to say but running out of will power and not wishing to rant more than already great location though and nice room once cleaned even with dodgey lighting controls and broken safe door with sharp edges
