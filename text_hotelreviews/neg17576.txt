the small size of single rooms n poor ergonomics viz no bedside tables n insufficient space to move even a tiny bit the luggage rack when properly set up stops one accessing the wardrobe the only table in the room is unusually small with tv remote telephone competing for space with the tea n coffee rack i ended up crowding the table further with medicine n other personal trinkets
