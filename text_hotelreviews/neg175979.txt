location stated on the internet is said it was near to wembley stadium miles however it took us hour in a taxi to get there even thought it was actually miles the traffic was horrendous and for the tube you had to go into london then come back out included change so journey was at least mins we wished we had just went for a hotel in the centre of london as we had to leave our cases at kings cross at a cost of per item for hours then couldn t get a taxi tickets to pop into london centre as the que s were too long so ended up walking around the kings cross area so friday was a wasted day
