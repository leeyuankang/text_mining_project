when we arrived our room has been cancelled so the receptionist told us only room available in the hotel due to a lot going on in london that weekend we asked the price it was an extra than we have originally paid we had to pay the difference otherwise we would have been stranded in london for the night when we paid and went to our new room we were shocked and horrified to see the last guests belongings still all over the floor nothing had been cleaned house keeping hadn t even been in the room so i went straight to reception and they told us to use a different room even though they told us the dirty room was the only one in the hotel we got lied to there was no apology for the mix up nothing the guy just gave us the room key and said come down for breakfast in the morning on us no emotion nothing good job they gave us free breakfast we were skint as the additional cost for the room was all we had saved to spend over our weekend in london so even the night we had planned for our anniversary was ruined instead of lovely romantic meal we had to settle for a bottle or water and a cheap take out pizza near by to our hotel so upset and angry at the situation
