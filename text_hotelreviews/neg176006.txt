would encourage staff to practice their english and pronunciation during check in had to ask staff to repeat themselves more than once the price is steep especially given the location and breakfast was extra breakfast not worth the money complete free for all fried eggs undercooked tinned mushrooms mushy sausages half cooked bacon toast takes to goes around the machine breakfast area and dining area too small for the size of the hotel tables and chairs too close together the bathroom in our room don t think there should be a glass partition between the shower and the rest of the room i don t want to see the ankles of the person i m sharing room with as they re dropping the kids off at the pool paid quid for two people night actual cost was including breakfast and parking it s just very steep considering you are not in the heart of london
