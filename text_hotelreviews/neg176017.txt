there was a lot of confusion over the rooms because i had booked two rooms via booking com but only one was paid for when i spoke to a member of staff before getting there over the phone she was not helpful at all when i finally arrived there it took over twenty minutes to check in even though my family and i was the only ones there there were a few issues with the rooms which was finally resolved when i finally got to bed it was clear that the bed sheets had not be changed a member of staff came and changed the bedding
