very loud could hear other residents passing through the corridor at night and in the morning room had a wooden floor which probably contributed to the noise levels and also made the room feel a little colder the walls were in need of some paint both in the room and on the corridor of my floor scuff marks were present in the room both on the skirting boards and on the walls hotel also took a thirty pound deposit which i wasn t aware of i didn t see it mentioned on the booking com website
