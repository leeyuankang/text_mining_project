very disappointed with the signposting to the property we drove around and up down the until we had to stop and call for directions into the entrance even then we were told by the receptionist to drive to the small street which i gather meant a side street even then the signposts were so small it was difficult to enter at the right place the floors in the room were laminate and not carpet which were very noisy whilst in the shower people entered our room they were issued with the same room keys as us room thankfully we were in the room as they entered however we had valuables with us and had we already gone out as was the reason for our stay it could ve been a different storey as there was no safe in the room no towel rail apart from hooks in the shower not impressed at all
