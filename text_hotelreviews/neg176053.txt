our sleep from onwards was constantly disturbed by slamming doors and knocking as well as attempts to enter our room on various occasions by the cleaners when we were already staying more than one day and wanted a lie in we also didn t put a sign on our door stating that we were in need of our rooms being clean so it made for an overall bad nights sleep staff members should be made aware of what rooms not to disturb and not be aloud to just enter a room without knocking also i requested for the invoice to be sent by email over the phone speaking with sebastian he came over quite short and rude and till now i have yet to receive my invoice after being put on hold for minuets this is not professional or expectable at all
