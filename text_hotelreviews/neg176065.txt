our keycard stopped working several times during our stay reception never answered promptly when called from the room tried to use room service and the staff redirected my calling abruptly without letting me know what was happening and then room service itself never answered furthermore why the need to be redirected in the first place when the number gave the impression i would be put straight through to room service the air conditioning in the room was not up to standard it was either too hot or too cold even when we adjusted it an extra bed was provided with the room but no extra blankets or bedding for it overall very unsatisfactory hotel
