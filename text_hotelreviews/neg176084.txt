i went to the restaurant for dinner and was ignored for minutes before i decided to go out for dinner at a local pub the wifi was rubbish and when it says free wi fi on a sign outside it means free for only minutes which for for night is not impressive its not a very easy place to get to and not a very nice part of london but to be fair that s not the fault of the hotel the guy on check in was really abrupt and not at all welcoming shower was ok but could have been a bit more powerful
