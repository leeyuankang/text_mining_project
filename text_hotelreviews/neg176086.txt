whole host of things wrong with this place impossible to find entrance rude and impatient staff i have stayed at a lot of hotels this by the worst will never stay here again what really annoyed me was the fact it says free parking when in fact they charge you a night without mentioning this at all i even asked when checking in yes sir our car park is complimentary to our guests when i was checking out and revising the bill i asked what s this charge for and they said car park even after showing them that they advertise that its free and a member of staff confirmed this the clerk just looked at me and said i don t know why it says that even after talking to the manager expecting this charge to be removed she was even more clueless they did offer me a free nights stay but i declined as mentioned before i will never stay at this hotel or any other holiday inn rip off merchants
