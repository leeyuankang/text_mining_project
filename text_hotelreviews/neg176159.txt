the staff were extremely rude and unhelpful we were originally placed in a room that was already taken and when we returned to reception were spoken to as if we were lying in our new room the wifi didn t work and i was told that it did and i should go to reception to have it sorted when paying for a service i don t expect to run up and down to reception when it is your mistake and finally the new room key card didn t work and i was again told to go to reception and sort it out the hotel itself was nice but the staff need to seriously sort their attitude and politeness out extremely lazy approach to their jobs at the reception desk
