i didn t need the chambermaid knocking on my door twice to clean the room when i hadn t put out the sign for her to come in there was no do not disturb sign there was a street sign telling me to turn left for the car park when it should have sent turn right it referred to another holiday inn with the result i had to drive minutes up the before i could get back to the hotel and then the reception staff started making excuses as to why the sign has to say turn left when it means turn right i told her i didn t care i wasn t complaining so i could listen to her excuses and to the guy who joined in but so that other guests wouldn t have the same problem most people won t bother telling you they just won t come again
