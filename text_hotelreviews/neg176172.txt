the shower room was a little strange in as much as anyone on the floor could see the occupant on the toilet or in the shower the most irritating point is the lack of parking an area was opened to accommodate a vip whilst my husband and i had been waiting for nearly half an hour for a space we were told that we could park across the road but may incur a parking ticket apparently there was a conference taking place at the hotel which tied up many of the spaces it really did cause us a great deal of inconvenience and did make us minutes late for our concert its proximity to transport networks also caused anxiety and having decided to hire a taxi was told that the charge would be something which we had not budgeted for to return to the hotel we incurred further taxi costs on a lighter note we found the room both comfortable and clean it s just a pity that its location didn t fulfil our wishes
