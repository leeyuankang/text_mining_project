the only thing i would mention is that our bed was actually two twin beds pushed together and dressed as if it was a full queen not sure which size large enough for both of us however i really like to cuddle with my partner in bed and the line down the middle made that somewhat uncomfortable however the mattresses were both very comfortable on their own
