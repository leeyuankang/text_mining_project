is by no means a good location but ok we were a family of six and upon arrival were put into far away rooms on the floor where upon our entry the temperature was above c the a c was faulty in both rooms outside it was noisy so opening the window only brought it down a little whilst the room has gotten too noisy in the other room to which we were relocated the shower mixer only had either a hot or a very hot water the receptionist shakiri i think was her name was massively unhappy that i bothered her with a request to update the keys as they were not working she had not been taking care of her nail polish and looked very very poor and unpleasant
