i had move rooms in two separate occasions during my last stay the first time was due to a broken entry door the second due to a broken tv after a long trip with a toddler who needed a nap it was the last thing i needed also i ve been staying here every for night for the past months and the breakfast is of a good standard apart from the bacon is always over cooked and resembles cardboard whilst the sausages are always undercooked and look anaemic apart from these couple of issues i would recommend the hotel and especially the hardworking friendly and helpful staff to any potential visitors
