stayed there more than times already over the span of a few months almost always get upgraded to exec rooms and sometimes i booked exec rooms this last time we again got upgraded upon check in to be given a room designed for disabled access which is very uncomfortable and sometimes awkward for someone who is not disabled i could manage the awkward arrangement of the room and the bathroom but there was a constant green light from the ceiling that cannot be switched off and neither me nor my wife had any sleep that night they offered to send someone to cover it up after midnight but never offered to move us i explained the next morning to the receptionist on check out that we are grateful for the upgrade but clearly that has caused us more inconvenience than comfort
