there was a bit of confusion as to whether our breakfast which we ate after was included in the price of our hotel room we has been charged the breakfast separately although we had double checked with the staff whether we would could order breakfast after and not pay extra money for it the answer was that breakfast after was included in the initial price we clarified it with a receptionist when checking out but it would be useful to make these details clear beforehand just to avoid the confusion when paying the bill at the end
