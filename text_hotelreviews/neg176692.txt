my husband and i were carring only a carry on bag so we didnt see the need of the bellman taking it so the guy didnt like this and just left us at the elevator and didnt take us to the room when we got to the room he had a little trouble with the lights because there were so many light switches and just because of the price of the room i was expecting someone to take us there and kind of explain everything other than that the staff was very nice
