there are many reasons to visit this hotel but i list below a few minor issues that management could perhaps respond to please do not let the comments below dissuade you from booking they re all fixable a the restaurant was quite noisy it would be better to make more of the other two sections for diners who would prefer a more formal setting b the staff were very willing and but they could have had better barista training apart from whomever was on duty in the drawing room at around on saturday he was great c the breakfast was very tasty but the high breakfast was a little cold difficult to avoid as it is spread on a stand however might be wise to rethink the size of the stand perhaps so that it retains heat more effectively if it were my restaurant i would take it off the menu so that the food was not compromised by being cold it did taste good just not very warm d it would be nice to have tea facilities in the room these were delivered and were fantastic quality lovely to have fresh coffee cafetiere but there was a charge
