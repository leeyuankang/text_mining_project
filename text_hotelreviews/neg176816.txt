i checked in at and when entering the room assigned to me i had a major shock it stank like horrible garbage and there was a pair of men s shoes on the floor i got scared and was confused whether or not there is someone in the room and was afraid to enter after looking around for one more second i saw a bag standing on the bed as well so ran out of the room down to the reception which cannot even be called a reception but a desk with some employee when explaining that there is someone in my room and that i was so scared and need to be given another room the employee did not even apologize to me and started calling his manager on the phone after of waiting i was assigned another room and given breakfast for free as a compensation for the trouble at least this room was not occupied and didn t stink however cleanliness was questionable the drain in the shower was full of black hair and clogged the window didn t close properly and was hence super noisy in the room as it was facing the train station the pillows were stained as well overall it was my worst stay ever in paris where i come at least times a year and stay in different hotels in the same price range every time i will definitely never return and can for sure say that this is not a hotel and certainly not worth the a night a total rip off if you have the choice do not stay here there is better hotels for this price i only stayed there because all of the hotels in paris were unfortunately booked out
