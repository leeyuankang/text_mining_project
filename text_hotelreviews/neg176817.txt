you have to go down to get the ironing board and they will tell you to wait as there are no people in the reception after waiting for so long thinking that they will send the iron to your room end up you have to get it yourself from the recep the kettle was not working and when u told them this they replaced with another spoiled kettle whats more this guy of indian descent even argue that he replaced it with new one but he did not check whether its working duh and for storage luggage they wont help you the lady just pointed to us where to store our luggages the door knob in the toilet was spoilt and the bath tub is just for display no water stopper despite the fact that we already feedback with them and they promised that they will do something about it they could lie to the customers just like that and the toilet separate from the shower smells like urine we could not take it so i mop it myself stayed here nights as we have kids and its difficult to transfer hotel anymore but will definitely not coming back and to booking com i honestly having doubts now if the review you posted on your website are authentic
