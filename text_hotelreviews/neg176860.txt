the hotel was under refurbishment but this was not mentioned anywhere at the time of booking as a result there was no steam bath marked clearly in bold as a selling point at time of booking and there was no restaurant there were also no keys available for the hotel rooms this meant every time you left your room and wanted to get back in you had to go to reception and have someone open your room for you i gave the opportunity to the hotel to respond before writing this review and their only comment was had you used the spa you would have been offered discount for the inconvenience and well you were given a free breakfast at per night not good enough
