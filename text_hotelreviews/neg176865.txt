i requested a bath at the time of the booking and did get one and an upgrade as well unfortunately the hot water was not hot at all same for the shower i mentioned it and checked later early afternoon and it seemed to be better but in the evening and the next morning the water was cold again it did spoil things a little bit as it was quite cold but i got over it
