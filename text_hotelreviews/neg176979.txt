room not ready upon arrival at we waited in the bar till we were overcharged on a glass of wine and no one from reception bothered to bring the room key we eventually picked it up ourselves and had to bring our lugage up ourselves there was still rubish in the room from a previous guest not what you expect from a star hotel
