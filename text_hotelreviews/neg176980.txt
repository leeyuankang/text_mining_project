the room was nowhere near a five star accommodation the lights were impossible to work and the electrical sockets worked of the time the bathroom was terribly thought out there was no bath tub and the shower would leak all over the bathroom despite my considerable efforts to contain the spray the tap in the sink was about inches off the bowl so getting your hands under it was difficult furthermore the lights in the bathroom were far too dim and seeing your face in the one properly sized mirror of the room was difficult finally the walls have the sound insulation qualities of cardboard i could loudly hear a phone ringing at everyday from the room next door there was also loud construction and hammering sounds that my wife and i were constantly hearing sleeping a full night especially with jet lag was totally impossible also the blinds in the room were ripped and closing them was very difficult and they were very shoddy looking in the event we were to shower twice in one day we had to reuse our towels because there were not enough in the room there were problems and irritations everywhere we turned it was not a comfortable experience
