having nothing heated in breakfast is weird charging for omelet at breakfast included is weird since it is lousy euro anyhow and having the cleaner coming into the room without knocking the door was very weird and we did not like her shuffling bedding pillows on the top of our shirts nor did we like her reshuffling our stuff in the bathroom counter the way she likes it and they have pillow choices non of which is comfy they are all full and thick which made us lose sleep
