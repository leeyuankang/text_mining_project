our rooms had terrible plumbing piping noises during all hours staff were either dumbfounded by our complaint or just ignored it until we spoke to the manager who was actually aware of the problem and moved us only after nights to a different room as compensation we received free breakfast in bed which was a nice gesture but the breakfast always arrived cold even the hot drinks were cold and also appeared on the extras bill and we had to specifically ask to remove it this should not happen at a star hotel you would expect a much higher level of service for the money you pay mistakes and accidents happen but it was the very poor and incompetent way in which they dealt with the problem that made it clear talk about level of service there were at least two time in which our rooms were not made up and we were told that we had to ask specifically for that to happen what also the rooms are generally not quiet if not noisy due to the adjacent courtyard restaurant club no one bothered to mention that beforehand
