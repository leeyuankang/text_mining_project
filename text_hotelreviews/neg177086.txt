the blow dryer in the room was awful coming from the us it s a simple nice touch to supply a good blow dryer light switches and electrical outlets complicated and in inconvenient areas i would suggest the hotel staff stay in the hotel for a night with luggage etc to feel it out when you have to move around furniture to plug in phone etc those sort of things can be easily fixed did not really like the shower somewhat complex one of those showers that is not enclosed all the way water on the floor common in europe
