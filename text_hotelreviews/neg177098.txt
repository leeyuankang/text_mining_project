although there is a parking place available for guests however there is only two parking spaces for the hotel and only key that you are not allowed to keep also you have to return your room key evertime you go out which makes it very unconveniant to go through when you have lots of stuff a baby to carry and another car waiting behind you to get through so don t plan to rent a car in paris
