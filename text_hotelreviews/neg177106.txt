at check in the reception staff told me the room came with complimentary breakfast but at checkout it was charged on my bill and they said my room didn t come with breakfast they told me i have to pay now and email the hotel and they ll see what they can do cleanliness could be improved some towels have stains and the room carpets aren t always thoroughly vacuumed i didn t like the painting on the wall it seemed twisted or somewhat satanic even scared my little boy laundry is too expensive i booked the junior suite didn t seem like one at all
