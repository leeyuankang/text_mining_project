i used hipmunk to find your hotel and their website stated on two different pages that breakfast was included in the room price however hotel com which actually booked my stay when i clicked through to choose a room had no breakfast included this was unclear and contrary advertising of your hotel the internet connection was unfortunately fairly weak
