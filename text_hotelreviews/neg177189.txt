client service of this hotel is very poor staff not friendly absolutely not client oriented bathtub in room had several damages due presumably to shower appliance strikes on it room was very small as it was for it had a sofa bed we never asked for that so we had real small beds and little space for circulation there are no do not disturb tags available for guests elevators are really slow and quite a lot of waiting needed there is a sign at the elevators where the hotel suggests that you should make reservations directly with them in order to have a better price
