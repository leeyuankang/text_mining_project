the size of the room was abysmally small for example it was impossible to use the hair dryer in the bathroom without keeping the door open my husband suggested that we were given such a small room because we used booking com and the hotel simply gave us a small and cheap room i hope this isn t the case additionally we had to ask for soap and for toilet paper since the chamber maid did not leave sufficient supply of either after the second day our stay was for a week although there was a heating kettle for tea and coffee in the room one day the coffee supply was not adequately replenished and another day no milk or cream was provided breakfast was conveniently available as was a starbuck s on site
