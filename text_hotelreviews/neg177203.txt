the room was very small compact and impersonal we had to ask for the room to be cleaned each day as soon as we mentioned it at the reception someone came to top up teas coffees and clean there is also a card to be left on the door which we hadn t read on the first morning which says clean my room it was in with lots of informative leaflets unfortunately on the reverse is do not clean my room when we went out for the day it was knocked off and put back on incorrectly this could be improved
