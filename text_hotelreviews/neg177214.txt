breakfast was horrible no options in the buffet worst scramble eggs you can ever have fatty very hard sausages fruits are limited to orange and sometimes you can see a banana or two try to catch it before someone else the room was very small even compared to paris standards the water will leak out of the bath every time you take shower there was a pillar at the end of the bed that will block you watching the tv only french channles available with the exception of some news channels wifi was only offered for free for three hours the guy at the reception informed us at check in that the room with the view is only available for two nights booking for four nights and that we have to check with the reception after two nights to change the room when we checked they were surprised and mentioned that the room is available and no need to change
