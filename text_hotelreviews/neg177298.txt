i rang the night before checkout to see if i could have my luggage bought down the next day on checkout and was informed i could but on actually check out day i was informed this was not possible and i was also told there was only one person on reception but there were actually two males who said they would have bought my luggage down if they had know every other hotel i stayed in whilst in france this was never an issue being a mature solo female some assistance would have been appreciated i also requested a small amount of milk to be used in my room but was told it would have to go on my bill through room service i don t believe that was necessary given the small quantity required overall the service levels did vary greatly depending on the staff member all staff should be trained to the same level of customer service
