on the first night the standard room was tiny we had to pay extra to get a room that was just about acceptable for two people we paid for four nights in what i would consider to be a one or two star hotel at best everything is old and tired and in poor repair stained carpets and threadbare little towels instead of bath towels the shower barely worked and the free internet was useless they wanted day for standard speed internet that you can get in mcdonalds there were french tv channels and one in english i don t think that they expect international guests the hotel is just dull dreary and pokey even the ac didn t work properly when you set it to it freezes the room when you turn it off you cant breath after half an hour even though i didn t include breakfast when booking they give you vouchers at check in to trick you into having a very basic breakfast which they then charge for overall i felt ripped off and it spoiled the weekend for us wouldn t go back there again
