there is a apparently disconnection between the reception and the concergerie service i travel around the world for bussiness purposes and in my trips i just say make my request one time i don t know if the disconnection was between booking and the hotel i don t think so because even the requests made directly on the phone were not performed as expected or not with the quality and profesionality that would be expected of the services promoted in the webs and advertisings of the hotel normally i don t complaint and the high price of the services is not an issue for me if i get back a good service for what i m paying for other misinformation was regarding the service offered by the hotel meet and greet it s promoted as a service offered to wait the customers at the airplain door or at least i understood like this actually the person that received us was waiting for us at the baggage claim aerea we wouldn t get lost in this terminal in paris it s not schiphol airport or frankfort but customer expect something special and even the person was very kind and attend the service is not as special as we expected also in our trip back to the airport the driver dropped us at the wrong place and we had to walk a bit to find the right place to drop out luggages we were waiting that the driver would escort us till the check in area for a service that cost and there are taxis and other kind of transport services that for much less they perform better and more professional summarizing big prices for very normal services the room was good i would say better than normal for a luxury room it was not as good as i saw in my trips for rooms with the price this room had again i m use to this kind of prices but it s too expensive i think the customer only pays for the location excellency is something else and i didn t get this in my journey
