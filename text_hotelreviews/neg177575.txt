the one and only and very minor area for improvement would be the buffet breakfast which is quite limited for the price specially when it come to the selection of sliced fruit the room service breakfast i had was outstanding and the restaurant breakfast just didn t match the quality however do not let this stop you from studying at this exceptional hotel
