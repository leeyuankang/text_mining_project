the hotel was not the one i expected the size of the room was too small it lacked a tea coffee machine which is the norm in all star hotels it didnt have a stand where one should put luggage not enough space in the wardrobe and access is limited the fitness center about which there is a long list in booking com description is a space with four pieces of equipment this is a small boutique hotel not the grand hotel of royals as the name suggests and exxagerated marketing works the other way once you are there
