we did have an unpleasant experience when on the second day wanted to try the breakfast buffet a waiter did not allow us to seat in the closest area to the buffet wrongly saying they were booked the reason our skin and race the manager apologized we left the buffet without trying and did not wish to eat there anymore another comment is about the trash canes not having a plastic bag inside specially the one in the bathroom not hygienic for the personal and the things she or he touches in the room this is something a five star hotel should not save money for
