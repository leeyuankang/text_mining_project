the room was quite small but nice the concierge was not informed about vital information important to travelers we were taking a day trip to versailles and inquired where to catch the train we had tickets for a tour so our time was limited when we got to the recommended train station it was closed for construction as was the entire train line we stopped a taxi and asked where to catch a train but he didn t know so we paid him to drive us to versailles so disappointing and when we told the concierge she was surprised but didn t offer to do anything for us
