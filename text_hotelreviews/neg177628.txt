upon checking in it was very cold as the reception area is facing to the outside the outside temperature at that time was almost degree used the turkish bath downstairs and the facility is for both men and women showers also i was feeling uncomfortable to hear men s talking just outside the sauna room since i was alone with only a bath towel wrapped around myself although the change rooms are separated for men and women there is no separate wall between the rooms so when you just step out from the lady s room or a shower booth you may see unknown men just in front of you
