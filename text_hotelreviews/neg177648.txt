our view was of a rundown area with peeling paint hugely disappointing also the room literally had no floor area for a suitcase without it being in the path around the bed we put one bag on the desk area and had to step around the others way to small for a room in a star hotel i have stayed in other star hotels in this area in paris and they offered nicer views and larger rooms
