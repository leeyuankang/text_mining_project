when the waitress asked what we wanted in the way of drinks we asked for tea what we got was a cup of hot water and no explanation of where the tea bags were so i asked and the tea was not good i found the taste of the tea very week and so did my husband he even put more bags in and it was still tastless the waitress was not very friendly also the resceptionist when told of a problem with pillows and a dirty sink behind the bar was not happy to be told th se things so we left on a bit of a sour note
