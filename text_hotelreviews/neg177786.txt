i made hot tea and thwre would be a film in the cup on the top of the water i cleaned the cups out but it would return again which leads me to believe the the hot water brooer had not been cleared in some time also the drinking cups in the bathroom were stained at the bottom in brown so i was hesitant to use them the next day the spon i used for my tea was not replaced with a clean one
