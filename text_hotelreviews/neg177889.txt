the waiter serving the breakfast we were total of people when we got down for breakfast at the bread was almost finished i asked him to get more bread as it would not be enough for the group of us to this he started telling me that there were many people come for the breakfast earlier in the morning and all the bread was finished and as it was sunday he cannot get any more he was raising his hands and my wife heard him saying to the manager these pakistani people are making noise he was the one making all the noise while i only told him that it was not our problem that they were short of an important ingredient of the breakfast once the manager came down more bread magically appeared the manager was very nice and helpful honestly we didn t need any of this in the morning this chap is bringing down a nice hotel and he should be thought how to behave and at least have the decency of not passing racist remarks within the earshot of guests
