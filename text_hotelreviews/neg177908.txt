the first room appeared to be quite small and noisy because of the traffic outside even with widows closed the hotel manager was so nice and offered us much better room for the same price then it was quiet and fine the blanket on the bed was very heavy not what i prefer however the beds are very good not too soft hard the wardrobe in the room was ridiculously small no place to hang all you clothes
