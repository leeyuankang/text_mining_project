although it is a very personal opinion the bed i found to be most uncomfortable with a very hard mattress which made it difficult to rest particularly well i was also disappointed to see no bar area where food could be ordered when traveling a lot for business it is sometimes nice to be able to eat in the hotel without having to find somewhere in an unfamiliar part of the city
