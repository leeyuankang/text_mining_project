the hairdryer was in the bathroom attached to a unit the hairdryer tube broke the first time i used it when i asked for this to be sorted the tube was reinserted and not sorted so it just broke again the phone in the room didn t work there seemed to be a strange stale smoke smell in the bathroom which we reported but this was not dealt with the room was quite small only a shower no bath the shower head could have done with a clean the service to make up the room only arrived when we got back to the hotel at that day and by that time we were already in the room before going out in the evening and given the little space in the room it would ve been too difficult to clean it around us so we just said not to bother
