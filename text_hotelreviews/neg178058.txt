the hotel was a old hotel sort of semi renovated but not to its best my bathroom was leaking sewage water from the upper floor at am in the morning it s a good thing we were checking out that time as the receptionist doesn t seem to have a solution nor even a care or a apology for what happened disappointing end to an average star hotel not four there is minimal amenities in the bathroom rooms are very tiny the internet not fast the location of the hotel is right next to a subway stop but in hindsight i would ve stayed closer to an attraction rather than having to spend alot of time travelling as paris is a large city
