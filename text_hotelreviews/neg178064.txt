the hotel was nice but it isn t a four star standard for example all of the little touches that cement a luxury hotel s status are missing fluffy big towels individual toiletries a big comfy bed none of these were present we paid for a superior room and apart from the size it was disappointing the staff were nice and the shower was good but overall i was let down
