we requested twin room with two separate beds technically we got that but the gap between the beds was speed of wifi was fine when it worked it cut off often and each time you had to sign in again annoying and made working difficult my friend is a bit heavy and for him it was hard to fit on the toilet seat that was squeezed in a very tight spot in the bathroom ventilation was lousy and the tiny room got easily very stuffy judged by this room little palace deserves barely stars
