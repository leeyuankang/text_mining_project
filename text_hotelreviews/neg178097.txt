ours was a very small and smelly room for which we paid euros per night i paid the same price for a far better room elsewhere in a much better area and large clean modern room there are other bigger rooms but the building is old and badly maintained and mostly unclean everywhere the price is definitely very far from the standards of this hotel this is not a four star a two plus at most and the price should reflect that there are far better places at this price in paris there are dodgy people drinking near the entrance of the hotel at night and they even sit on its stairs sometimes the immediate vicinity is not nice the marais is close but not close enough
