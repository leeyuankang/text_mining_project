the bed was uncomfortable the floor coverings were thin so noise from other rooms was an issue for us the staff weren t particularly friendly our request to borrow an umbrella was met with a sigh from the receptionist because she had to get up from her chair the interior was dated in places overall not good value for money we stayed in the nearby hotel fabric a few weeks earlier it was a similar price and our experience there was absolutely fantastic unfortunately the little palace doesn t compare well
