booking com seemed to force me to upgrade to a superior room although i just wanted one with beds we were able to change to a twin ordinary room when we got there but were not able to revert to the lower price because it had already been locked in by using booking com also booking com asked me to confirm my email address and then used that process to say i had confirmed the booking which i was then unable to alter
