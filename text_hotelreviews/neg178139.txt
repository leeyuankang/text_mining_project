somewhat small rooms those offering a super view from the balcony have very cramped bathrooms with shower there are some bigger rooms e g room too with ample bathroom equipped with a bathtub however here some other minor disadvantages are to be faced with the slightly depressing view of a patio and the slanted wall of the attic which makes it rather difficult to approach one side of the double bed one must admit however that staff members are willing to show the free rooms and make a change if needed by the bye double beds are rather narrow and an explicit fatigue of the mattress filling can be stated so one can t even draw a bit apart from his her bed partner unless one would like to run the risk of rolling down from the inadequately supported sagging bedside double beds are equipped with one jumbo duvet as usual in most francophone countries upon request however the friendly staff provided another huge one thanks
