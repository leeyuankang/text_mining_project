we went for a superior room hoping to get a little balcony with park view as advertised here but instead our room was overlooking a light well and the room was always dark which was quite a disappointment we couldn t even tell what the weather was like without sticking head out of the window internet is beyond bad which is shocking for a star hotel there is a login procedure you have to go through each time you need to access internet and it keeps on logging out and refusing to log back in for ages if you just need to check your emails skype this is too much trouble to go through each time imagine you type in all your details and log in write to someone on skype and by the time they had a chance to respond if your phone accidentally locked you are already offline then you need to tell your phone to forget this network and hope you will get a login popup with next attempt to log in i am not the type to use hotel internet every minute or even be in hotel during most of the day but this was just terrible even checking if it will rain during the day required a whole login procedure which often failed so basically prepare to be without any internet access
