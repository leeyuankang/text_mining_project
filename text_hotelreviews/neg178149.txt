the room was quite small the shower over the bath is into an eaves corner so you feel like you need to lean sideways to stand under it anyone taller than me i m not all that tall would presumably have found it even worse there were no tea coffee facilities in our room i d just figured that can be taken for granted these days the hotel was really quite noisy we could hear the lift mechanism in our room a loud irregular clicking one morning we finally decided was next door s shower continuing to drip after they d used it we seemed to hear all the doors opening and closing during the morning especially when the cleaners got started we got there mid afternoon after a very early morning start so we went straight to bed i was almost asleep when i heard someone coming in i called out later please and heard i m just bringing your oh sorry the last bit presumably as she realised we were in bed trying to sleep after that we hung out the do not disturb when we were in or sleeping late but i still had to call to stop one person who was using a card to come in and another time had to answer a knock at the door despite the sign being out it was a cute little hotel but it was much more expensive than say the novotel where we would have got a larger room tea coffee facilities better bathroom quieter i booked this one because i thought it would be romantic but we concluded no we d have been better off somewhere corporate modern and efficient maybe that s just us
