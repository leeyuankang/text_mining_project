as i checked in quite late in the evening i found the night staff to be very rude when i questioned why i needed to pay on arrival lester was very quick to tell me he had the right to totally refuse my booking if i had issues paying in advance as i was on my own and it was late i didn t want to risk having no where to stay on a saturday night in paris
