it was inconvenient that no clothing iron was available it is a star hotel and to me a clothing iron is a basic amenity i can understand not having it in every room but not to make it available on request because some guests forget to turn it off is not a very good reason i booked via booking com and it was not very clear that breakfast was not included in the price the shower was tiny making it difficult to shave in it the shower door leaked the floor was flooded after showering and the floor towel got soaked the walls were thin and we could clearly hear the guests in the adjacent room
