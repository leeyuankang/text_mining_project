the personal touch is missing here two week before our stay i called to the reception desk to ask if they offer some kind of surprise for birthday celebration cause that was our main reason for staying in paris the receptionist said they will bring us a bottle of champagne and sweets as a compliment and as a surprise for the birthday i asked if it s necessary to remind when we check in cause it was meant to be a surprise for the other person and they said that it was already noted guess what nothing of this had happened which for our stay was disappointing
