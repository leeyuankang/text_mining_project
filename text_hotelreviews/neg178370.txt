the staff treat my as nothing when i ask for something i have to wait for two day to get respond all gust when they have problems with the room they change it for them but for me i have hot water in toilet i couldn t use it and i waited for three days just for someone to came to fix it they never change the room for me and the kept me waiting until they fixed the problem i think they didn t like me because the color type of my skin black or for the nationality arabic i was so disappointed because it was the first time for me to be in paris i have been in france other places but paris was the new place for me
