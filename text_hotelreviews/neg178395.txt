i didn t like that they gave me room no and what i ve asked was a high floor room and the balcony has no privacy because it overlook to the next suit terrace which is uncomfortable it s like u r sharing the same balcony and it s not safe coz any one can jump to your room from the next suit if they were chilling in the terrace u can see them while u r on ur bed
