although hotel is extremely expensive the wifi was not free of charge wifi charges itself is also high in hotel it is cheaper to buy a local sim with data bundle than using hotel wifi the breakfast had a very poor selection compared to the price per person for breakfast the rooms were not so spacious again based on the value paid per room the room walls and widows were absolutly not noise isolated i could clearly hear what my neighbor rooms are talking if they just speak a bit louder the price paid for rooms are really very high compared to value of money
