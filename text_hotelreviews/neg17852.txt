the breakfast area was too small with not enough seats and tables to accommodate guests on sunday breakfast was absolute chaos there were no coffee cups the kuerig machines weren t working there were no eggs or sausage or seats or milk or silverware and one poor staff person trying to do it all we wouldn t come back to this hotel because they are not prepared to serve breakfast to their guests
