the check was as bad as it was during my last visit several years ago one of our three rooms was not ready when we arrived which is a very common failing in london hotels when i pay for a room to be available at a particular time arrangements are made on that basis and it s very un professional that they are not ready however but it s the system of checking in that is do hopeless a desk in the offside of the entrance hall with laptops presumably so that people can work at the desk but like last time only of the staff in the foyer actually checking people in as it s not a reception desk where do you wait on a sofa so that if someone then comes through the doors and is nippier than you or smiles winningly at the man at the door he checks her in while you re left sitting on the sofa i note others remark on this adversely so why have the hotel not acted on it
