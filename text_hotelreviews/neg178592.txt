i didn t like the room and bathroom frankly and was quite disappointed when i first walked in very plain and bare considering how expensive the room is also there are odd corners i e the sink in the bathroom is tiny and placing your toiletries is a bit of a pain i didn t like the hotel toiletries and bought my own i also didn t like the way the shower was designed and the water pressure wasn t great the room is actually quite big so there s a lot of space by the cupboard but not by the desk there was no view and that s quite depressing i got used to it and while the location is great it s way too expensive for the room
