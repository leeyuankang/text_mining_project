the room was nice but we found that it was a little noisy during the night with sounds of doors opening and closing etc also had an issue with the shower drain being clogged up we were given some compensation for these issues but if we had paid full rate we d have been disappointed also i think a hotel really should have plugs or usb charging points by the bed to enable a phone to be charged on a bedside table rather than other side of the room
