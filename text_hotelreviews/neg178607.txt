first we got a very small room without window and no armchair or even extra chair not similar to the picture we saw on booking we were very disappointed and did not agree with it alex the guy at the reception tried very hard to find a better room for us finally we were very happy with our nice modern and confortable room aparently there are diffret rooms at this hotel some very good and some not so good
