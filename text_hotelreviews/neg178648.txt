breakfast was very expensive we were asked straight away whether we wanted tea or coffee minutes later nothing nobody came to see if we wanted to order anything eventually i asked where our tea coffee were and nobody knew loads of staff attending to the buffet nobody taking responsibility for customers needless to say i removed the discretionary service charge which for an expensive buffet restaurant is an absolute con i will definitely stay again but definitely wont have breakfast
