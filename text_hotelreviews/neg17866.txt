i was very disappointed with their flexibility to change a reservation date in which i made an error by one day i booked for day of my flight forgetting i would arrive a day later the total number of days would have been the same they would only change if i paid an additional unbelievable and the day manager seemed to think it was funny not at all sorry i would not stay at a mercure hotel again
