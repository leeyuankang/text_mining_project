this is a tired hotel and how it can be referred to as boutique as it s part of the hyatt chain is anyones guess the rooms we re ok but not well looked after with splashes of paint on the walls with the toilet sounding like a steam train as it uses some sort of vacuum method which takes a minimum of two flushes unique experience but not a good one the glass next to the lift was smashed the booking in process is literally in the dark in that the staff have to help as you can t see what your doing due to poor lighting the room whilst adequate in size for a short stay was again tired with paint splashes on walls toilet seat in need of replacement and the phone in the bathroom of poor quality and definitely not giving the place a star feeling what really shocked me was the star rating no way star prices in that the breakfast was an eye watering and shocking this is a possibly due to it s location and restaurants stars but having travelled quite a bit it can t be classed as stars
