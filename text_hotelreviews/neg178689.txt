it appeared i made a reservation including breakfast for only one person while i was staying at the hotel with my girlfriend after the two of us had breakfast the first day they made me sign a receipt for an additional fee pound i proposed to skip this additional fee by simple not having breakfast the two of us the next day this evens right but this seemed not possible even after two email messages with an employee they refused to accept this solution and wanted me to pay the additional fee
