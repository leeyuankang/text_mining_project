very dated rooms and also very basic really need upgrading ac exceptionally noisy and to point of having to turn off during night room then very hot breakfast average most items luke warm and no hot plates to serve on staff over compensate with their helpfulness which actually comes across as false and extremely annoying into the bargain we stay in london on a regular basis and have had some amazing hotels at a much fairer cost with far better facilities i am afraid we will defiantly not be returning to andaz
