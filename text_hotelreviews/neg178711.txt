if your image of a hotel in this price range is a posh neighborhood on a classic quiet street think again the hotel is camouflaged on a busy messy commercial street adjacent to liverpool station the location was extremely convenient for the train station near the old city of london and not too far from the tower of london however for other tourist sites it was a little inconvenient and for that reason i would probably not choose it for a return visit the traffic in central london is horrendous getting to the andaz in east london from central london in a taxi after arriving on the express train to picadilly from heathrow or taking a taxi all the way back to heathrow on our return took a very long time
