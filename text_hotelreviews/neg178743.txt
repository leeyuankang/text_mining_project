noise from the corridor was very apparent from within the room the ac was on a set point with only offset we had it set on the lowest setting however he room was practiaclly unbearable they sent a maintenance man to the room who merely told us it was fine and getting colder i assured him it wasn t as we d been in there for some time yet nothing more was done on the matter we left an item in then room which obviously was no fault of the hotel however we called to ask if they could send it to us and were advised there would be a charge disgusted by the charge we told the hotel we would send someone to collect it we gave the name and time on which the item would be retrieved unbelievably the hotel refused to give the item as they knew nothing about it being collected very disappointed with the overall experience as id booked it as mine and my partners year anniversary
