rather noisy construction across the road during working hours some maintenance in rooms close by however noise from inconsiderate neighbours was i think made worse by the fact that there was an interconnecting door between the two suites my sleep was disturbed on both nights until am or so i enjoyed my stay but it would have been much better without this noise nuisance unsure if i would risk another stay in the same suite shame really it is a lovely hotel
