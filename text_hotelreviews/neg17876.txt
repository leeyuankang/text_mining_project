this was supposed to be a romantic anniversary trip i did inform them beforehand requesting for a high level room and or quiet room and or room with outside view we were given non of the requested upon arrival we were given room on the first floor our view was pipes we could hear people restaurants throwing trash out and speaking loudly i understand that these requests are based on availability but it seemed like it was the worst room available the air con was inconsistent on the first night it was hot and the next night it was cold despite the same temperature setting you could hear the toilet pipework from the building which was really off putting
