room was very hot and i couldn t open the window to get fresh air and even tho i adjusted the thermostat it didn t make any difference there was not mirror near a socket in the bedroom so i couldn t blow dry my hair with ease there was no socket beside the bed to plug in my phone charger i always check my phone before bed and when i wake up and i use my phone as an alarm so this was inconvenient
