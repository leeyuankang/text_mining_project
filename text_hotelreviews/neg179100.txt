a man that was in the entrance of the roof terrace didn t let us get in the terrace saying that it was was fully booked we went inside to find a place but we couldn t find anything so we went back to the terrace as i had seen there were many empty tables there was a nice lady who saw the card of the room and told us we are their guests so we can enter maybe the man should ask if we stay in the hotel or not and let us enter so not ruin our experience receptionists were really nice
