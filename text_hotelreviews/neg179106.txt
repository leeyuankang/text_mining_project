paid extra for the executive room which was advertised as having landmark views at arrival was given a room on the east side of the building facing away from london with no landmark views and the only way to have landmark views was to move out of executive room but we were not refunded the difference saw complaints that the restaurant was open to public and thought this was an unfair complaint however upon trying to go to dinner we were told that no tables were open the rest of the evening and limited times were available the following night staff often seemed to have the attitude of sorry we can t help you
