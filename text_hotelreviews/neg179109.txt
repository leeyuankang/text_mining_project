the only proper issue i can think of was that the lifts took ages but that is understandable as there is floors however there were four lifts also the keys could be a bit of a pain one last minor problem for me was that the tv had limited channels and gave you no tv guide option but that s minor and i only watched the tv before breakfast and before i went to sleep
