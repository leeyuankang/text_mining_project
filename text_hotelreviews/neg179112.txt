parking a to minute walk to get to the parking absolutely not convenient for those traveling by car i made my reservation through booking com upon arrival while checking in i was asked to pay a lot more than what i had booked for that was because the check in person was charging me based on the hotel fares not booking com fares it was then solved after talking to someone else anyway that made my check in take a long time booked the executive room based on reviews of outstanding service and concierge got none of it absolutely nothing different from anyone else i have to say though it might be a good deal if you are in for the free buffet other than that don t waste your money tried the restaurant on the floor on the first night the rooftop was closed for a private event which totally let us down it was to me a good idea to be at a hotel with a rooftop bar so we stayed at the restaurant area it did have nice views but service was somewhat strange on the first night but ok on the second day we went back the next afternoon and it took them a while to serve us as they were having a team meeting in the middle of the restaurant i personally like staying in nice hotels not only for their facilities but specially because of good service based on reviews here i thought that was what i was going to get this novotel has a long way to go
