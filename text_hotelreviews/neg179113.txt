as fantastic as the staff were there wasn t enough of them to make the service i d say at best the service purely due to lack of staff was and all our party said the same on talking to others in the bar it was the only negative not one guest looked happy with wait times on drinks and food but they never actually stopped for a minute in fact one waiter was there at breakfast after we left him at the night before it s a real shame there wasn t more staff around as the ones that were left a fantastic impression on us and would prompt a return visit
