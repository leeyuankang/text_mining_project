on the arrival the check in was a mess and the service atmosphere was monotone and like a dull machine there were no bath towels in the room the breakfast was served on the floor and again the view was amazing but nobody gave me any notice and it was difficult to know whether i shoud just take a seat or wait someone to show me to the table when i was finally shown to the table nobody was interested to take my order for coffee the next morning i ordered breakfast from the room service a few items from my order was missing the service concept is not ready at this hotel and i will not return
