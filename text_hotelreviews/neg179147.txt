the bar staff we were told to move around the bar various times as they were unable to accommodate for paying guests due to reservations despite me phoning up beforehand to ensure we had a table and was told you can just simply walk in and get a table the bar staff was extremely slow and took minutes to make us a cocktail and when asked if he could mix our favourite cocktail he simply refused abruptly and demanded us to choose strictly from the menu or he won t be making a drink
