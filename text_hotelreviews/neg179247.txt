we stayed three nights in this hotel in mid may our room was on the top floor the booking description included free wifi however in the days and nights we stayed there we experienced a total of about minutes wifi access apparently the signal does not reach to the top floor and i was told that it was almost as bad on the floor the office manager did not seem too concerned with the situation although i reminded her on a daily basis we had planned to use smartphone maps in the evenings in order to plan the next days activities not having wifi in the room was for us devastating when we checked out i mentioned the wifi issue again and asked for a reduction in price due to the fact that the hotel s description on booking com clearly did not match reality the office manager refused any kind of compensation for us and seemed not to care my advice avoid this place or at least the and floors if you are expecting century accommodations
