there is no view from the window and one more detail if you will ask to call for a taxi from the hotel be ready to pay extra we came from airport to hotel for fix price and way back we paid driver just said i m putting more cause u didn t catch me on the street which is totally strange but still in the end it s anyway the taxi driver was totally unhelpful so my propose to hotel manager to find better taxi company for future
