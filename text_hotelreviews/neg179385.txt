hotel had no shower gel no soap no shampoo bath tube dirty view from the room was on patio and actually it was a view on huge ashtray cigaretes were all over plus we had room where someone was smoking because we were hungry for paris we did not have time to make all the complains we did not want to waste time and personnel from the hotel was rather not that enthusiastic to help they listen but that was it to conclude hotel is in good location the metro station is close as a star hotel i would expect some more therefore i thing this price should be at least less
