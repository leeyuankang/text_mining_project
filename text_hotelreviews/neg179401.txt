i had a terrible time connecting to the hotel s complimentary wifi no password needed but my ipad kept saying cannot be verified we had stayed at this hotel two years ago with no wifi problems so i assumed my ipad still had in its memory the hotel s wifi but that the french police were monitoring all wifi s now and since my connection was two years old and before the large terrorist activities i had to somehow verify myself and my ipad with the authorities and i had no idea how to do that in the end it had more to do with the hotel wanting my cookies and i had to re register everyday to get a wifi connection and agree to whatever this hotel s pop up screen wanted
