it was freezing cold temp in my room was which i could see on the aircon panel it was impossible to heat up the room after hours of sitting in sweaters in bed with aircon set up to max heating it was degrees this is unacceptable i complained and was promised a heater but noone brought it to my room my colleagues had another room and it was the same i also got mail that i can t get breakfast and can pay for cereal and order it to my room what a pleasure to sit in this freezing room and eat cold breakfast i definitely do not recommend to anyone
