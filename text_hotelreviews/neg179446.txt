the room was very quiet once you turned off the air conditioning with good doubleglazing even though it looked over the place catalogne except for the minibar which could not be turned off it appeared to be linked directly to some central system for recording what had been taken out of the fridge however the helpful staff at reception organised for it to be turned off even though this was not a normal request full marks to them once it was turned off the room was very quiet hotels seem to think that quiet room means no external noise but appear to ignore internal noises such as air con and minibars the noise from which can be just as intrusive
