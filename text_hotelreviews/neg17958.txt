all i wanted after a very long flight from australia was a cup of tea room service was prompt however quite expensive although it maybe common to have a kettle in the room it had all the other comforts you would find so being able to make a cup of tea would have been perfect it was however served in a beautiful pot so i guess that made up for it on two occasions we other guests were asked to leave the drawing room so that a guest could interview someone seemed rather inconvenient overall good
