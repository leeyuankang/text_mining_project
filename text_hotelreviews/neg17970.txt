i had an incident where an employee barged into my room when i had a do not disturb sign on at a m this made me jump out of my bed scared for dear life i obviously called the front desk asking for an explanation and they simply replied that they have been told of the incident by the employee who mixed up the rooms and they have informed the manager a couple of days pass and i hear nothing from them i called the manager and asked if she knew what happened she confirmed and simply said that the employee needed to be reminded of what a do not disturb sign meant i mean i would appreciate it more if they have done more than just saying that i don t know send a free fruit basket whatever it is it is hard for me to fall asleep in general and then someone barges in without even knocking it really frightened me and of course couldn t go back to sleep
