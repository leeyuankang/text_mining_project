one guy at front desk was not helpful we were told that we booked twin room and not a double room and the option is to upgrade by paying extra minutes later the other person at reception said a double room is available as well as the upgrade option transparency regarding the rates for upgrade was missing upgraded room only has a better view and not much else the furniture etc in upgraded room is same and fittings were improper minibar bottle container once opened cannot be closed and you have to buy drinks if you accidently push open the lid i think they give upgrade options to every guest just to make extra bucks disappointed
