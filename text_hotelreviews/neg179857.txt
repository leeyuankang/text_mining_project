the room had a smell as if previous occupants smoked the smell didn t go away for the days we stay i didn t complain about it so i don t know how they would have dealt with it also by mistake i left my own white towel in the bathroom and was mistekenly taken away by housekeeping not a big issue told reception but wasn t too worried to follow up
