unfortunately a lot of things but most importantly there are security issues with the hotel during my first night a housekeeper just barged into the room unannounced and unapologetic about it while i was sleeping given that this is not a standard practice of any hotel esp that they should always knock before they enter things got worse the last day of my check out they checked in a guest into one of my rooms i booked two at am before i check out i even entered the room thinking it was still mine with my key and found the new guest already sleeping on the bed and shocked when they saw me come into the room that was completely absurd and never heard of especially in a supposedly star hotel when i checked into this hotel twice i was given the rooms after so to actually check in a guest into an unchecked room before was a rip off to me to make things even worse after at least minutes of arguing with the manager about it they were not taking responsibility he did not apologize for this until i demanded an apology i have never ever seen such unprofessional behavior of staff ever in any of my travels around the world and in any hotels i have been to i would never ever recommend this hotel to anyone other things worth mentioning rooms are the smallest i have seen out of all the hotels i have been in london breakfast was very limited and dull sometimes it was a little challenging getting a taxi to the hotel
