this place was a disappointment the space is tiny and the floor was very dirty they need to deep clean the floors when my family arrived the toilet was broken throughout our stay they had people coming to fix it but it never worked even with the toilet not working they did not discount me anything the staff there told me that i will receive a receipt at the same day through my email but i have never received any receipt when i came home i checked my credit card and it turns out they charged me extra transactions a few days after i have already arrived home when i contacted them regarding the receipt and the extra transactions they took more than a day to reply and told me that they discounted me for the toilet by charging me less city tax and there was no mention of extra charges this didn t make sense because they charged me for the hotel and city tax separately the city tax was paid in full so overall it ended up costing me more than what i originally booked on here i tried to contact them again because i do not understand why they are charging me even after my stay when i did not touch any of there stuff and its not even small charges they were about euros for each charge are you kidding me they still haven t reply about it so i had to call my bank to deal with this matter i am very unhappy with this place and would not reccommend anyone to stay here this is definitely not a star hotel please take my advice and save yourself the trouble
