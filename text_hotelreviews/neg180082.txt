advertised as bathrooms so i picked it because we were six girls and i couldn t afford the bathroom apts our apt was actually shower room and separate toilet room we were very disappointed also the bedrm was located up these narrow steps in the apt and luggage couldn t safely be transported up there finally the living room wasn t even big enough to hold ppl at one time super uncomfortable
