confirmed prior to booking about late check in charges and were reassured that there will be none upon arrival before and waiting for a member of staff a gentleman arrived and suggested that we need to pay euros after a bit of discussion the suggestion by him was that we pay euros and leave a good review on the trip adviser website at check out no charges were applied but my experience did not have a good start and their suggestion to ask for a good review in exchange for a charge was not ethical nor friendly
