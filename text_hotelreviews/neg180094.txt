if you re looking for the polish of a hotel type accommodation this is not it it s more like an slightly bohemian airbnb ours had a very nice charcoal drawing that was done on strips of tape on the living room wall two minor things the dark cloth flooring tended to catch lint so the place never looked fully vacuumed and the window was left open after the cleaning presumably to air out the rooms so though the unit is in a locked courtyard it didn t seem very secure
