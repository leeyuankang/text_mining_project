the suite itself think very small parisian bedroom studio retrofitted into a hotel room you get a tiny bedroom with double bed and bathroom with standup shower the water only heated up to lukewarm at most the living room has a pull out sofabed the tv and the kitchenette nespresso capsules are provided at eur capsule although the breakfast is a great deal and the croissants etc are freshly bought for hot drinks you have to use the hot water boiler provided in the room as well as instant coffee instant hot chocolate or tea bags provided for free or the eur capsule nespresso to sum up the bad is only details which are fine when you get a good discounted price given the great location however at full price given the tight space for i would defintely go with the big buisness hotels all over paris periphery
