the room was cramped for even though we had children the food preparation area was almost inadequate i did even try to prepare a meal we were on the bottom floor next to the courtyard and heard every movement and noise from other residents with kids running around outside till the room had no fan so we had to keep the window open all night the only channel in english was bbc news although the boys enjoyed watching scooby doo in french
