my only small complaint is a very tiny one checking in there is no restroom nearby easily accessable my young son had to use the facilities pretty badly after being on the train then the metro then the walk to the hotel and there was nowhere close for him to go the man checking us in told me it wouldn t take long and he could go in the room but for a little boy even the fairly simple check in process was a while to wait and i wish he the staff member would have had a better option for us maybe he could have taken us to the room and let us fill out the paperwork there just a suggestion and honestly this was a small issue and the only one we had during our stay
