the size of the rooms made it very uncomfortable to stay the double room with adults in it was unpleasant once all the beds were out there was no room for our bags and no room to walk around the beds in the bedroom to get to the bathroom you had to walk over the bed and the foldout in the kitchen took up the entire kitchen space paris was great and i would definitely stay in montparnesse again but not at this hotel
