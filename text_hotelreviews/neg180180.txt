no staff apart from the bar all computer check in nothing personal about this hotel complete buget with a star price tag yet when you add on the cost of a mere cup of tea it soon adds upto star prices people hanging around some asleep it was more like a student hostel as for the bedroom i do not appreciate brushing my teeth in the hallway i own bigger shoe boxes squashed and claustrophobic is how myself and my husband felt couldn t wait to leave glad this trip was business not pleasure
