i understand the savings made from using self service check in hubs and the support staff hovering around are great but when you re tired from a journey and just want to get to your room and the bar having to laboriously type in postcodes and telephone numbers on a clunky screen keyboard is a pain not severe but mildly irritating the hotel is only one year old and there are little signs that maintenance may not be quite as obsessive as it should be electric blinds a little damaged wash basin tap a bit wobbly these details that didn t bother me but if maintenance isn t kept at it will soon get dingy and the whole brilliant cool value proposition goes down the drain and it turns into a bland mercure or best western
