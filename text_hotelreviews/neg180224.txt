cleanliness was not good our bins were not emptied even though our room had been serviced the toilet stank i had to leave a note asking for it to be disinfected so the stench of old urine could be removed after the toilet was disinfected the bathroom was left with white streaks of the disinfectant all over we had to wipe these off ourselves also the breakfast is a rip off as if the pounds p p charged for breakfast is not high enough the hotel charges an extra pounds if you decide to book the breakfast on the day better go to of the many places nearby for a good breakfast for better value
