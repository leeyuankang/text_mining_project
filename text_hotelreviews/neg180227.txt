the pillows were super fluffy the first day i arrived but as i used them they got flatter and i was only there for days having an ipad to control the room was fun controlling the light color and easy however the ipad had to be on the dock the whole time or else it runs out of charge the hotel s lifts work using your room key for security measures however sometimes i had to scan the card multiple times to get the elevator to work i had an incident where i was sharing the lift with guests staying on the floor and i had to wait for the lift to reach their floor before going back down again to my floor the hotel doesn t provide any amenities the room is only equipped with a safe mini fridge hangers and lacked bathrobes slippers and toilettries
