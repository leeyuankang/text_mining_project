even though we had looked at the room pictures on booking com it was a shock to see the size of the room and that we couldn t walk around the bed but had to launch ourselves onto it from the end of the bed the bed itself was quite comfortable it was a real squeeze to fit in our large suitcases as they wouldn t fit in the drawer under the bed we liked the public spaces downstairs and the rooftop bar with its fantastic views but for a day stay would have preferred to have had the space to be able to relax in our room
