rooms are too small decent price i guess for london and such a great location but man that room is small guess i m just a big american from the great big ole usa and used to wide open spaces this place doesn t have that if you re looking for convenience of location though it s hard to beat if you re traveling with kids i d probably avoid this place since it is so cramped
