we were a group of friends travelling together some of us sharing rooms we did not like the bathroom that was enclosed in frosted glass sometimes you need a bit more privacy frosted glass bathroom doors is an awful trend that needs to go there is no light dedicated to just the bathroom so if you need to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night you will have to turn on the mirror light which is part of the common area there is a curtain that acts as a partition but its transparent so not functional
