awful experience from start to finish despite being very expensive for what was offered the staff were unable to help when it became clear my original booking was messed up i had to have someone else sort it out online rooms are very small completely soleless and clincal a good portrayal of the death room from the movie soylent green the room access card needed for virtually everything stopped working and i became stuck in a lift for minutes resulting in my being late for an important event no apology received just uniniterested hosts i think they re called alarms went off at in the morning due to someone having a shower and the place had to be evacuated a complete lack of information or staff on hand to aid those who needed it didn t help there was no guidance nothing on re admittance the vagrants were allowed in as well and spent minutes harrassing tired and already irritated guests for money there was no one to remove them perhaps due to the almost complete absence of staff the format for this hotel is a victory of marketing and glitz over substance don t be fooled by the colourful busy exterior or friendly welcoming website page it s anything but that regrettably the rating indicator doesn t offer anything more damning that a frowning face otherwise i would have clicked that i really was disgusted with the whole experience apparently we are advised the sister hotel in paris has been completely remodelled following similar client experiences caveat emptor
