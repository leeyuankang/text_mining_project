about half of the rooms including mine do not have an outdoor window but but face an inside court with no real day light and facing the opposite rooms at such a short distance that you have to keep the blinds closed if you want a minimum of privacy given that the rooms are really tiny it is very claustrophobic the nice entrance hall and bar as well as the ipad controls and other funny but no needed features sadly do not make up for the room size it reminded me of my time as a child when we had a caravan if two people use the bed the one next to the window has to climb over the other person in order to go to the bathroom the storage space under the bed is fun but a bit useless as it s too shallow to put even a small suitcase it so that one stands around in the already too small room the check in system asked me where i wanted my room to be located in the house i asked a friendly staff member to advice me she told me to chose high up facing a back road as that would be the best of the three propositions i ended up with a room on a low floor with no real daylight the whole thing was a bad joke
