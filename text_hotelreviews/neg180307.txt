i don t think this hotel is a good option for long distance travellers with lots of luggage the rooms are too small and one ends up falling over your suitcases to get to the bed although the breakfast is great it is a bit chaotic to find what you want and a great challenge to find a place to sit and eat it it was a pity that the best space on the patio outside were occupied by smokers
