very few complaints for this hotel the rooms were small but clean the room setup at least for ours was better suited for partners who don t mind being in a very intimate space the bathroom walls are semi transparent and the bed is arranged against a wall so that one person basically has to climb over the other to get in and out of bed also the breakfast is not a good deal it would be great if items for breakfast and dinner were offered a la carte
