the rooms are in my opinion quite small the bed is big and the bathroom is very big but it does not leave a lot of free space to leave your luggage even though i ll give them credit for placing a drawer beneath the bed for storage the cleaning it felt lik the cleaning crew had very specific orders what to do and that is all they done few exampls they put new water in the fridge but didn t take the empty bottles we ate pizza one night and the pizza box wasn t taken out of the room one night i left my towel hanging on a hanger and it was left there even though they put a new one in the bathroom
