the bed was a little firm for me and as its placed sideways across the room from wall to wall whoever is laying closest to the window has to climb over the other person there didn t seem to be separate lights for the bathroom so if you need to get up in the night you have to put the small lamp on which again wakes the other person the main problem for me though was that the ventilation blows directly on to the bed and you can t can t turn it off i personally can t stand being in a draught so it meant i was cold for most of my stay or had to burrow under the covers the room wasn t cold i turned the temperature up and it responded very quickly it was just the ventilation
