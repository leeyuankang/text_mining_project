there was a fridge in the room but apparently they had taken out the kettles due to a problem with them setting off the fire alarms tea and coffee were available a day downstairs but you have to pay for them i very much object to paying over pounds for a cup of tea as the room is so small there is no room for your suitcase that is no problem if you are there for a few days as i was and can put your clothes away in the storage area if you were staying overnight there is not enough room to have your case on the floor and live out of it
