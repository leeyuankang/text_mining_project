did not get a quiet room i requested initially moved to a high floor but bar looked right into the room so had to have the blind and curtain closed all the time the moving light in the courtyard made a noise right outside my room asked to be moved again ended up in a high floor looking out as i had requested at the point of booking would have been great to get that last room first
