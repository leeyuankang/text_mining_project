the ipad to control lights and media is great and handy but even when switched off it keeps lighting up in the middle of the night lighting up the entire room and waking us up we ended up by covering it with a scarf each night but there should be another solution especially given that summer visitors probably won t have a scarf also we were on the first floor and there was a slight but noticeable rumble from the underground until midnight and very early in the morning so people who are sensitive to noise and spend a lot of time in their room should probably ask for a room higher up in the building
