there was no kettle for making tea or boiling water this is a very basic necessity in any hotel whatsoever everytime i had to go down to the bar to fetch some hot water which was inconvenient and also risky to carry boiling water in lift and then take it to room for making tea the hotel provides a bar and expects us to purchase something as basic as tea for pounds not done
