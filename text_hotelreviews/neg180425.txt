bit naff staff in the cafe really noisy so i had to move somewhere else to hear myself think only disposable cups and plates in the front cafe ipad in the room didn t work very well flat and failed to charge overnight also really bright if checked it in the middle of the night coloured light in rooms unpleasant and almost nausea inducing in the shower check out computers were broken but staff came to rescue quickly check in card is bag tag also advertising gimmick but doesn t have room number on it so you have to carry the little piece of paper around too which is easily lost due to lack of windows that could be opened in room ventilation fans very loud though this is common to lots of newer hotels i would be interested to see how its carbon footprint compared to other hotels with fewer buttons
