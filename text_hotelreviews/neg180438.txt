i mean i don t enjoy having to spend so much on a hotel room quid for a double room for two nights but it was seriously reasonable for central london especially on a weekend besides if i had booked a cheaper place outside of the city centre i would have probably spent just as much money on public transport and wasted time coming in and out of town so i m not complaining
