i m not a fan of hard floors in bedrooms although i do appreciate it make it easier to clean can we have some slippers to make it softer when walking around also an iron in the room just makes life easier in fairness i may have been able to order this from an ambassador but didn t check the room was fine for me as a lone traveller but i m sure it s a bit snug for people and going to the loo in the night must be a pain for whoever is at the window side small issues really i did have a great stay
