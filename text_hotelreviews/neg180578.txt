i extended my stay which proved to be a bit of a challenge room card wasn t working and had to go down to reception times to fix finally when it worked there was no electricity so had to go down to reception again too much technology quite frustrating when trying to get some rest on the last day i called to request a late check out as i needed some sleep they confirmed and i agreed on a price i was then abruptly woken up telling me that i have overstayed and needed to check out i explained again that i had let them know staff definitely need to communicate more very unprofessional
