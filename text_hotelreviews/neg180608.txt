having booked rooms i would have liked the ability to check all three in one go and pay for them in one go it felt a bit silly to go round the self check in booths three times and do three transactions this was technology for tech s sake rather than to make life easier lift was a bit temperamental with the cards i could not work out how to light the bathroom only in the night it would have been nice to have had an actual light switch to control just the bathroom as opposed to lighting the whole room or coming to grips with the tablet settings i also wanted to switch off the tablet in the night but could not so i put it face down with the result that it was out of charge in the morning would have welcome more toiletries in the room such as hair conditioner the shower gel was good but it could have felt a bit more luxurious i guess more in keeping with the vibe in the rest of the hotel don t get me wrong we did enjoy our stay these are niggles rather than big things it s just that on the whole i felt that the technology focus was trying too hard and that the rooms could feel a bit less functional
