room was very small akin to an easyhotel room but trying to appear not so basic bed squashed end to end across the room wasn t great and the duvet was far too warm i normally want a warm duvet but this was ridiculous i d take the duvet off to cool down and in less than minutes be too cold and the cycle would repeat so i didn t get much sleep very very disappointing as with all the hipstery bells and whistles that make this a funky hotel there s no point to any of that if you can t provide the basic requirement of a good nights sleep
