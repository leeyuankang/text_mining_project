the beds in all rooms are enclosed on three sides so the person furthest from the room has to climb over the other to get in and out the wash basin is in the room and the loo and shower behind a glass enclosure so if privacy is an issue you might think twice about booking this hotel i enjoyed my stay but would not book again unless the price was low enough that it tempted me from booking another hotel with more room space and greater toiletry privacy
