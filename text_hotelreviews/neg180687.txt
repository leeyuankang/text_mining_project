the double bed is fitted into the room on three sides so if you get up at night you have to crawl over your partner it is also quite high up so some people may find it difficult to use depending on disability there is also no headboard so sitting up in bed to read or watch tv which is above the bed so not easy to watch from anywhere else is not as comfortable as it could be another pillow would have helped tiny space for working but then there is plenty of space downstairs
