i do like a cup of tea and there was no facility in the room to make one also if you want a room with a good view make sure you check in as close to the check in time as possible otherwise they go like hot cakes i did put a request in for a room with a view as it was my fiancee s first visit to london and having a cool view from our room would have been lovely but they can t offer that we arrived early but couldn t check in already so by the time we got back from a day of sightseeing we didn t get a look in on any rooms with a view
