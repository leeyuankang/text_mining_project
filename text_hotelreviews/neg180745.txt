no one checked if you had paid for breakfast which meant we paid a lot of money for breakfast and others just helped themselves to it for free we also didn t really understand if hot drinks were included in the price and couldn t find anywhere that told us but that is a very minor thing compared to all of the amazing things one problem we did have was that with the ipad it doesn t show the battery percentage and also the adult section in the media part is very close to the volume button when you have the remote open this was made incredibly awkward when the ipad suddenly ran out of battery and i had accidentally put on an adult film and couldn t turn it off until the ipad had charge enough
