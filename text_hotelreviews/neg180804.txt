to be honest i don t really get the concept of the hotel room size is really small though everything tries to fit into a nice and cozy way it just cannot make me comfortable and you pay around per night maybe it is some culture or conceptual things involved i feel that this may only fit into new generations though am also from late won t come back not recommended if you are looking for comfortable hotels with reasonable service level ah and no hot water no slippers either basically no services provided
