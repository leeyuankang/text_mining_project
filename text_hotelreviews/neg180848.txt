however it took ages for checking in and out due to the fault at the reception clearly the computer system did not set out well enough to support the service but to slow it down and made it very complicated some of the stuff at the bar are not very helpful i asked for a latte to go and it took her more than minutes to figure out how to make one because she is all playing around with other stuff and the coffee was only filled by of the cup bit disappointing
