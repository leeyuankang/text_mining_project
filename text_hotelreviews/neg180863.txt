there are certainly lots of gimmicks and razzamattaz about this place and the stay is a slightly different experience than usual but having no tea coffee facilities in the room misses the mark completely there are certainly no spectacular views of the thames or tower bridge as it said in the description of the hotel my room had a great view of the shard and there are good views of the tower of london from the upstairs bar but i wanted the thames because it advertised it no coffee first thing in the morning you can keep your fancy ipad air conditioning and streaming tv which didn t work
