security here is very lax we were twice bothered by a guy approaching people and asking for money downstairs none of the staff seemed to notice him even when he appeared to be trying to nick stuff from someone s backpack at the bar anyone can get up into the hotel rooms via the lifts or stairs as there is no id or security in addition the food downstairs is incredibly overpriced for a self serve english breakfast and the ipad controls of the room while very amusing didn t actually work properly e g the air conditioning did not respond at all the rooms are basically pods and i would not really recommend for a long stay or for older people who might have trouble clambering over one another to get into the beds which are accessible from one side only
