there was a power outage not the fault of the hotel but as a result even the water did not work it highlighted the over dependance on technology as it was not possible to open the blinds or a window and there was no air conditioning a back up power generator might be worth the investment if the power cut had not occurred the review would have been even more positive but not being able to wash is a big negative even if the hotel cannot be responsible
