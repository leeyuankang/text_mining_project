the view was fantastic but we couldn t work out how to open the blinds to make the most of it i don t think they do stay open as there is a permanent privacy blind then a blackout one you can raise and lower the toilet is contained in a frosted glass case in the room so whilst with my sister i didn t care with a new love interest that may have felt a little awkward on the whole though fantastic stay great staff great location would return
