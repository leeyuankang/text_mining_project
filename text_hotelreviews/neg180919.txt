mealtimes were confusing there was no menu so you didnt know if there would be food we would like therefore couldnt plan ahead meals were written on a board with no price or explanation of what was included there was hot meals and an area with cold food i had to keep asking how much things were and what was included in price so tended to eat elsewhere
