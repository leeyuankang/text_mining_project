although the public areas in this hotel are well equipped one cannot really find a quiet place to work outside the room the room itself is too small for a desk wouldn t recommend this hotel for someone who plans to work from the hotel during his stay unless a noisy cafe lounge like environment is sufficient staff mostly smiles but not really helpful when needed take a room with outside facing windows the inner facing rooms miss all the action
