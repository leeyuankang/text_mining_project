generally all was fine but some minor quibbles only breakfast choice was okay but hot food was generally cold and the plates were cold too sometimes it s nice to be able to make yourself a tea coffee in your room whilst getting ready although i understand the logistical space implications room was fine for short stays but storage could be a problem for longer visits ie two larger suitcases and limited hanging space
