there was a mix up with my booking my fault i booked in for one week after the actual date i was arriving thankfully there were rooms in the hotel but i was charged just short of extra for this as it was a genuine mistake i would not turn up to london without a booking i thought they could have charged me the same but instead they charged me extra i had no choice but to agree also the canary warf rooms are looking onto a building site this needs to be changed temporarily whilst work is going on i changed my room
