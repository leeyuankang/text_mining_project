we stayed in a loft room which was very nice but also relatively expensive so it s surprising that the in room extras were so distinctly lacking the shampoo conditioner and shower gel were tiny and by not being an established brand it makes them in any case feel cheap there was also no toothpaste or toothbrushes perhaps even more disappointing though was that we had to order tea from room service surely a base expectation in any hotel is that you can make a cup of tea added to which the coffee machine only had two capsules and no fresh milk also quite why you would make people pay for films just offer the sky movies like most other decent hotels as a comparison the dean street townhouse is similarly priced but they provide full sized bottles of the full range of their cowshed products in the room this is an established brand and a very nice touch they also provide toothbrushes and toothpaste etc recognising that you may not want to bring this with you for short stays there is also ample coffee pods tea options and fresh milk generally it feels like a far more personal experience if honest for the best part of i spent on a one night stay for the the room drinks and dinner at the london edition i feel more could be done to make the experience about the customer rather than the profit margin
