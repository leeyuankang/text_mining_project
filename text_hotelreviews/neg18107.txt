this is being a little picky but i would have liked a dressing table with a mirror with lights to put my makeup on instead of standing in the bathroom where the lit mirror was perfect as there was no place to rest your make up apart from the wet sink an the full length mirror was in the living area an the lighting of the room was quite dim with no option of having stronger lights on
