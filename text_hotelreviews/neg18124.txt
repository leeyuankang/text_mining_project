overpriced and only deserving of a star rating the superior room we got was tiny horribly hot with a view over the service yard the room didn t have basic facilities like an iron and coffee or tea facilities which in a star was a bit poor the decor was so sparse and cheaply finished in the bedrooms felt more ikea than premium you also need to reserve in advance a table in the punch bar even if you are a hotel guest which would have been helpful to know before arriving or even when checking in but we only found this out when we went to go for a drink and were rudely turned away overall an underwhelming star hotel
