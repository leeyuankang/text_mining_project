we were awoken by someone opening the door to our room at in the morning as i was then awake i went to reception at to enquire what was going on to be told that the night porter had assumed our room was unoccupied and allocated a key card to a couple checking in at in the morning we received no apology nor appreciation of our concern for this breach in security from neither the night porter nor the duty manager when we once again reported this incident the following morning the safe in our room was also not functioning we would suggest to future guests to take care with security when using this hotel in future
