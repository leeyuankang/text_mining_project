the hotel boasts of having ipod docking station with music being able to be played in the shower this is a complete lie as the rooms doesn t include this rather has a device which is called ihandy this is like a mobile phone which allows for free calls when i raised this issue to the receptionist they suggested that i use the tv and put a higher volume so i could hear it from the shower had a top floor room which was very humid the bathroom had a weird smell to it overpriced for the room size as well as the facilities
