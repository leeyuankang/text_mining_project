it is an extremely overpriced facility the room was so small that people at the same time could not stand in the room the space was so limited that we couldn t open the suitcase properly but this was not the worst part the room was not properly cleaned dust everywhere the sheets and duvet were obviously not thorough cleaned plus extra bonus the smell of mould as you entered the room extremely poor facility and sooooo overpriced i wouldn t recommend it to anyone
