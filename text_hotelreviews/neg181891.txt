the rooms are extra small so everything inside the room is also extra small the bed is not terribly comfortable and the sink in the bathroom is so small that it is impossible to wash your face without properly flooding the floor you can literally jump into the bathroom from your toilet seat in one ordinary step the desk is also small and coordinating your actions requires surgical accuracy if you don t want all of your your stuff to fall on the floor then again the price is lower than the hotels and other b bs on chiswick high road so no free lunch i suppose
