was really tired after travelling all night just needed a few hours sleep before attending a meeting in piccadilly it wasn t to be firstly as we just dozed off we were rudely awakened by a staff member charging into the room and then backing out saying sorry we attempted to go back to sleep but a short while later the fire alarm went off we buried our heads in our pillows and it ceased obviously being tested we attempted sleep yet again but guess what the fire alarm went off again we waited it ceased sleep deprivation is kicking in now its like some form of torture we assumed it was another test after no movement so attempted sleep again just starting to drift into sleep and yes you ve guessed it the fire alarm went off again i went out into the corridor to be informed by a staff member that people are smoking in the rooms at this point we gave up on the place and went into town to get a bit of peace somewhere the point of booking for two nights was to get a few hours sleep when we arrived at approx was a waste of time and money wouldn t do it again we came back later that night grabbed a few hours sleep and legged it
