i had ordered a room to the backyard because i need a silent room for sleeping the room i got was also so compact that i couldn t stand up without knocking the head in the ceiling and the window was also in the ceilinng the room was absolutely not worth the money for that price i think they could have a room service for simple breakfast delivered from the new coffee shop at the corner
