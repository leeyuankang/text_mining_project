rooms were extremely tiny definitely too small for two people sharing and for more than a single night stay rooms were not cleaned well thick layer of dust remained everywhere for all days of our stay and there were stains on the bed covers as well as the curtains cleaners actually used some of our body lotion which was kept away inside the cupboard while we were out for the day
