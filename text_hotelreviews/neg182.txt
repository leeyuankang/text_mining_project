finding no car park when i had chosen a hotel with a car park was very annoying there was no real place to drop off our bags so we walked from the hospital car park some way the staff were a bit abrupt not really listening i asked for another pillow in the morning and when none arrived by evening i called reception they said one coming very soon i had to ring again and was told his colleague had been told some time later i had said i wanted to go to bed the pillow arrived with the explanation he was busy and had forgotten i took the opportunity to ask if we could cool the room down as we were so warm the night before the answer was no but we could have a fan i said no because i did not want to risk waiting
