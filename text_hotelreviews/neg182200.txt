quality of accommodation was poor in view of how expensive the hotel is the room was worn down a lot we had problems with the toilet during the entire stay despite asking hotel staff to fix it the cheap alarm clock in the room was still set on winter time light switch in room lobby was broken so the light kept switching on automatically during the night also staff at breakfast seemed to pay more attention to either larger groups or regular guests and made mistakes as a result eg not bringing one of us the meal we orderered or bringing totally burnt bread
