there were few porters in front of the hotel but when we arrived no one asked us about helping i m pregnant and was using a crutch so it could be very nice if one of them ask us to help because it was very hard to hold my year old daughter with one large suitcase and push chair with a crutch when we went to inside the hotel finally one of porter asked us for bringing our luggage and push chair to our room so we were not happy with the first service from claridge s also my daughter can walk so she could fall off from the baby cot and i feel the hotel isn t baby friendly enough i shouldn t compare with other hotel but hotel bristol five stared hotel in paris had amazing service and was very family friendly so i expected similar service from claridge s
