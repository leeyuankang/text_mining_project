we stayed for five nights and had to change room twice at the beginning we were arranged to a room facing the courtyard with this very noisy ventilation machine so we didn t sleep well for the first night after i complained the next day we were then arrange to a room facing the street and on the top floor but the cold water system didn t work properly and we couldn t really use the hot water since that would be boiling the next day without using any water for one night they got it fixed but on that night there was this weird noise coming from the roof it was so loud that we could feel the vibration so we didn t have a good night sleep for the third night and finally since i complained at the beginning they didn t take it seriously they upgraded us to a suite we finally had two good nights sleep but the whole experience was so tiring and unsettled i can understand that such an old and famous hotel is hard to maintain but thought they had an expensive renovation not long ago the women in the first floor restroom was so ridiculously rude i have never experienced anything like that definitely didn t expect that would happen in claridge s
