whenever we travel the first place i look at is booking com and we nearly always book through this site because of that i feel it only poignant to say a few home truths re this hotel our room was very average with a hotchpotch of old furniture we were right above the bar and entrance so incredibly noisy there was blood on the sheets where the maid had had a cut finger we assume but all complaint taken very seriously and dealt with well we will go back again as long as we are not put in room
