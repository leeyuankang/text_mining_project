we checked in on line thinking this would speed things up how wrong was i check in took longer it system not playing well key card reader not working receptionist rebooted system twice what farce then we where upgraded to junior suite like all the corridors room was dark and unwelcoming carpet was on of the most uncomfortable pieces of material i have ever walked on carpet had been ripped and covered in masking tape doors to cupboards and bathroom where tatty from poor maintenance the hotel has a theme of unsung black as standard colour scheme which works if hotel has abundance of natural light to counter the dank appearance this hotel does not have enough that corridors you walked down can t see where your going can t see room numbers easy you walk along this black corridor and you get disorientated where you are loose your way horrible feeling people may like this and other rooms might be different but room was very poor as a junior suite room was not worth the money will never stay here again
