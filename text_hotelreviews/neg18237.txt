our room was situated on the ground floor as it had a delightful terrace however the plants were just dull and even some were dead no colour and yet what an opportunity to really wow your guests with area that could be filled with scent colour from climbers at very little cost in addition to this because we had to pass the kitchen entrance and the door was always open the smell and heat hit you as you were walking down there was always staff standing in the doorway and even if you said hello they would just look at you and carry on talking to each other so it made you feel a little uncomfortable we did have some previous guests smelly socks left in one of the draws but one call to reception and the actual lady on the desk came and dealt with it straight away
