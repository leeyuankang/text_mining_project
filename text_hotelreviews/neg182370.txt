whilst there was a good connection to wi fi the hotel s local packets did not always allow for a stable connection or made it very slow my partner is an it technician and checked the specifics whilst our room was a superior it did not allow for the the placement of an open suitcase let alone suitcases had to be placed on bed to open and then closed in order to find space on floor this would apply if you had only one small case as well very dark corridors with unusual array of steps could hear footsteps and all other noises from room above had a high bath could be a plus but could make it difficult for those less able to access the shower which is over the bath very little protection from water from shower spilling over to bathroom floor
