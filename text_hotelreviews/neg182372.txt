breakfast quality was poor and the restaurant staff didn t seem to be sure what they were doing first morning waited over for coffee and for our breakfast which was over cooked and had items missing we didn t complain as we had waited long enough and already witnessed the staff making a few other mistakes with other customers if i chose to stay here again i definitely wouldn t pay for breakfast here
