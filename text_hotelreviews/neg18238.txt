excellent hotel normally however this is a one off had it not been for a quick turnaround from the previous guests they would have normally spotted a broken glass in the bathroom also the breakfast tray didn t have any croissants as they had run out staff need to more understanding of their guests as their english isn t brilliant manage was very nice though
