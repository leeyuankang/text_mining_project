my room was a good size but very dark and with no opportunity to open a window as the bedhead was against the window i even had difficulty pulling down the blind and there it stayed for the entirety of my stay my major problem was that the desk staff member took a pre authorisation on my card for all rooms booked even though the accounts were being paid for by each individual room guest and then refused to reverse the amount for the duration of my stay which severely limited my spending while in london no apologies were offered and at check out they debited the cost of my room and the pre authorisation amount took another days to be reversed this ruined a potentially happy times for me
