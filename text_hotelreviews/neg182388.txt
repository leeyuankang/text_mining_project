i was charged twice on a preauthorisation for the total cost of my stay and that was not reversed during my day stay the staff blamed the credit card company but nothing to release almost a that i was unable to spend during my holiday due to their mistake gross incompetence and no customer service skills displayed at all days later and days after leaving the amount is still on my card no mention of full prepayment at the time of check in and it was suggested that this was a precaution against me not settling my account treated like a criminal with no parole period never ever again will i either stay here not will i ever recommend the hotel to anyone despite its great location
