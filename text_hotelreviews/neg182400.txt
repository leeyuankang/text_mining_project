when i returned from the evening out the room was boiling hot i called reception and nothing was done finally at i got up to go to reception as i could not sleep and they realised they had the room set to hot and with no apology or concern for our sleep it took about another hour for the room to cool but honestly i ve stayed in holiday inns for half the price and are far better
