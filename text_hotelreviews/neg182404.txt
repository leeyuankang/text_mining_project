the staff where very unhelpful from the start of our trip the hotel just seemed to have gotten worse the room was already paid in full on arrival we had to pay for the room again they said they would refund the booking com payment back in working days my work colleague was also staying in the same hotel and stayed in a double room whilst mine was a deluxe double room their room was much large than mine i found this strange as i had paid almost extra the hotel also turned the water off for most of a day we had an awards ceremony to attend at and the water just came on at
