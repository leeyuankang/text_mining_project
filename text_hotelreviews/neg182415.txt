i thought for what we paid did not reflect what we got the service in the restaurant is poor with poor english understanding from the staff i asked for a newspaper and received a menu it was obvious there was a low patronage in the restaurant service cost and time receiving meals needs to be looked at if you want to be a high end hotel the blind cord in our room was broken which i advised the front desk and was later told that they sent someone to look at the fridge and that it was ok i then advised that my husband had fixed the blind as it was days later there was nothing wrong with the fridge
