we need to leave our huge suitcase when we trip to spain but the manager of this hotel refused it because we were not coming back to their hotel eve though we stayed for long time and checking out and coming back again during two weeks and introduced many friend to stay their hotel i would suggest to them that the customer service should not be followed manual all the time but they must be flexible to being as customer centric otherwise they never create a competitive customer experience in the future
