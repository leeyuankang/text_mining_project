narrow room some of staffs were very bad and didn t understand customer service when we asked to keep our small baggages until we come back to london due to our short trip to outside london they rejected our request as we guests from japan statyed more than nights and spent so much money at this hotel they did not keep our baggages because of no pammision from their manager we asked them many times but they didn t confirm their manager and told us that their priority was their manager and not customers they didn t care costumer experience and expected us to use again it was ver bad and disappointing experience for us we will never stay this hotel and will not recommend to use
