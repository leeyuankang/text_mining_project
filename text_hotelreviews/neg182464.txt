premises were good in great location but we purchased this in advance and paid in full as wedding gift for our niece on arrival they refused to let them check in as it was booked with our credit card my husband phoned from china where he was on business but they would only let them check in by paying again with their own card so they had to pay and we had to reimburse them urgently as they had no money after wedding in italy never had this problem before and even with a crying bride in reception they were prepared to toss them out with nowhere to go definitely not recommend them to anyone it was bad and unfair treatment of guests who were on their honeymoon
