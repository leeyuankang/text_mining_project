breakfast was poor not good value for money both in terms of quantity and quality there was not tea and coffee making facility in the room apparently for safety reasons however it is now standard to find this in a hotel in london the staff was polite and available but in some cases slow and not clumsy coffe with no spoon or sugar cappuccino instead of latte etc
