people used to modern motel suites might find the rooms small and the building old fashioned but i thought the building charming and the room just right for someone who plans to be out and about all day i don t like the new addition of dinner service because the kitchen smells waft up to the rooms and there are plenty of restaurants nearby the only complimentary toiletries were a very basic shampoo conditioner and soap it would make the room instantly more luxurious if they offered more
