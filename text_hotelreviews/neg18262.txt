the air conditioning unit did not work requests from the in room menu were always not available except persian choices i was informed the restaurant is persian now and only items from the banu menu are available that menu which was added to the rear of the in room folder also listed the cranley burger fish chips and all other items on the in room menu however as stated above such items were not available on the three occasions i used room service despite being listed as an available item there was no bath robe should one wish to have a coffee or tea in your room it is necessary to order it via room service the choice available for the basic breakfast was poor so i went to a well known grocers on piccadilly for breakfast
