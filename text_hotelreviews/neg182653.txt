we changed rooms three times we had booked a king room but had been downgraded to a queen the room wasn t great and the bathroom very dated with a window that didn t close the second room was non smoking but smelled of cigarette smoke and again wasn t good the third room was fine but the bathrooms are so dated we had however booked a classic room if booking i would advise to pay the extra for a contemporary room a lot of work is needed on the classic rooms to bring them up to standard
