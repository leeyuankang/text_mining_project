this was out of the hotel s control but there was a large construction project directly adjacent to our room it would have been nice to have been notified about this before arriving so we could have asked for a room away from it there is apparently a school s playground adjacent to the hotel and our room so the sounds of young boys at play in the mornings coupled with the ongoing heavy construction made for an unusual wake up calls each weekday morning maybe the hotel should consider updating its room windows to be more modern energy efficient and sound proof
