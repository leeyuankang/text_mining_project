the a c kept turning off and had to get up twice during the night to turn it on couldnt open windows as i must have been over the kitchen and kept hearing bottles getting thrown into what must be a dumpster it should be noted that i did not ask the hotel to look at the ac i just dealt with it the service was great so i m sure they could have fixed it overall a good hotel
