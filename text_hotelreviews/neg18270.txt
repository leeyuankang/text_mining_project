everything sadly this hotel trades on its location and photographs i ve stayed in much better bed and breakfasts i can only assume the star rating is self appointed no one answered the phone when i called prior to arrival to ask about parking of which there is none when we did arrive the receptionist was so devoid of human emotion i assumed he was a badly automated robot the first room had a chinese water torture device constantly dripping gurgling ac unit fitted as an unwelcome addition the second room lacked basics like tea coffee a kettle etc the position of our executive room was in the basement next to the kitchen so we were woken at on a sunday by the chef juggling the crockery breakfast was a joke having paid extra for an inclusive breakfast we were told we only qualified for the continental breakfast which was a basket of luke warm limp bread optimistically described as toast and a cafetiere filled with dishwater equally optimistically described as coffee anything beyond that including cereals was additional the service at breakfast was appalling i was unsure at which point beadle was going to jump out and let me in on the gag its a beautiful building but as a hotel its trading on its south ken credentials very hard any where else it would struggle
