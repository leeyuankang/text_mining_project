the bathroom in our room was a disappointment it was dated and small with a small bath and shower over the bath definitely not quality the spa facilities consisted of small female only and male only changing rooms which each contained a small sauna and person steam room there was no pool and the lack of shared area means it is not ideal for couples wishing to use the spa together i mentioned at the time of booking and when checking in that it was our wedding anniversary and asked whether they might do something to make the room special they did not make even a small gesture to help us make it special and did not acknowledge the request such as giving us a particularly nice room or including a complementary glass of champagne either of which would have been nice we had booked a table at the bank restaurant which is attached to the hotel courses a couple of glasses of wine and a shared desert came to but the food was below par under seasoned and over priced the breakfast which was included in the room rate was a buffet style and was below average the scrambled eggs were mushy and mushrooms under seasoned and the selection of hot food wasn t great our bathroom the spa facilities and the quality of the food left a lot to be desired for a hotel
