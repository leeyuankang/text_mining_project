we had a classic double the room was a good size for london not luxurious and it was on the uk floor on the other side of the hotel getting to it from the lobby elevators was a long trek through a maze for plus quid night i expected nicer we figured out how to get to our room directly using the small service elevator by the hair salon staff won t tell you about it the double bed was small hard neither slept well the room temp ranged from too hot to too cold the air blew down on the bed and i woke with a cold the bathroom was marble but has seen far better cleaner days the toilet didn t work properly
