the noise we were next to a housekeeping cupboard that seemed to be in constant use we were disturbed during the evening and night by a persistently creaking door the receptionist thought it was probably caused by a breeze through the fire door sunday afternoon i needed to rest but the noise from the rooms above was awful sounded like laundry trucks being rolled around i wouldn t recommend this hotel and frankly feel the for a two night stay without breakfast was excessive very disappointing
