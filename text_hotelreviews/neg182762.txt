although this was my fifth time at this nice hotel nothing was done to welcome me back no note from the manager no gift nada i notified several of the front desk clerks that this was my fifth time but they did nothing in fact some of them seemed annoyed the last few times i was there i always received a courteous note from the manager waiting in my room hotels must recognize loyal customers maybe the manager was on vacation
