i got an old room that was really not ready to be rented out toilet did not flush alright tap did not run more than a trickle mini bar did not open chair seat was broken looking out on a building site i had requested a view should have been specific in the end they moved me to a larger room which was much nicer but still very old fashioned and worn the hotel is progressively upgrading its rooms so i understand they advertise and show the new rooms on their website and booking com etc but they they put you in old worn rooms really disappointing
