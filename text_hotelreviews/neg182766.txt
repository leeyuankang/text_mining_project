we were a bit dissatisfied with our check in experience we had contacted the hotel not once but twice regarding our request for an early check in we asked for noon as opposed to as my wife needed to go to a foot procedure nearby and she needed to scrub her feet clean prior to leaving for the clinic upon arrival we were told the room was clean but not inspected yet we were then minutes later told that the room was in fact not ready nor had it been inspected minutes after that we were told that it was ready i explained to karen the gal who checked us in that we needed the bags immediately as the special soap my wife needed was inside several minutes went by before the bags arrived this all put us in a time crunch and the stress of this added to the stress of the day unfortunately upon check out again there was an issue we were asked if we wanted the additional charges about to be charged in euros or in gbp we thought it would be nice to have it charged in euros as our bank would not charge a fee that way so we said euros we were then given a receipt for my wife asked how much that was in euros since that was the currency we were charged in the gal at the desk said she did not know my wife asked her to find out she said she could not my wife asked again for her to find out the gal at check out asked a colleague and he said he could not give us a receipt in euros my wife replied that she did not need a receipt in euros but that she did need to know how much was charged in euros the fellow at reception then gave the gal who was helping us some instruction to look at a currency converter but the gal did not seem to know what she was doing or how to do that my wife then asked to speak to the manager on duty the gal went into the back for a few minutes and returned to let my wife know that the mod was on the telephone understand all of this was with my wife standing with crutches
