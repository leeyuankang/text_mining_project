when we arrived we had to pay more for a family room due to having kids and then pay extra for spare beds in rooms we did already say how many people we would have per room when booking after a long trip of adults and children travelling we paid the extra for the rooms but i wasn t happy about this at all when booking we provided all our information who would be in what room
