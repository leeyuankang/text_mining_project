we didn t get the room we paid for for the first night even when we got a better room for the second night we couldn t open the window due to noise from an air conditioner outside the window the first night room was clastrophobic with frosted window when we open the window we got piping and air conditioners in front of our window with constant noise the room had no bath as was promised on the room photos on the hotel website generally there was a shirking contrast between website photos and the room it was very disappointing especially taking into account that we booked the room months in advance
