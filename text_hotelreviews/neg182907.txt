i had prepaid in advance to be told on admission that my bill was an extra pounds i showed them my receipt and they still couldn t explain the extra cost but suggested it was a city tax when i asked them to please clarify exactly what the additional cost was a supervisor told me it was because i asked for a quiet room i was travelling with a small child so i don t know what they expected they finally agree it was already paid in full but brought us up a room in an area that is in need of a major facelift as the lift stopped working and the decor was dated and scruffy not what i expected from a hotel of this supposed standard
