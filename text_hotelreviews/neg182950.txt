initially we were over run with staff x three asking if we were comfortable dinner once served was lovely perfectly cooked the restaurant staff were too quick to clear the table away and clearly wanted us out of the restaurant though it was only we were the last people in the restaurant but even so when filling glasses the waitress continually only topped up one of the glasses when two of were drinking wine requested water which arrived and was placed on the side but rarely did the waitress top up the water glasses the spa closed too early
