on first morning of our stay when i ordered my breakfast i got phone call from the restaurant manager asking me why do i need so much of food confirmed with her that i need everything that i ordered and after minutes got another call from the cheif about the same thing i was asked so many questions about my breakfast that i had to cancel the order very disappointing no one got the right to ask a customer why want to eat certain things or quantity poor and disappointing
