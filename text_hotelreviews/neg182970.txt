our room was not the best we have stayed in and for we expected more our room overlooked the generators and they were very noisy especially at night when we opened our window for ventilation also there must have been a water tank above our room so all night we were kept awake by water noise in the morning we wanted to have a bath but the water was tepid and only just hot enough to have a shower instead
