on arrival we were offered help with our luggage which we politely declined however it would have been nice if the gentleman on reception had gone on to explain that there were a couple of steps in between the lift on the floor and our bedroom door we might have changed our mind the bar area is lovely but feels a little squashed into the back of the reception area and slightly unwelcoming but there s not a lot you can really do about that other than move it completely i would add that a cold breakfast at each even more if you wanted a cooked breakfast was very steep especially as there are numerous eateries in the area offering breakfast for far less i am sure the breakfast was sublime but at over a morning for the two of us it simply wasn t going to happen
