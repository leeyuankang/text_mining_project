by accident i left behind my ipad and charging wires on the desk in my room when i realized after check out that i had done this i called the hotel and was reassured that they had been found and would be held for me i am disturbed though that a hotel of this quality would not have called me immediately upon discovering my valuable item it certainly would have put me at ease and i might have been able to retrieve it before leaving for the airport
