i was upgraded against my wishes an amount was authorised on my card which was more than i had booked for i was told it would be refunded i then paid the agreed amount for the room the next day when i got home i realised the previous amount was still missing from my account i phoned the hotel and they said it was a system error in future i will be refusing all upgrades very loudly and clearly i paid over twice for my stay and am still waiting to be reimbursed
