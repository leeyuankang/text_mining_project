despite luxurious reception areas we found our bedroom to be tired bland and cramped none of the furniture matched and looked old and cheap there was far too much furniture so you couldn t move comfortably the gap between the end of the bed and chest of drawers was so tight you had to shuffle sideways to get through so much brown it was depressing even the teabags were disgusting a great disappointment
