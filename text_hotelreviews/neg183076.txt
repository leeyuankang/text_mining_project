i was so disappointed having stayed at the taj dubai i was really looking forward to my stay however the taj st james was a complete disappointment we were moved three times in ten days because we complained firstly because of the filthy room that we were put into classic studio then because of the noise from a guest in the room above and the third room was an upgrade to a contemporary style suite which smelt of smoke very very disappointing we should have been relocated to a better standard of room after the first room that we were allocated pubic hair visible in the bathroom suspicious staining on the couch and the bed cover the hotel is tired and needs a makeover the furnishings have past their best by a number of years
