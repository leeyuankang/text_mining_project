the room was tiny we stayed in room which was on a corner the bed wasn t even a full size double i m and my feet were almost hanging off the edge the room was clean and tidy but very very dated the bottom half of the window was painted up and the top half looked out onto a cladded wall having paid for the two nights i think that it is very poor value for money
