upon arrival the reception for some reason took a deposit out of my card which later on did not show on the room statement it was only after i upon return contacted credit control of the hotel that the issue was cleared such things are annoying time consuming and should not be necessary at a star hotel the size of the executive king room i had was not impressive although the window orientation towards a quiet yard and in different directions was a great plus i could have the windows open at night being only meters from the palace without being greatly disturbed by the regular sirens in london from the police and ambulances when walking inside the room wearing black socks i discovered quite some residuals from former guests in the room who must have been long haired blondes half of the king bed turned out to be broken or severely impacted by former activities which had crumbled the springs this can be looked at as an impressive feat but for me as a guest at a star establishment it is disappointing that it is not being reported by the maintenance staff and the room will be handed over to new clients in a non optimal state the hotel should probably also take better care of the technical installations having only two smaller lifts available for guests having one of them out of service during peak hours for checkout after the weekend is just irritating on the auxiliary side with the hotel in the location it has min walk from the house of fraser down buckingham gate it is slightly disappointing that the hotel does not go the extra mile no just a few feet really to enhance the guests experience by providing a discount arrangement for the house of fraser or similar
