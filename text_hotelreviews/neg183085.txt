our check in day was a nightmare we had to wait two hours for the room to be prepared and received the room key two hours later than the time indicated as the check in on on the hotel web site the receptionist a tall east indian man promised to call me on my cell phone when the room was ready after waiting for over an hour and a half and not receiving any calls i inquired about our room and a young lady stated to me that the room was ready the room initially assigned to us by the eastern indian receptionist was next to the corridor being painted the entire floor smelt like a construction site to make the matter worse once we entered the room we found two travel bags which belonged to someone else our travel bags to my astonishment had not been delivered to our room within two hours after the bags were picked up and we had to wait for the room clarifying the matter with the same eastern indian receptionist who promised to fight be our bags i requested a different room away from the area of the hotel being repainted well after the same gent gave us the key to the room on the top roof floor we found ourselves in a room much smaller that the room we reserved there was no mention of the price difference due to the size difference either still awaiting the bags to be found and almost three hours past the time we were supposed to be relaxing in our room after a long flight i finally had enough and asked to speak to the manager she was the only one who understood and immediately got involved and soon resolved the problems with missing bags and found a big nice room for us i am still stunned by that day as i never in my life has seen such a delay and such incompetence from the receptionist
