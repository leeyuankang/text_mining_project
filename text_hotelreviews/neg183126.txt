the hotel staff was not accommodating when it came to our rooms first they couldn t find our reservation so thank goodness i had my reservation confirmation then when we went to our rooms they were not close to what the picture entailed through the booking com website i believe i paid a lot of money to book the rooms i saw on their website and didn t even get close to it i complained to the hotel desk and basically was told that if i wanted the picture i would have to pay even more not impressed
