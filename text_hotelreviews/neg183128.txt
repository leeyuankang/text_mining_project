the room seemed very dated and i d expect a little more for my money if i stayed there again the tv was very small and slow reacting controls which isn t too bad if you re not using it too much two of the the windows wouldn t stay open when lifted which was quite annoying but you could argue that the air con compensates for this the charges for the items in the fridge is ridiculous for a can of cola is way over the top and not needed given the price of the rooms
