the room while spacious could use a bit of updating also i prepaid the room and when i called the taj was told by the taj to submit a prepay form on the form it requires you to tick a box selecting the set of room charges i followed directions and elected to add breakfast to the booking com rate i received the invoice thinking i was charged room rate plus breakfast however on checkin they only charged the room rate and did not add on breakfast the person at the front desk refused to acknowkedge the hotels mistake i think their prepay process was at fault because if i was going to be charged the room rate through booking regardless of what i selected why did i have to fillout the prepay form and tick my choice of addons other hotels would have been gracious and comped me the meal for the mixup here i was told sorry not our fault esp since on checkin they charged my card an additional pds as a deposit for any prepay room charges it seemed like they added insult to injury
