my husband was on crutches when we arrived yet the room we were checked into initially was probably the furthest away from the lift room and furnishings was very tired we had to ring to change which was dealt with there was a terrible smell in the corridor by the lift sewarage like smell for our entire stay wifi was a bit hit and miss i would rate the rooms as a standard which is disappointing considering the price and how impressive the lobby is
