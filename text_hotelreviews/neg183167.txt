service at breakfast was not as slick as it should have been staff did not seem to be watching out and had to be asked on a number of occasions to do things such as clear plates and top up coffee we noticed other tables having similar issues on successive days we noticed the serving bowls of food on the buffet were not being promptly replenished service in the evening though was great
