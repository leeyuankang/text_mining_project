please don t be fooled by the professionally taken bedroom photographs of this hotel to say it is dated is an understatement the reception area and courtyard are well maintained and are very relaxing but go through the foyer and past the doors to the rooms and you see the real hotel if this hotel was anywhere other than yards from buckingham palace it would be a star hotel at the very best the expense of staying here certainly does not reflect lack of quality with regard to comfort this hotel has to offer the room we were first given was b b standard so we asked to be given another room the management moved us to a room doors away down the hall which was equally as dated and alot smaller the staff were all excellent with exception to the original receptionist that checked us in no please or thank you and no directions to our room a complaint was made regarding other guests smoking on the floor and the smell coming into our room which was laughed at and answered with well they could be charged an extra all in all i d say the hotel would be or star in somewhere like spain but in london i m sorry to say there are better hotels for similar money
