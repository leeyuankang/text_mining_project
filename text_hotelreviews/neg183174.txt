keep in mind that this is a very old building that was updated as a result they had to work around some structural constraints the square footage was inaccurate from a usable space standpoint because they didn t subtract the thickness of the walls between to feet thick the furniture that they chose for the relatively small rooms was too big for the allotted space the bedroom had a strange table with a bench underneath that was totally unusable a smaller dresser would have been a huge improvement there is also a weird spotlight under the bathroom vanity that is pointed directly at the bed we had to improvise a paper cover over it to allow for a night light that wasn t blinding the towel warmer didn t work there was an awful smell every day in the ground floor elevator lobby
