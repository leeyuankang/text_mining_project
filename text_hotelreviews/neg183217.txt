breakfast arrangement confusing eggs had to be ordered therefore other hot food was cold on plate also when you order eggs why come with other accompaniments i hate hash browns but when i ordered an egg it came with hash brown and tomato wasteful and unnecessary otherwise breakfast was good would have loved a swimming pool which often is linked to a hotel that has a spa room generally good and clean but bathroom a little tired and dirty underneath soap dispenser i wouldn t have noticed but i had a soak in the bath after a long day walking and it clearly hadn t been cleaned for some time
