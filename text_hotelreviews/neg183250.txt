i booked the hotel middle of last year as my husband and i were celebrating a very special occasion i requested our room view to be the best and hoped that this request was not a problem with giving lots of notice unfortunately the room was very nice but the view was office blocks i reall don t know if the type of room i booked classic king actually housed any views other than what we had it didn t spoil our time there but i was a little disappointed
