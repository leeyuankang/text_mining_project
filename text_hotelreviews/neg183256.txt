everything was extremely old everything except maybe some of the staff the hallways and especially our room felt ancient and worn extremely tired the paint jobs were less than half hearted and the crowning was gaping everywhere the bathroom seemed nice at first glance but nothing in the bathroom was sealed coulked properly so everything shifted even the bathroom counter the room felt like third rate coffee was free but nothing else was complimentary the room was full of extra things to buy the bed was atrocious as soon as i laid in it the only thing i could think i wonder how many countless people have slept her before it was basically two individual ruts once you laid down you were stuck in the rut extremely uncomfortable i know it s not a huge deal but at one point i needed a coffee and it took the barista minutes to make a coffee from an espresso machine but at least it wasn t horrible one of the worst parts terrible conditions aside was that there was this trainee that was helping us now the trainee herself was extremely kind and gracious as there had been an issue with the booking of our room being too small to fit an extra bed but what was absolutely unacceptable was that the other experienced staff was incredibly rude to her she obviously needed a tiny bit of guidance on her first week policies and uncommon things pop up in any work environment and the customer should never ever have to witness another employee belittling his co worker this was outrageous and the employee should be let go behavior unbecoming of any staff member in the least the experienced member wasn t helpful in answering any of her questions or guiding her in what the process was and how to amend it truly unacceptable i would never stay here again not if i was invited back for free
