we booked two rooms adjoined but did not realise that we had booked old tired rooms looked at title pics and thought that is what we were getting possibly a booking com issue and our year old son was not happy with his room and felt unconformable also the toilet was not clean in one of our initial rooms we spoke to front desk and they were very helpful and happy to upgrade for another for each room the issue was that they were not connected so my wife had to be with our son and i was on the opposite side of the corridor the new rooms were really nice and modern and very clean the only issue was the shower which was more of a trickle and for some strange reason the lifts were freezing cold it was a hassle and i probably would not want to go back but in fairness my wife really liked the new rooms and she would go back the front desk staff were very good and could not have been more helpful
