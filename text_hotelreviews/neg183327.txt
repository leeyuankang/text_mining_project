this is really a minor quibble but the service in the bistro restaurant was ever so slightly off the servers seemed a bit off their game when we chose from the a la carte menu rather than the prix fixe and it took a little while to get to the table although we were the only table in the house otherwise the food was quite good and the service became very attentive everything else about our stay was pretty much perfect
