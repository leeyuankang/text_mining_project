cleanliness left something to be desired seemed to be a general who cares concerning upkeep of the entire hotel examples there is a lot of brass in the lobby and none of it had been cleaned it was covered in fingerprints and had an overall dirty appearance the bathroom in our suite was dirty there were visible spots on the bide and the shower had some not much but still black mold after leaving a nice note requesting some deeper cleaning i finally took care of it myself it was obvious that housekeeping did as little as possible
