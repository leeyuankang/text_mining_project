the bank restaurant most of the staff do not know when it is open when the kitchen is open and seem completely unaccommodating despite trying to be seen so they burnt the steak with god knows what and looked gobsmacked when told it was inedible would you like something else absolutely not thankfully they took the steak and drink off not really enough
