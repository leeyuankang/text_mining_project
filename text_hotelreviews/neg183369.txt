i stayed in the taj in cape town so thought we would give this one a try unfortunately not to the same standard very long corridor walk to the room which is not a problem but is like walking in a nursing home dreary lacks any finesse the room was ok the furniture could do with upgrading it just all looks tied worn i would not recommend the breakfast i do not like queuing for food have sufficient tables for your guests once seated had to scramble around to find our own cutlery cups milk than request tea and toast after a long wait not value for money
