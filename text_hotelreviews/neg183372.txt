i was disappointed with the room we were allocated it was a little on the small side but the biggest disappointment was that it was in the corner of the building with absolutely no view the bottom half of the window was opaque and what we could see from the top half of the window overlooked the side of a building which was clad in corrugated iron the trip had been a surprise for my husband s birthday and i had hoped that the room would be more impressive than it was
