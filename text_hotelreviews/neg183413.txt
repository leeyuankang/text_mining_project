we booked for a king bed room however a twin room with two single beds was provided an immediate change of room could not be provided without paying extra to upgrade the room the room has funny smell which was not pleasant the house keeping staff was kind and helpful who combined the two single beds together to make a double bed however the overall experience was disappointing given the price we paid
