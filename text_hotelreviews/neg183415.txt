before you read this remember for the tiniest of rooms it was gbp euros a night we were booked by trainee eduardo into the worst hotel room i ve ever stayed in london room it s a room you would be upset if the staff had to sleep in if they were on call let alone the paying customers i was a loyal customer of taj having spent time in their lovely hotels in india and i have stayed many times at this hotel but never again i was assured at check if that i had been upgraded as i had on previous occasions instead i have been downgraded to the wellness suite wing of the hotel that was unclean the stairs looked like they had never been cleaned painting was going on crashing and banging was happening every morning the bed was like a very small temporary bed and squeaked with every movement the fixtures and fittings looked like they came from the or all the toiletries have been changed as part of some cost cutting exercise since the last time i stayed and are cheap and difficult to open there was no turn down service on either nightwe ate breakfast on our last morning at the hotel and regretted it manageress was moody unhelpful and rude waitress left us to the self service buffet and we had to chase her to be offered the menu to order a non buffet option poached eggs which were overpowered by too much vinegar in the cooking water please stay at horseguards hotel or cheval quays much nicer star hotels they remember their regular loyal customers so much has changed from my last stay they must have changed the management
