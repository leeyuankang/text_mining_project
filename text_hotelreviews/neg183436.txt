we were travelling with our month old son who has one bottle of formula a day we have stayed in several hotels and have always taken our microwaveable steriliser with us there has been no problem having this sterilised at any hotel we have stayed in i asked reception to microwave it for me and was told they were unable to do so for unspecified health and safety reasons incredibly the receptionist suggested i boil the bottle in the kettle in the hotel room we found an alternative solution the following day but would have been completely snookered had our son been exclusively bottle fed the hotel s unhelpful approach is not what i expected from a hotel of this calibre
