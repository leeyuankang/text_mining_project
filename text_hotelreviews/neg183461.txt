we paid a in advance for a room that was not available at our arrival they offered us a smoker s room as they said that was the only chance and we were tired we accepted it after unpacking our lugagge it turned out that it was impossible to remain there due to the heavy smelling smoke when we asked for a non smoking room the staff was really hostile they claimed they didn t have a room and we were treated as if we were the ones causing a problem to the hotel instead of accepting they were the ones that were not providing us a room for which we had already paid after a few very unfortunate minutes of discussion i asked to speak with the manager and lo and behold out of the blue a perfect non smoking room appeared for us
