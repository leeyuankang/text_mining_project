they put us in the wrong room the first night it was dirty and much smaller than what was shown on the booking web site after complaining they switched us to the correct room but no credit or apology was offered it reminded me of the old bait and switch game the hallways leading to the rooms had the smell of sewage and while i advised them of such i am sure they had been told many times they express surprise that the odor existed
