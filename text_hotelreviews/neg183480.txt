the rate on booking com is a bait and switch as soon as you arrive the front desk staff will begin to badger you about upgrading to a more expensive room they will describe it in ways that make you think you had better upgrade or you will be sorry and said they had very few so i d better take it now the room i booked didnt sound great so i wanted to upgrade but i was really trying to save money and so i said i thought i would be ok in the original room but the front desk staff managers will badger you and badger you until you just want to pay anything to get away from them the entire check in process took minutes this is not an exaggeration the worst of my life i was tired and began just agreeing with this manager but he would persist and ask you again and again to confirm that you have heard every detail i think it is a device to get you to pay the extra money i m hardly a novice traveller i stay over nights a year in hotels i changed rooms twice due to extreme smoke smell arrival can be dicey as taxi s don t know where to take you and can drop you off at the taj apartments across the courtyard and then you are made to feel like a heel when you turn up and your name is not on the list in that building free wifi is a joke so you have to pay for the higher priced wifi if you want to do anything and overall i would say i paid more per night than i bargained for again im an expert business traveller and these hucksters are really good at their game
