the talixo mozio taxi that i prepaid via booking com as a taxi partner to take my family from the airport to the hotel was a no show they claim they were there but they did seem to have a problem with time differences between london and berlin whatever their problem they were not there when we arrived as scheduled prebooked and prepaid after prolonged phone calls and emails an hour and half delay and no remedy offered i had to hire another taxi for the trip and paid twice approx prepaid then ie for the journey from the airport to the hotel this is not the hotels fault and i am sorry i am including this debacle in association with their good review they suggested that in future i contact them directly to arrange transport the next time i stay as our friends successfully did although i selected the taxi prebooking from a list provided by booking com as the hotel s booking partners the hotel said this was not who they use just a booking com list i suggest you avoid booking a taxi with talixo mozio which are actually based in berlin talixo and the us mozio this i only discovered when it became necessary to phone them when no taxi was waiting one appears to be the booking agent for the other so each blames the other and leaves you in the lurch and out of pocket
