the hotel has a lot to do to meet parisian hotel standards it wasn t pleasant at all waking in the early morning every day because of the staff making too much noise and the fact that it was easy to hear everything that was going on the floor due their thin doors after days in the hotel you just give up using the elevator and all the other guests too i don t know why but their elevator is extremely slow and one day it took minutes to get to my floor the spa is not operational when i went down to use the sauna it was turned off the staff couldnt help me until one recepcionist told me that i had to let them know hour before so i told them i would like to use it in hour after a while they told me it wasn t working another issue was with the check out we had rooms and wanted to stay until or pay for another day to stay until later the hotel was almost fully booked and they told me that they would be able to provide room until that time i asked them which one and they told me to choose between room or i chose after a while he calls me and tells me that only is available the whole hotel needs to be reshaped i ll never going back to this one and dont recomend it at all
