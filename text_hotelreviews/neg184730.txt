this hotel belongs to the fifties decoration service toilet amenities entrance and lobby very un comfortable for people who can not tolerate noise i was annoyed by the noise coming from a man coughing all night in the next room plus people talking in the street you basically should think of this place as bed and breakfast motel and not a four stars hotel
