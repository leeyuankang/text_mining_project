we always have to wait for our room this time we arranged a late arrival flight and requested to have the room ready we arrived at to the hotel the room was not ready we waited patiently till pm every time we complained we were told it will be ready soon finally the room became available after we realized that nobody had checked out and the reason was that nobody cared that the guest arrived on an overnight flight from overseas and needed to sleep
