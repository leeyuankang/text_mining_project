we had several logistic issues with our room the bathroom door could not be closed the water streams in the shower were partially blocked by limestone and the air condition did not work for the first two days while it was extremely hot in paris the hotel staff provided us a ventilator until the air condition was fixed the staff was very responsive to our complains and fixed all these problems they offered us our last night for free as a compensation
