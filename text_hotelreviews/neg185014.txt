we had to pay an extra charge for water in the rooms which usually if free in most hotels there was no coffee maker in the room break fast was complementary however if your orderd eggs or pancakes or toast etc you had to pay an extra charge there was a very loud sound in the water pipes sounded like someone was boling water i was transferred to another room it was an expensive hotel for what they had to offer in sure i could get something better for the same price
