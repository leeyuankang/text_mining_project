only complaint was that the beautiful shower didn t really work that well when we used the rain shower overhead function it flooded out into the room the drain didn t seem to able to keep up we were able to use the handheld sprayer but that didn t make for as nice of a shower one other thing worth mentioning is that this hotel is not on a charming side street or anything it is off of a very big street blvd saint michel which is noisy crowded and full of tourists and generic stores didn t bother us too much though since it was so central and easy to walk to tons of restaurants was steps from jardin luxembourg
