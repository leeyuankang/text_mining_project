the lift is extremely small which can fit person along with piece of medium sized luggage for me it was fine but for people with many pieces of luggages they would need various trips a stand to put in the soap shampoo etc in the shower area would be helpful the hand shower unit was very small and not satisfying i understand that this maybe to reduce water consumption but it s too small laundry service is too expensive
