the breakfast was worse than what i would expect at a simple b b or even a youth hostel and completely inappropriate for a hotel let alone one with a price tag like this one the fridge is of course gorgeous but the awful cramped and low quality no choices breakfast was shockingly not in keeping with the rest of the thoughtful details in the hotel the breakfast is unfortunately a huge deal breaker which will keep me from recommending the hotel whoch is sad as all other aspects deserve stars the breakfast deserves zero stars and i ve told people to skip it and get breakfast in the area i genuinely hope that the hotel owners will expand on a breakfast experience
