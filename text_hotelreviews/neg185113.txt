had this booked as a birthday present for a co worker agreed with the hotel in advance to be charged for the room from my card and also the hotel promised a box of french macaroons which never happened i have all email correspondence to prove to anyone that the hotel is nothing like to picture the communication is brilliant in email only not in real life and on top of that my friend has woke up in the morning with flooded toilet that was leaking somewhere from the back all night not to forget bland breakfast very very disapointed
