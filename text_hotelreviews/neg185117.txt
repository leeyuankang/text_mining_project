actually everything was more than perfect until the last day of our stay last day the lady at the reception desk asked me and my fiance that we need a taxi for airport transport we said ok and left the hotel to use our last day when we came back to take our luggages the driver was waiting for us inside the hotel due to my previous negative experiences as a tourist i asked the driver about the fee and offered him which was a fixed fee that we paid when we arrived the city the driver also confirmed the fee but on the highway he locked the doors of the car and threated us to pay additional we ended up the trip at the police station cause we did not want to pay an additional fee that we did not ever talked before we were already missing our flight to istanbul cause the issue was not resolved even in the police station so i called the hotel to asked them being witness cause all the negotiation process before the trip occured infront of the lady at the reception unfortunately we did not get enough support from her and we had to pay in order to catch our flight we really felt cheated and just writing this comment to warn everyone please be aware about the taxi company that the hotel is in cooperation
