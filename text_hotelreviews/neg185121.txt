the wifi is advertised as free but don t expect it to work also don t expect the management or the hotel personnel to do anything about it when you bring it to their attention we observed the front desk staff giving us the impression that it was a known problem that has never been addressed we would have been more than happy to pay for wifi as it is such a useful service when traveling if we knew about it beforehand we would have chosen a different hotel at the end of our stay we tried to get some compensation for the inconvenience of not having a functional network but it was refused everything else was fairly average reasonable i would say with the plenty of choices offered nowadays by airbnb and more guest friendly hotels think twice before booking this one
