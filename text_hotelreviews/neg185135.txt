we had booked x single rooms for our business trip on arrival were told one of our rooms was double booked as the staff had printed out the booking form on a double sided page and only booked one room realizing their mistake only the day before our arrival however no one called us in advance of our arrival we were told a room had been booked at another hotel just round the corner the substitute hotel was good but it was disappointing that we were not in the same hotel and added unnecessary check in time to our already busy trip we should have been told when the mistake was spotted
