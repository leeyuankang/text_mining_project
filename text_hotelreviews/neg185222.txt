details of room hard to get to plugs shower is like a flood on your head the staff should stay in the hotel rooms for a few nights to see how they could improve the rooms desk chair legs are old won t move you trip over them light bulbs out very old blow dryers for hair small details i m only noting because they say they re a star hotel feels like less did not like the hotel being so small hotel is actually only on one floor the floor no real lobby or bar area breakfast lunch dinner cocktails all served in executive lounge small narrow halls to rooms overall a bad value for the will probably try a different hotel next time
