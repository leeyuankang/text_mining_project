there was no knowledgeable concierge each person assigned that position for the day looked on the internet for the information i could have been the concierge as i knew more than the staff i got incorrect opening information which could have sent me out hours early before fortnums opened luckily i waited and went to a museum instead on a sunday morning this is called a luxury hotel you pull up to the hotel in a taxi and nobody opens the taxi door and if somebody is on the phone you must wait for the front hotel door to open as they are involved in conversation sometimes the staff from the rubin s comes out and opens your taxi door you also don t know when you have to pay for a cup of tea and when it is included as there is an abundance of free food almost all day long i admit my comments were listened to and this situation may be amended by now never have i had someone personally listen to my comments as they did here and that is really noteworthy
