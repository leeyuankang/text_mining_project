having stayed at many top hotels in london overall found this hotel a disappoint for all the rave reviews room was very poor dark basic and the tv was really far away awkward angle from bed also not given any sweets complimentary snacks like the description suggested no one informed us breakfast was complementary also room service ordered was cold and croutons stale
