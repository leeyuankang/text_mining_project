first room offered didn t have a bath as per our booking it was next to the entrance and very noisy both from traffic and from the receptionist talking on the phone the second was up flights of stairs but there are no lifts in the building breakfast was great but there was the danger of being run over while crossing a busy road getting to it there is no restaurant or bar on the premises fire safety was great galvanised sprinkler pipes run throughout the building suspended from the ceiling in full view in a star hotel i would expect to see only the nozzles placed discreetly through the ceiling two of the spindles on the stairs to our room were broken presenting a safety hazard to small children
