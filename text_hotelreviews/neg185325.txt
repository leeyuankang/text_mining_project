there was no lift and my room was at the very top floor the fact that there was no lift was not clear when i was making the booking also i was told at the time of booking that my card would not be charged prior to my arrival but when i arrived at the hotel it had already been charged this was an inconvenience also when i made the reservation it stated that breakfast was not included so i made other arrangements whilst when i arrived at the hotel i was told by the staff that breakfast was included for me that was the third inconsistency that i would have preferred not to encounter i told the staff that they needed to ensure booking was aware of these but they told me that i had to take this up with booking myself
