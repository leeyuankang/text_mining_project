this not a four star hotel at all the room is normal there no elevator the room are not sound proof the shower was leaking for a very very long time after using it and many other things overall this not a four star hotel and doesn t worth the value when a i visit the city i found out many hotels around the property with the same value or very letter more but it s very much better than shaftesbury suites
