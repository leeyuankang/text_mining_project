i recall the hotel information saying there was no lift only floors when said done but the stairs are tricky if you do not have full mobility and that should be a little more prominent however the staff did help with our luggage without being asked and that was a great help also breakfast is taken at a sister property approx yards up the street which needs to be highlighted we were lucky in that it was cold but clear when it s raining it could be problematic are umbrellas provided in that circumstance may be a nice touch
