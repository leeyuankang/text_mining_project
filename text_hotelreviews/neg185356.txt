with valid booking they did not have any room so that upgraded us to montcalm great cumberland street which is not stars but stars max with window to internal corridor only noisy and you cannot open the door as it is blocked by the bed room you cannot see of the tv from the bed as it isbehind the wall so why such a big tv room the ventilator in the bathroon did not work all days so it was difficult and uncomfortable for use in none of the rooms safes worked for days and all of them were removeable as these were not connected to anything finally they repaired two of them but then batteries finished in both of them and had to be repaired again problem was that we were waiting for our computers for more than hours as the pre prepared push buttons on the phone did not work but there was no info that you should push instead and you do not expect that as it worked in the third room room so montcalm is very bad experience they reported to have problems with our credit card but the bank confirmed in writing that they even did not try as there is not any evidence in the bank
