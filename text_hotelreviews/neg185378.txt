although we had checked the day before and everything was ok when we arrived saturday we were told the rooms were double booked and the receptionist was uninterested in our problem the next approx couples that arrived were all told the same the manager wanted to ship us to a hotel the other side of london only the fact they had debited my card the day before got them to put us in a sister hotel down the road the room was tiny by the time all this was sorted we missed the first of our concert i wouldn t be surprised if our original rooms were given to a wedding party at their neighbouring hotel
