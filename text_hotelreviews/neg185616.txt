the main thing which disappointed us greatly was the size of our room we booked a superior double room there was nothing superior about it as soon as we opened our door the bed was two steps ahead we had to walk side ways around the bed if not we banged into the tv wardrobe and walls nowhere to place suitcases me and my partner couldnt get dressed beside eachother as there just wasnt enough room bathroom was also tiny me and my partner are not large people and our legs were touching the tiled wall beside us when sitting on the toilet shower was also disappointing just dribbles of water and the shower head kept falling off the bed was extremely hard but me and my partner are used to a soft bed however the pillows were awful very flat and uncomfortable no air con in the room which was definetely needed couldnt imagine what it would have been like if it had gotten any warmer outside fan was provided though however nice the welcome and people were the room completely ruined our stay when you pay over a night you expect alot better and can say that we would not consider this hotel again which is a shame because the location is brilliant
