the room was ridiculously small we couldn t fit our bags in there with us it was a joke i also didn t like that we seemed to become second class citizens when it was discovered that we booked through booking com we were told that was the reason why we were not allowed to partake in breakfast even though i didn t enquire about it because i knew that it wasn t included in this booking it leaves an bad taste
