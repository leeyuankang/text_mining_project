i didn t like the fact there was no air conditioning and we had to request a fan as one wasn t automatically provided despite the temperature being you couldn t have slept with the windows open due to the road noise from cromwell rd there was no iron or ironing board in the room which i have not encountered in some years in hotels of that rating we did ask reception for both these items as we needed to change to go out but an hour later we were still waiting when you are only there for the day and overnight an hour is a long time they need to put a shelf somewhere in the bathroom as there was nowhere to put your toiletries the cost of the breakfast is really high higher that other hotels we have stayed in in london we bought one from a patisserie around the corner for a quarter of the price there is also a starbucks and a pub within mins that offers breakfast
