the room furniture was a little dated showing chips along the edges etc and the room size was a bit of a disappointment especially as i had booked a superior room there is only one small lift so waiting to get downstairs in the morning required about a ten minute wait the cost of breakfast seemed excessive at for the full version especially as you can have breakfast down the road forhalf the price at garfunkels
