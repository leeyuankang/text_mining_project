arrived at was given keys to room waited a long while for lift as very small and lots of people staying there we get to floor and there is no anywhere to be found we had to get ready as attending the olivier awards at the royal albert hall but had to walk down as lifts in use and i have heart condition and told reception and they said yes there was no room it is so why say it is and put on card that number had to walk up the flights to room and instead of relaxing leisurely i was out of breath anyway we complained to manager and gave us complimentary breakfast ironically we left behind our phone charger lead and called and they said would email us if found and within half an hour they did to say it was found but would you believe that on email said room which doesn t exist
