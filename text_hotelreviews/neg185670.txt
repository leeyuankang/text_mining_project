tiny cramped bedroom no room to walk around bed it was squeezed into the corner of the room i stayed one night so it was ok but it wouldn t be comfortable for a long stay for someone with more baggage sound travels through the walls too if you re happy paying extra for something more luxurious this probably wouldn t be as much of an issue
