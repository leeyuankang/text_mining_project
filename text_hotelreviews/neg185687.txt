our room this year was even smaller than last year which we thought was impossible yes we only use it to dress and sleep in but our bathroom at home is larger than the bedroom and shower room it should have a warning that it is not suitable for larger people however it was clean so no complaints on house keeping i was dissapointed at the lack of christmas decorations considering the time of year the staff were polite and yes we would consider coming again depending on how much a larger room would cost and hopefully experience breakfast
