the first room we were given was on the floor awful room tiny and claustrophobic thankfully we asked to change and were given a nice room on the floor no comparison but there was a big gap under the door and unfortunately the lift was right outside the door we heard ever sound and conversation from outside the room including the guest in the room next door mediatating at also every cleaning store cupboard was open when we passed through the hotel look awful and unsightly the concierge bar staff hadn t a clue i asked for a coke one evening and i was given the bottle no glass no ice another evening i asked for a brandy and the barman had no idea what i was asking for or how to serve it my husband also asked for a brandy but there was none left i got the last brandy
