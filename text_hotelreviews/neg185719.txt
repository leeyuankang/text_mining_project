the inside of the hotel was very cramped up like the lift can barely take people there was no proper ventilation inside the room and since my visit was during summer i was roasting inside the room despite the window open the staff seemed very unfriendly i wouldn t say this hotel is star doesn t look so grand like in the pictures
