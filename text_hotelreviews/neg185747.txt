in my opinion overall the hotel looks shabby and doesn t feel like a star hotel for the same price you could probably find a star hotel with far better facilities and overall atmosphere i didn t like that i was asked to pay for the whole stay at arrival not sure if that was just me or is it the hotel policy the room was very small i believe it s much smaller than advertised meters i had to step out of the shower to shave my legs as there was just not enough space and there are no shelves in the shower at all which is very inconvenient also i felt that shampoo and shower gel were of not a very good quality so that i had to buy my own which has never happened before overall probably won t come back to this one
