we had booked a superior double room but it was obvious it was a twin room as it was two twin beds pushed together we were offered a complimentary english breakfast out of the blue which was lovely but unfortunately the breakfast wasn t lovely the toast was cold and the food was very poor we went out for breakfast instead
