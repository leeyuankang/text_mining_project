needed a fridge bathroom needs a heated towel rail or heater of some sort as gaps in window made bathroom freezing main window also very draughty not a problem in summer but winter different story was disappointed by size of room as was supposed to be a superior twin room which looks a lot bigger on the photo we had suitcases and had to store them along side between the bed and window door to room kept sticking had to get help on occasions to open it not impressed really as this is not what i would expected from a luxury hotel disappointed
