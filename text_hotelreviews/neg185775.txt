we had booked a single room and a twin room we were allocated rooms on the fifth floor the single room was of adequate size but the only window in the room was too high to see out of making the room feel claustrophobic the twin room was poky there wasn t even room to pull the chair out from under the desk without it hitting the beds and in my opinion this should only have been a single room some of the decor is looking shabby and the carpets worn although the hotel was all very clean there is one very small lift in the hotel it was not what i expected from a four star hotel which i had booked for a treat for my mum s birthday
