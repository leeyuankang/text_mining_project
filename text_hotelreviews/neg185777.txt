students overtook the bar and myself and my friend just about got seats to eat they were lounging around not eating or drinking and were very loud a couple tried to come into the bar but couldn t because there were no seats for them felt the students could have been managed better maybe a more senior person should have been responsible for the bar barman left the bar for long periods of time and in fact when we wanted to order a drink it was too late by the time he came back to the bar as we were heading off to a show
