i had requested on my booking a quiet room so that i could sleep well i also requested on arrival imagine my delight when i had two spanish groups next door who talked loudly in the corridor outside the room and constantly went in and out of each room letting the doors slam i hung the do not disturb door sign on the door to no avail i reported the next morning on check out that the doors needed to be adjusted as they slammed very loudly it is not necessary for any door to slam especially where door closures are fitted the mattress was too firm to sleep comfortably on i didn t get much sleep at all the pillows were flat i had to use
