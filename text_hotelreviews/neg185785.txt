we booked what was called a superior double room we had a tiny double bedded room in basement really only suitable for single occupancy the space between the end of the bed and the wall was a matter of inches and you had to bend over the bed to avoid hitting the tv also we elected to include breakfast at a cost of each assuming it was a good cooked breakfast at that price in fact it was only a rather poor continental breakfast cooked breakfast was each at booking you did not specify type of breakfast definitely thought this a rip off
