unfortunately i found a big bug in my room i thought it came through the window because i had left open the whet some fresh air i slept the first night the next day in the morning i found another one i collected and shared with the stuff they called the manager but she didn t even wanted to talk to me on the phone for an apology i left the hotel of course also the stuff is not well trained and very poor in english at the concierge one of the stuff didn t know the differences between j and g while i was trying to give a postal code i don t recommend this hotel for many reasons also when you check in they want you to pay in advance for the whole amount which seemed very unusual when i wanted my money back they cut the of the night they didn t seemed sorry at all
