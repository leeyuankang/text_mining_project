when we checked in at reception we were told there was a problem we were told to wait in the bar area the receptionist then came and said instead of a superior double room only two single rooms were available i said i d booked a double room in advance it was my husband s th birthday and she had better sort it out this was very upsetting and stressful after making a special trip in to london the receptionist disappeared again and came back minutes later and miraculously a room was available i complained at the time and was told there was an error in the system and then by another member of staff that some people had wanted to stay an extra night so they were prepared to accept that instead of honouring our booking this was a very bad start and impression to our stay the tv in our room was not working and a member of staff couldn t fix it at breakfast it said continental breakfast but there were no croissants or pastries some staff did not speak very good english and had a bad attitude the location and overall comfort was good
