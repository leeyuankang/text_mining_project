i have stayed in grange hotels before and this one is by far the lesser of the group the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful but the overal hotel disappointed the room was okay but the bathroom was ridiculously small why anybody thought it was a brilliant idea to have to crawl over the toilet to get into the shower is anybody s guess though i do appreciate that it is an old mansion and you have use the room you have in the room itself there was nowhere to put any clothing the furniture was rickety and behind the door there was a little cubby hole where some clothing could be hung but the door could not be opened completely due to the door closer at the top of the hotel room door also the handle was very loose on the cupboard door the bed itself was too hard to sleep on
