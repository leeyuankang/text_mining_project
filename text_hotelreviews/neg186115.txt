i was very sick and could not leave the room ordered room service but it did not state a minimum order ordered an appetiser and reception said there is a minimum order i could only have liquid and was forced to order and pay for more food that i was not allowed to eat the wasted time back and forth with reception caused a late order of an extra charge that i was forced to pay reception had the cheek to say next time there are lots of other restaurants around and you do not need to order room service this whole ordeal was very unpleasant with a lack of good customer service especially for a medical emergency such as this
