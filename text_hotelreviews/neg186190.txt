it was very hot and very noisy in the rooms the airconditioning did not work for days we changed two rooms both was disappointing you ask extra towels it takes a day to get them the rooms are smaller that you expect at a start hotel too at a start hotel at that rate you expect more the staff was not very problem solving or helpful either
