the decor in the halls was really dated and out of place with tartan carpets and paintings of fox hunting everywhere the building itself is beautiful so it s a pity that the interior lets the place down it s definitely not worthy of four star status however the friendly staff location and overall value for money compensate for this and i wouldn t hesitate to recommend this hotel to a friend
