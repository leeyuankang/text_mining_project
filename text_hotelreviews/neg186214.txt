i booked two single beds but somehow they didn t get this information from booking com and we got one bed because of this our room was upgraded to superior so it s ok we were promised another room with beds but finally they forgot about it the bar was supposed to be open but of course it was closed in the morning the wifi was extremely slow especially in the evening it was impossible to work there were only two power sockets in the whole room couldn t charge my phone next to the bed there was no power socket in the bathroom to use hair curler or charge toothbrush
