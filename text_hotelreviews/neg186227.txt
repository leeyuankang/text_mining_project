the room is so tiny that i felt like in rented apartment in manhattan it was the pain in the ass even to move in the bedroom the worst thing is sound isolation there is none we lived on the floor and heard all sounds from the busy street thrue the window i have checked times if it is closed it was we had literally to buy ear plugs to sleep we have asked room cleaning personnel for another blanket they simply don t speak english not at a word this is disappointing in such hotel
