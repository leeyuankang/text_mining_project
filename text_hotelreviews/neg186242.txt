unfortunately this was a very bad experience the hotel was booked at at night on bookings com i arrived at and the receptionist said he couldn t see the booking on the computer even though i showed him the reservation and reservation number on my phone he said i can t check in for around an hour but to leave my luggage and my number and come back i did not receive a call until by which time i had made other plans the receptionist said if i don t come back now and pay he will throw my luggage on the street this in rude inconviniencing and unacceptable behaviour from any hotel acceptable behaviour would have been to simply take a deposit or the full amount and give me the room until the computer came through with the booking
