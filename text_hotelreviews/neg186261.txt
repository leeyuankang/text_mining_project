our room was clean but a bit shabby it was in a quiet part of the hotel which was good but it was very gloomy as the decor is dark and there was not much natural light there was a water leak from the room above us in the bathroom but that was fixed after reporting it it was a bit of a concern as it was dripping through a light fitting generally we thought the hotel needed a bit of tlc to be worthy of a hotel rating
