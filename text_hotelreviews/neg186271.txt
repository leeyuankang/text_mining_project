when you have two staff members in the room you should not have to ask for forks spoons cups etc and the plates dishes should be filled upas there was alway a lack of tomatoes cheese etc it would also be a good idea to have salt and pepper on each table instead of one set to be shared if you have a bar it should be open more than twice a week
