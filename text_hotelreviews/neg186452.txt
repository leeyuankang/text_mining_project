reception personnel was not very attentive and this place has an unusual policy of having to leave your room keycard with the receptionist there is nothing wrong with that just that the receptionist was not always present which had us end up in front of the hotel door unable to enter or even leave the hotel this is not convenient and even unsafe as we ended up being locked in early in the morning when we should have taken our cab
