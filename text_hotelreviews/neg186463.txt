i know the maid came in and made the bed and cleaned the bathroom but the room was never swept mopped or vacuumed not sure how you clean the floors the dust and hair was never cleaned up and there were never any extra towels in the bathroom like i requested in my reservation i also did not like the fact that the iron and ironing board had to go back every time i finished there should be one in each room and i did not like that i had to leave my room key every time i left
