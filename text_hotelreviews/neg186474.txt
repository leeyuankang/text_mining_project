i booked the hotel as a double room for my partner and i on what was supposed to be our engagement weekend when we arrived we were put in a twin room with two small single beds pushed together there was no attempt to tell us that we weren t in a double room when i went to the reception to inform them that we had been put in a twin room by mistake i was told by the lady at reception that they did not have any double rooms as apparently the toilet was broken in the double room which i was sceptical about when i asked politely if there was anything that could be done she rudely replied that s not my problem and then turned away from me i couldn t believe how rude she was i was stunned another couple overheard as they went past and told me that they had the exact same experience my suspicions that the hotel lied about the broken toilet were confirmed when i e mailed them and they replied with a different excuse that they had overbooked they added that they would compensate me with a free breakfast this is basically a scam where a hotel makes you pay for a double room knowing that they do not have one they have squeezed two uncomfortable single beds together in the hope that they will get away with it they do not care remotely about your comfort so please do not anticipate that they will do anything to make your stay more comfortable i honestly am not a demanding customer in most cicumstances and rarely make any form of complaint but feel it necessary to warn people that even though i can accept that this hotel s rooms are small not well ventilated and a little uncomfortable but they do not provide rooms to the specificity they claim and are incredibly rude with little to no customer service there are vastly better options all around paris do not trust this hotel as more reviews become available at this relatively new hotel you will discover that this is far from a legitimate and respectable four star hotel
