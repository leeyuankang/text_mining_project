i travelled light so managed to leave the card i had booked our room on at home when i realised i presumed it would be fine seeing as the hotel had already taken the money months earlier at check in the hotel said they needed the card i explained i didn t have it but they kept saying they couldn t do anything without it i explained that i couldn t spend hours travelling home to get it they said all they could do would be to refund the original money and i d have to pay again i explained that i didn t have in my account to pay again so wouldn t be able to do so until the refund had cleared and i could therefore transfer it over they said they just needed the card to take a payment of and then would refund it i then remembered i had the card on my phone via apple pay they explained this wouldn t be possible as they don t have contactless card machines at this point we were at a stalemate she went to speak to the manager who said there was nothing they could do and these were the rules i then asked to speak to the manager directly when he came out i explained i could prove the card was mine and could also pay the penny on it via apple pay plus queried why it mattered when they had already taken the money therefore i couldn t exactly do a runner he said it had to be that card but then said he would take payment at the bar on the contactless machine there so after minutes of back and forth and him saying via the first receptionist that he couldn t do anything it was resolved in seconds of speaking to him i completely understand the rules are in place for fraud protection and am pleased they take it seriously but i didn t expect a modern hotel to tell me that they can t take my payment as they don t have a contactless machine despite having them foot away behind the bar
