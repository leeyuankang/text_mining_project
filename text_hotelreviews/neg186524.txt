i bought this trip for my son he was asked for a deposit which he had no problem paying in cash as he s years old and does not have credit cards they wouldn t except his cash and where not going to let him stay he had to phone me in spain and luckily i had the card with me basically this was his first trip for him and his girlfriend to london and they felt frightened as they didn t think they could stay as it took awhile to contact me so no i wouldn t recommend this hotel
