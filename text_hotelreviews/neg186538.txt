their seemed to be a lack of communication between staff on arrival i stated that my mother had made the payment so therefore i did not have the card on me the receptionist then stated i had to ask my mother to email her card details with a picture copy of her bank card which we did after a delay of over minutes i finally was able to check in two days later on check out a new receptionist then informed that i needed the original card my mothers to complete the check out i once again explained this was not my card i then had to make the full payment on my personal card the original payment had to be refunded to my mothers card it seemed unnecessary hassle and it added stress to my stay i felt this could have been communicated to me on check in
