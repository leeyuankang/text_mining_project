the receptionist telling me my credit card had been blocked when she tried charging the pound deposit they ask for at check in and when i phoned my bank after check out they tell me it was not blocked at all and was failure of the hotel s terminal also being woken up by cleaning crew knocking at am and then again later on near when i had paid pounds for late check out at not blaming cleaning person hotel must inform them better about check outs an extremely loud alarm i couldn t locate origin of only seconds at time while finishing getting ready to leave contributed to my feeling of being a bit chased out of there not huge issues but not things i reasonably expect from a not cheap star hotel
