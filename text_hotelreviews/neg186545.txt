location is not great lots of homeless people outside the hotel at night long wait to check in out reception staff were appalling it took over mins to check in not because of a long que but because every single person had an issue with checking in it started with them wanting to take off a card for security not a problem but then it had to be the same card you booked with the room was pre paid with a different card then that had to be cancelled it just went on and on check out was a long wait because there was a large que and once again customers having problems they need to look in to an express check in out system
