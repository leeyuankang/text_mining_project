i have stayed here before and thought rooms were clean bed comfortable perfectly acceptable and reasonable value for london hotel on this occasion i was given a poor room that was sometimes noisy the main problem was the beds two single beds that were spongy and felt like a camp bed to sleep on shower head also would not adjust hopefully this was a one off
