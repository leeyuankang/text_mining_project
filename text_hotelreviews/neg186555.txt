well we were there for the gigs which starts at nearby we arrived at the hotel at and were told to come back to check in at so we left our bags there and went to the gig only to be told that we can t come out of the gig and return so we have to go back to the hotel at our expense and explain to the reception staff that there no way we could check in at the staff kindly look at this and checks us in at their discretion i know it s the hotel policy for travellers to check in at but sometimes it s not possible we wasted some money on the taxi to and back to the gig again
