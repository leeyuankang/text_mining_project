the staff were extremely rude i did not have the card that i booked the room with due to cancelling it they demanded the full amount to be paid again and they would refund the amount already paid to a no longer exisitng credit card when i explained that this was simply not possible the manager said do you want this room or not in an extremely aggressive manner i had already paid for the room and was willing to pay the damage deposit on another card but his customer service skills left a lot to be desired i would not recommend staying here simply due to the rude nature of the staff
