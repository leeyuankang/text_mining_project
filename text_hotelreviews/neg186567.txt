the staff in the restaurant were appalling on arriving for breakfast we were told that we hadn t pre booked which i was aware of we were then asked for the little card sleeve that the roomy was in as proof of signature i explained that i d thrown the sleeve in the bin but was more than happy to just pay for breakfast upfront if necessary at which pint i was basically told no signature no breakfast shocking customer service to the point were i will not return or recommend this place
