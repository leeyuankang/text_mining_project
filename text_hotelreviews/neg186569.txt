i ll be honest and say we booked for a weekend of socialising and a night out so did not really care for the small and slow tv but if we had spent more time in the room would have been really frustrated with it as we were checking out we quickly glanced over at one of the executive rooms as i was glad we did not take the option to upgrade as the facilities were pretty much the same with the only obvious benefit being a slightly larger room and a seating area at almost more than the price of a standard room i did not feel it offered the value for money i would be prepared to upgrade for we also opted against the breakfast at per person i did not see what was on offer but would expect a high quality and fresh choice at the price
