the room was very dark it actually made it hard to read and smelled funny the wifi is very weak and keeps dropping the shower curtain kept gluing to my body while showering so i had to put it outside of the bath tube which meant a swimming pool outside the bathtub every time i finished shower the location is ok but that s not shoreditch at all i was on a business trip so didn t care much about the overall thing but if i had gone on a romantic trip i would be well upset
