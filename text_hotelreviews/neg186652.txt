this hotel would not let us check in because the night s stay was paid for by someone else who was not present and the paying debit card was not with the persons staying on the night unless a separate card was proffered and despite the fact that the night had been paid for a further payment was demanded staff are surly unfriendly and unaccommodating will not stay again
