we arrived after midnight after a show in hoxton and were told that again there was no disabled car parking available and no standard spaces either the hotel policy is they won t allow guests to pre book their a night parking so it s pot luck if you can park when you arrive how ludicrous the receptionist was very kind and said he would find us a space when we entered the secure car park there were at least twenty empty spaces unexplainable so we went to the bar that is open til to get a coffee and we re told the coffee machine was turned off even though the bar was open for another minutes disappointed we had two double rooms booked and paid for for my wife and i and also our friends our room was freezing cold when we opened the door i turned the heating on full and temperature set to degrees after an hour of freezing cold air blowing round the room we decided to turn it off by this time it was and i thought it no point telling reception as we didn t fancy having maintenance men in our room so early in the morning we were tired and just went to bed for a few hours fully clothed after trying to warm up with the hairdryer we could t sleep properly and we re glad when morning came so we could leave the room i am a disabled man with a chest condition and have now picked up a cold from the freezing inhabitable conditions in the room i told reception in the morning and they said i should have told maintenance at and that was the end of it also when we checked out we noticed there was hardly a car in the car park so why pretend the car park was full to capacity at in the morning thoroughly disappointed after our fifth or sixth stay at the re hotel we won t be staying again they re just not bothered with having happy customers so they won t be having any more of our money avoid like the plague unless you like a challenge
