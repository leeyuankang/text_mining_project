disappointment when sitting in the foyer area of the hotel as to the amount of homeless people coming into the hotel and begging guest for money or cigarettes these same people at times were intoxicated and used the lounge area to sleep as a paying guest this is not the idea of a chilling time i had in mind this was our visit to the re and we have always enjoyed our time however the above incidents in the lounge area was most unwelcome a suggestion is that a better system is put into place to ensure that members of the public who enter off the streets are there to use the facilities i e the bar area not just to go to the toilet maybe a security guard could be employed i work with the homeless so have much sympathy but as a paying guess i don t think it is right that i should have people coming into the re asking for money etc
