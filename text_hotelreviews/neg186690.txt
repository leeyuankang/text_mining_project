the bed was super average could feel the odd spring also the occasional stain on sheets pillow cases tv remote was dead my phone was faster than the free wifi had requested quiet room when booking due to early starts but was was given ground floor room right next to reception lots of noise outside heels walking on solid floor elevator doors alarms colleagues talking etc wasn t ideal for the price paid it was a very average stay i m afraid to say i m sure this might be a one off event but it s put me off staying here again
