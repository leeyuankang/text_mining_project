avoid at all costs strange rules and behaviors i ve never seen anywhere and i ve been to a lot of places i d have to spend too much time typing how awful my experience in this was and why i won t bore you too much though i ll just say that the little untrustworthy rude manager who took care of my check in late at night was awful beyond belief felt like a dark comedy of some sort really she even suggested at one point that i should giver her pounds in cash even though i payed for the room beforehand because i used my fathers card to pay online i had to call him at a m woke him up he had to turn on his laptop print some kind of sheet and fill it with personal details scan it back to the laptop send picturres of his credit card and number and sign everything or i d be sleeping in the streets with my room already paid for this was the tip of the iceberg that was my awful experience ps this is in hackney not shoreditch i don t know why they re ashamed of their location and then allow shady staff like that to manage anything plus the local drunks in the bar in the same counter as the reception loudly making fun of customers along with the staff wasn t very pleasant
