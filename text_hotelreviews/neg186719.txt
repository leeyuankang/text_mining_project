i didn t like the fact that our power wasn t working for one morning and when i called reception they said they would send the manager up to check it out we waited half an hour and the manager never showed up then we called reception again and they said they would send the maintainer guy but then all of sudden the power came back on i didn t like the fact that i had to even fuss about the power first of all and that they took so long to help us out with it the carpet also smelled funny i think that they should spend some time washing it because it gave off a weird smell also the sink doesn t seem to drain the water properly because it would take a couple of minutes to drain the water which got annoying
