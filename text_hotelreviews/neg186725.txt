the room service was terrible i ordered a hugely overpriced tuna toasted sandwich and which was dry and almost inedible and a bowl of chips which were undercooked but i was starving after a long day and had already waited minutes for it to be delivered would have been better off visiting one of the great turkish restaurants nearby
