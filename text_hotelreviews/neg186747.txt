the size of the room small the positioning of the tv and it was old fashioned and we were not able to adjust the position so had to always watch from the bed or had to move a heavy chair to near the wardrobe the shower head was angled straight ahead towards the back wall therefore hitting you in the face at times if not careful also the bath very small my wife is only and had to bend her legs so very uncomfortable to bathe in the dinner menu choice very limited and food tasteless the gammon was tough no offer to replace or refund inedible lighting in room too bright with all the spotlights no choice other than the infrared bedside lights which were inadequate for reading or even to light the room
