some of the staff were pretty cold with us one time we ask the receptionist to print off pdf from a pendrive it was a ticket confirmation but they refused im working in a same star rated hotel actually in the reception area and in my place we do this couple of time every week for free just to help our guests guy in bar on mornings was pretty busy was pretty bad experience to realize that to park your car in the car park costs pound per night
