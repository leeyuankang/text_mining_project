staff charged me a deposit of on arrival but were vague about why and when i would receive it back saying it was down to my bank to release it i was not at all happy about this as i ve never been charged extra prior to a hotel stay before i m a very tidy and conscientious person so i expect them to refund it but it annoyed me as i hadn t budgeted for it and may have now gone overdrawn
