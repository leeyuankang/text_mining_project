the bath only had a shower on the ceiling without a cable to use the bar was exactly next to the reception thus the main reception smells beer and gives bad first impression the hotel charges for guarantee and the amount is given back to you at the checkout first time i saw that but the receptionist said it s common the outfit and the look of the receptionist not very good breakfast not included in the price overall not very nice hotel for this price
