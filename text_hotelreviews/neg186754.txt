we are coming to this hotel since many years and it has changed owners in the beginning we were welcomed at check in and felt welcome now we have the feeling when we check in that we are just allowed in subject to pre authorizing the full amount for our stay over pounds plus gbp for extra s what extra s the minibar is empty i travel around the world for over years and stay in a lot of hotels so i know this is not common practice i am afraid the love is gone
