majority of staff were polite and courteous but too many were borderline rude particularly in the bar dining area and all fell short of being warm notable exception was the lady on reception who was polite efficient and friendly restaurant food was very poor fish and chips looked great on the plate the tartare sauce and the peas real crushed peas were the highlights but the fish and the chips were totally tasteless and the batter was practically soggy only managing to be crisp at the very ends peas aside the meal could have been absolutely anything in a blind test it didn t help that the maitre d was too busy chatting to a lady friend and i had to interrupt him to get a seat then his friend stood right in the way blocking the entrance to the dining area also didn t help that two tvs in the lounge bar restaurant area were playing download charts the volume was low scantily clad pop artists are fine but not while i m eating my dinner please and definitely not a place to eat with young children breakfast the next morning was fine but again fine but spoiled by staff who showed almost no manners and made you feel you were in their way will not be returning
