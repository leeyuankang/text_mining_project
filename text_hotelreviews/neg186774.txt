furniture in bar looking a bit tired and felt a bit like an airport departure lounge as it s right inside the main doors and so people are constantly coming and going so it doesn t feel very relaxing but i guess that s the only area it could be given the size of the room and the fact that the restaurant is directly in front of the bar so small niggle really everywhere very clean though always a plus point and like i said earlier staff very friendly and even opened the bar up again for some members of our party which was lovely
