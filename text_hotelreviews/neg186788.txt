expensive for what it is holiday inn express would have been better no breakfast included dirty plates were left outside rooms for over hours the tv was small cheap and so far away from the bed that it was hard to watch the bath was so small that you couldn t lie in it properly i called ahead before we booked in and the receptionist didn t speak english the queues for check out were annoying
