if the bed had been comfortable would never hesitate to stay again at this hotel but the bed was not comfortable and the staff did let me try another bed in another room but it was the same and i spoke to many people who had either stayed or were still staying there and not one of them said the beds were comfortable but because their stay was only short they were not concerned but considering my stay was for nights and have back problems there was no quality sleep and this was very disturbing if quality mattresses were on the beds am sure your business would be even in more demand to stay at your hotel and i would always stay there with a great comfortable mattress quality costs but not where business is concerned that needs to be a no priority as so much more is going for your hotel my son and myself ate dinner there one night but one of his prawns was not cooked properly and we did report that but the staff person didn t seem to be concerned luckily my son picked up on that otherwise he could possibly of had food poisoning so therefore due to the staff person not having done anything about that we did not eat there again but saying all this re the mattress if really comfortable would stay without a hesitation and thank you to all the good staff who were wonderful and efficient and love their smiles and friendliness
