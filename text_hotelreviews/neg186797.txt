the booking in and payment systems are a bit cumbersome but nothing to worry about i would have given the hotel a top rating had it not been for the manager i was sitting in the lounge when he emerged from his office and started shouting abuse at the reception staff at the top of his voice in front of his customers he appeared generally ill natured and was also abrupt with the bar staff the owners could do better by replacing him
