you have to leave a deposit when checking in not explained when booking that doesn t go back into your account until working days after you leave i was not happy about this as it was over the holiday period so had the option to leave in cash after a lot of hesitation i don t think a deposit is necessary when you have already paid for the room and the staff member on reception was rude and less than helpful
