firstly the hotel is located in bethnal green so is falsely advertised as london shoreditch the main reason we stayed at this hotel was because it was advertised as shoreditch if we knew it was a minute cab journey or minute walk we would have never stayed there also when checked in we were given a room next door to a room that had building work going on which was loud and something we definitely did not want to hear
