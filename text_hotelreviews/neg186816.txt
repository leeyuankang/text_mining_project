when i tried to order room service and i was told the kitchen was closed although i ordered within the advertised time frame it is not might fault if you are having a slow night if you advertise the kitchen to be open for a certain time frame you should stay open for your guests i would have accepted a limited menu instead of a blanket no and the staff member hanging up on me i am months pregnant and really was in need of food appalling service from the guy who answered the phone
