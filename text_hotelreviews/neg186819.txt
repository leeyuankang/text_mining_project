front desk staff weren t very responsive happy and lacked knowledge of the local area didn t take the initiative to call us when the taxi arrived so we nearly missed our friend s wedding ceremony there must have been a bubble in the water pipes as there was a vibration note that kept coming and going in the morning staff didn t seem to appreciate that this disturbed our sleep when we informed them i contacted in advance for early check in but they tried to play dumb when i arrived and also tried to charge me more than agreed by email clearly the room wasn t ready but they faffed about instead of being honest with me
