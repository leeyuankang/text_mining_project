the running water was off for my whole stay and that meant i didn t shower clean my teeth or flush the toilet for over hrs when asked at the desk when it would be back on i kept getting the same answer and that answer was in one hours time i stayed and paid for a late check out so i could make sure i could shower and it still wasn t on when i left i was also not offered any compensation on my check out for the water and the whole experience was disappointing and handled poorly
