the staff always looked extremely stressed and were actually quite rude on one occasion we asked could they help us print some pages for sightseeing vouchers as there are no self printing facilities we were informed there was a charge per page which was compleltey fine by us this request was met by what i can only describe as distain the lady was so rude and dismissive we just left the immediate local area is quite run down i wouldn t recommend walking alone at night
