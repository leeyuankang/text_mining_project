couldn t enjoy evening meal there was a lot of chili in the squid starter no chili mentioned on menu my wife has an allergic reaction to chili and i thought the chili overpowered the dish anyway staff were pleasant when we complained but it seems there was no more squid left to cook we were given the option of swapping our starter or having a dessert we chose a dessert which turned out to be unpleasant too please list all ingredients in the dishes on restaurant menu as like us there are people with certain specific food allergies
