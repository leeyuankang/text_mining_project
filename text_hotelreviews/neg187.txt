the hotel is being renovated and an extensive development is unfolding just outside during working hours the noise can be very disturbing the facilities look and sound rickety the a c is extremely loud and not very effective overall the room was too cold what s worse turning it off makes it possible to hear water flowing dropping through pipes in the walls chinese water torture anyone the bathroom walls are transparent and i don t mean you can maybe make something out if you squint i mean oh my word i didn t want to see that there is maybe one spot in the room where one does not have a complete view of whatever is happening inside the bathroom the staff didn t change the towels they simply re folded them days in a row with no new towels the hotel is quite far from the center and there s little to do around it if you think you can walk think again and take the tram instead or another hotel
