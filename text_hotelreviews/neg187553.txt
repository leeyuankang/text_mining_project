the room was stuffy the window was high on the wall above eye level the bathroom had broken tiles on the floor there were two weddings taking place and despite being advised that the central courtyard would be vacated by at the latest we continued to be disturbed by guests congregating beneath our window until well past midnight in addition we were also disturbed by people clearing up after the functions both at night and again from early in the morning our air conditioning made a terrible racket so we were unable to close our windows permanently basically we were unable to get to sleep after a very busy day which left us feeling exhausted regrettably this is the second occasion this has happened to us the staff are always very helpful at the hotel but losing a nights sleep on our last two visits there has basically ruined what should have been a relaxing and enjoyable trip
