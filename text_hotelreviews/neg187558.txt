the air con in the room didn t work had to use fans for days which was quite uncomfortable with it being outside no one seemed to take action to fix it but once addressed with manager at check out he compensated us and was extremely apologetic and disappointed that the issue hadn t been addressed during our stay but we felt satisfied to return to the hotel again after speaking to the manager i would return to the hotel and it s a good location
