with a major rugby match being televised during our stay we had chosen the hotel partly for its sky sport channels unfortunately that channel didn t work on the day the reception suggested it was a network wide problem but we really didn t buy that explanation and think their it team could have done a little more to investigate urgently a few minutes interference would have been explained easily but hours of video with seriously impaired audio seems unlikely to us i guess you can t please all the people all the time though
