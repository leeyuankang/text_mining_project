no terrace on the roof and very long corridors because of the old building but in the same time the good quality of rooms it was value for money and located in a good place that s why it was my choice but night i stayed in their second hotel which advise me in a hotel due to no availability for the first night lond city houses located nearby and had a little bit more quality there and good terrace on the roof for breakfast and nice city view so i can advise both of this hotels to stay
