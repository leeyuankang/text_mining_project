my stay was a gift from my mother she booked using her credit card but on the day i saw the small print on the booking saying you needed to bring the card it was booked on i called the hotel to ask what to do the man i spoke to was very unhelpful he spent a long time explaining that i needed to fill in a form and get my mother to fill one in as well only to say that had to be done hours before the booking and therefore i couldn t do that my mother also called and received similarly unhelpful service thankfully on arrival the lady who checked us in was a lot more helpful and accommodating
