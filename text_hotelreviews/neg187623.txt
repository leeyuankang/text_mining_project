the room wasn t as clean as one would expect from a hotel of this standing there was a coke bottle lid on the floor behind the curtains when i arrived and when getting into bed i found hairs on the pillow not enough to leave but not what i expect from this hotel chain also i used the soap and they didn t replace it the next day just put the empty bottle in the correct place really i pointed these things out and received an sorry but it was empty and delivered with little effort or conviction i ve stayed in the other hotel in finsbury circus several time and always much better so very disappointing
