i traveled so many countries with star hotel but i never seen that kind of bad service hotel you can find more reasonable good quality hotels instead of this hotel metro station is only min distance but usually weekend is out of working room was tiny and noisy we complained about that and they changed the room with more noisy and double bed we are two women and our room was twin and urine smell eventhough i spent all my parfum but that smell was continued so we had to come back to our previous room one reception guy helped us only for one luggage peevishly unkindly we had luggage also when i realized i forgot my shoes in the room i called to hotel for checking day later they said no shoes in the room eventhough certainly i put my shoes in our room i totally can say that reception especially in charge of luggage is unkind and house keeping is quite suspisious i definitely do not recommend this hotel
