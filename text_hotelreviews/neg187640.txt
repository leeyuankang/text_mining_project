we paid our deposit at the begininning of the stay and paid in cash which we were fine with as we knew we were getting it back when it came to checking out the staff on reception had no recollection of the deposit so then we had to wait for a manager who had to check the cctv which took a while before giving us it back also whilst i was checking out another member of staff got us a taxi which my partner was sat in but didn t end up going anywhere because of the situation so we had to pay for the taxi which didn t go anywhere
