hotel environment great but very sad to say that food let this hotel down for me paid for full english breakfast but only continental on offer in the club lounge continental breakfast extremely poor for a star hotel i ve had better breakfasts in a star only meats some smoked salmon varieties of sliced cheese some cereals bowl of greek yogurt toast and varieties of pastries offered on arrival to breakfast there were no clean plates and we had to ask for them to replenish food bring butter to table etc breakfast room busy with only one staff member who appeared put out every time you asked for something when really to give star service there should have been another waiting staff jugged hair pub food pricey and very average
