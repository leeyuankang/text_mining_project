this is just personal but for me the mattress was too soft and i was considering sleeping on the floor another downfall was that despite having a superior room we received a room with connecting doors and could hear everything going on in the next room having a window facing the courtyard with an entrance to the brewery wasn t ideal due to noises late at night but hey that wasn t as loud as next door occupants our tv was defect as well however we received a complimentary breakfast which was nice as it was free however if you are not eating pork in form of cold cuts you are limited for choice which doesn t justify per person
