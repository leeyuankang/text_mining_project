i was looking for the london suites not montcalm nothing in my booking information mention montcalm so it took a while to know where we were going very frustrating the breakfast was average i had the eggs royale muffins were not toasted the bacon was very salty the cumberland sausages were pasty and floury in texture quite disgusting to be honest then as i sat there i saw a mouse having a great time on the floor in the bottom end of the restaurant where i was sitting
