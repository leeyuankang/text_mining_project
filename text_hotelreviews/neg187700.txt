access we had a to og over a large courtyard to initially get to the room from reception normal access to the room was through the pub we were offered breakfast when we checked in at per person instead of the advertised but we rejected both offers as being exorbitantly priced so did not try the food at all in nights reasonably priced restaurant just over the road serving excellent food not breakfast though
