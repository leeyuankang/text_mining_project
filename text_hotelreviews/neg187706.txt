we were staying in the south wing which i m really not sure is part of city suites or the brewery the room was a bit of a trek from reception but we were shown in detail where to go the room was fairly small and faced onto the back of another building there was no noise from outside or from other rooms which was good apart from some kind of generator which meant we couldn t keep the window open on check in we were told we had been upgraded to a club room however there didn t seem to be any difference between our room and the standard rooms and we certainly were not informed that any benefits came with the upgrade my major criticism however would be the length of the bed my partner is only and his feet were dangling over the edge so it would be a nightmare for anyone taller
