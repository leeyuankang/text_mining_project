upon check in i asked for a quiet room not overlooking street side the reception staff member did his best to find the quiet room i only checked into my room in the late evening to discover that it had a tiny window facing a huge wall and very annoying noise from the ventilation system despite earplugs sleeping pills and a pillow over my head i was not able to sleep all night what a nightmare
