my room was on the ground floor right by the outside seating area so it makes sense to have locked windows but i couldn t get the curtains to open either which made it a little dark didn t matter much as i was out all day but for my next stay and i will definitely come back i will ask for a room on an upper floor also the fact that the fire door was unlocked all day made me a little uncomfortable but all in all this was a brilliant find and i would definitely recommend
