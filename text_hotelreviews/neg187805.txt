the lift was not working in our wing therefore we were told by the young lady receptionist that we would be getting an upgrade on the fourth floor when i checked my booking it was the same type of room the superior double room dark no daylight due to building right next to us and rather small lots of stairs in a maze good try the concierge guy romanian origin very nice man with excellent english ran down and arranged a real update for us the club room was great spacious enough facing onto the street with real light and fresh air
