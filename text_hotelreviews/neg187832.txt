someone left the alarm clock on for which was quite stressful after we had been to a work event and didn t get in until late also the television wouldn t turn off when we used the remote control and when we tried to turn it off from the unit so we had to leave it on while we were sleeping which was quite off putting because it the brightness kept waking us up
