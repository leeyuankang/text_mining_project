we checked in late after a long flight but we re not given a room in the london city suits building but in the brewery side of the montcalm opposite this is not good at anytime with luggage given the layout of the hotel where lots of stairs cannot be avoided then to get into a room with a large open window to the bathroom without a functioning blind we had to be moved to another wing of the hotel it was late and involved even more stairs before getting to our room which was still not on the side of the hotel originally booked the morning was even worse with an early start heavy suitcases to drag up and down stairs as you couldn t take lifts all of which was before even continental breakfast was available in the restaurant annoyingly for me this was a generally poor experience and not star as advertised
