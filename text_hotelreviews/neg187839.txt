i was disappointed in the breakfast which i thought was very expensive compared to other hotels on booking com yet it was nothing special at all tea was poured for you out of a pot carried about by the serving staff when then appeared you didn t get your own pot breakfast was also in a pub a few metres down the road so it felt a bit disjointed beware of the tube disruptions on a sunday and check your route the barbican station was shut
