one of the worst experiences i ever had it s an apartment at few minutes walk from the main hotel the receptionist gave us the wrong key and we had to call several time and finally walk back ourselves twice before they found out the error they didn t even apologise for that they ended up totally ruining our evening there weren t enough towels in the room and they didn t offer to bring any we had to walk back to the reception the following day to get them the wifi wasn t working fortunately now europe is free roaming the last day we had to leave early so we asked the receptionist if we could leave the keys inside she told us yes so we did few days later i was charged for late check out i called them and explained the situation they promised a reimbourse which of course never came
