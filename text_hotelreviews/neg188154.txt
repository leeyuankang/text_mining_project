this hotel had every bad wifi problem it was unsecured yet also required a crazy long form to be filled out before you were granted access it was super weak and also disconnected you every few hours the air conditioning was very weak and quiet which sucks if you like it as background noise also if there were minibars in the room this hotel would really be improved there is a little wine bar downstairs but they were completely out of white wine
