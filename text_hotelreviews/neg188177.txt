the wifi in our room was intermittent had many problems keeping a stable connection during our nights stay and we were asked to connect to other rooms wifi instead the room was extremely small we almost couldn t open our luggage they should just do away with the wardrobe table and chair which wasted space in that small room the toilet sink bath area has no door if you re conscious about that please do not book this room not sure about other rooms in this hotel i was staying with my sister and the open concept did feel awkward
