the air conditioning was barely working they told me that paris never experiences outdoor temperatures like those which is a total lie the motor was simply inadequate opening the window to get some fresh air from the outside instead was impossible because of the people on the street and in the bars enjoying themselves there are no ironing facilities in the room i went downstairs to get an iron and the guy had to run across the street to get one the rooms are small i was on the top floor and even if i m only i could barely fit my head under the shower paying all that money and having so little comfort is unacceptable
