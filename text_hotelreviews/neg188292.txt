the price was high but the hotel was of good quality the room was not cleaned when we approached the staff without making a fuss we asked for just clean towels it did not matter about the room that was not done neither we paid so therefore we would have expected this do have been done when we told reception about it the next morning i would have expected a small discount as it was a lot of money for nothing
