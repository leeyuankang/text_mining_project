very bad air con so room got very hot couldn t open balcony door as on a very noisy road which we knew as we wanted to be near wembley stadium so we did not get much sleep the breakfast was terrible see our photos of what was supposed to be scrambled egg broccoli for breakfast with lemon the fact that the room was x that of its normal cost because we went to a concert at wembley should make the hotel even more determined to give great service and food don t stay there if you want to sleep in a cool room and have a decent breakfast
