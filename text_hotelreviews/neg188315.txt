i didn t like the fact a hot buffet breakfast or cook to order wasn t included in the price of the stay staff were very stiff and wooden at breakfast time there was no offer to get us drinks offer us a menu or even make us feel welcome not good when you pay per night the room service cut off was rediculous and there was no way you d get anything after the cut of time not good when you return mins after there cut of point i am due to stay here in december again for a gig and theprice is quid so i may well cancel as i wasn t impressed by the food situation
