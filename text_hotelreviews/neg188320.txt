the staff are not professionally trained as a staff opened my room without knocking in the very early morning the facility looks new however the door in my room was too rusted to open so i was locked and could not open the door inside the room fortunately got help from the staff in the end the towels are not clean as they were badly stained not sure if they changed it from previous occupants the aircon produced hot air not cold and it was noisy all night through probably the worst experience i ve ever had stay away from this hotel
