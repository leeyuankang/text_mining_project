regina restaurant where you have breakfast and can have italian food isn t really seperated and is open plan to the foyer breakfast is served here continental which was included was adequate we upgraded to a full english which was absolutely awful and i left mine hard fried eggs beans in a seperated bowl but was swimming in grease bad quality sausages and bacon but the restaurant is good value both food and drinks considering your in london and the busyness reflected this we booked the restaurant for an evening meal prior to arriving based on the website thinking it was abit special but was badly let down again good value and ok food but i wanted it to be a special meal for my husband and myself
