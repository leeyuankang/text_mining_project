misleading info regarding breakfast booking form said full english breakfast is available at but we had to pay for continental and were told we would have had to pay an additional for full english despite the clear breaking of the trade descriptions act we were not offered any reduction we re also disappointed that e mails to the hotel prior to our stay relating to an earlier cancelled booking remain unanswered
