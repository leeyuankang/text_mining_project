sadly we had no hot water on the first morning we rang reception and reported it we had to go out without a shower we were told it was fixed when we got back to find that it wasnt when we complained we were moved to another room we complained on departure and we were told the manager wasnt in but that she would contact us shortly after our stay we are still waiting so disappointing if it hadn t have been for this our rating would be top marks it s not the problem it s how it s dealt with
