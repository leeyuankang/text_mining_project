we had some trouble with the electronic key card to access the room we had to get the card scanned about times to try to get it to work in the end they gave us the manual key to use i realise this isn t a huge negative but when you d driven hours to get there it s not ideal having to go back and fourth to the desk the staff were very helpful though also the room smelled of smoke when we walked in despite it being a no smoking room
