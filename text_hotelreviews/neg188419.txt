extremely small room with a view of dingy back gardens of neighbouring houses and the car park through a wide window at plus for parking it was expensive breakfast costs extra food in restaurant was just ok had to wait a long time for a pizza and when it arrived didn t have the chilli that i requested and was basically just a hard flatbread pizza with a few vegetables scattered haphazardly on top leaving a lot of the pizza as just plain cheese
