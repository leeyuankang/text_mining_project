the bed was beds pushed together you would expect a proper double bed in a luxury hotel although the first member of staff was friendly she messed up our room booking overcharged us and said we had breakfast when we didn t the next day the male receptionist was very rude said it was our mistake which it wasn t we had rung the night before and been told check out was he rang at half and told us check out was i explained we had been told and he said well it s no apologies for any of there mistakes the actual room was very nice although i don t think it was upgraded as we were told but i feel the mistakes made ruined it
