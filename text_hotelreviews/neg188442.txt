apart from the fact that the prices were double the usual rate due to it being a match day the air con didn t work the remote for the bathroom tv didn t work the safe was already locked on arrival and there was no ironing board i didn t have time to complain as i had a football match to rush off to however when i politely reported this at checkout the guy at reception was unsympathetic and didn t offer an apology just said casually that he would mention it to his superior if i wasn t running late for work i probably would have put him straight still very unprofessional and rude on his part which unfortunately reflects badly on the hotel
