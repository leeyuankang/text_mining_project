the staff was the most disappointing part of the trip they could have been friendlier and more helpful so if you don t plan on having any issues go ahead and stay here however when soothing does come up get ready to wait around for about an hour while someone finds a solution we had about three issues one at check in that took the longest by the third i did not care anymore and just wanted checkout and watch to ensure there was no extra charges on my account because i would dispute them there was none but still kept that eye out
