hotel have a bizarre policy about swiping same card room was booked and prepaid with i did not bring that card with me but could produce id to prove it was mine but very inflexible and i had to have that card refunded and pay again with another card so i am still waiting for my refund to hit my account which means currently i have paid double for my room hotel ignored my email about it being my boyfriend s birthday the next day and then when they found out told me infront of him i should ve let them know and even once they found out they still did nothing about it rooms looked empty only one chair at the desk even when there are two of you and nothing else to sit on apart from a bed very inconvinient
