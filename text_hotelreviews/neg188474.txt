there is limited parking on site and they charge per night sadly our last night we were locked out of our room as the card system had failed and the receptionist had no idea what to do other than offer us an alternate room to sleep in for the night all our luggage and belongings were stuck in our original room so this was extremely inconvenient and frustrating we have since emailed through our complaint and called up and yet had no correspondence from the hotel manager terrible customer service and not what you would expect from a new business considering the price that we paid
