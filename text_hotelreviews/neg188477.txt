at the time of booking we did include the time of our arrival for we arrived shortly after and was told our room wasnt ready which wasnt ideal as we had a short break and the hotel itself is located outside london abt half an hr fortunately we ate lunch in the hotel resturant and the room was ready when we were finished so we could check in then
