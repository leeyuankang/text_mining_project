the hair dryer supplied was wired in a drawer and would not reach enough to see myself in the mirror made drying my hair a nightmare and the hotel really do not to address this also breakfast was very unorganised and we had to ask for numerous things ie coffee glasses and bread etc they also bought out breakfast and did not tell us beforehand that they had run out of some items also over priced at as this does not include cereals or fruit the hotel seemed very short staffed at times
