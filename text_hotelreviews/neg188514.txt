curtain not blackout not good in summer unless you bring eye shades also some basic amenities missing that one would expect from a star hotel e g face tissues as a minimum no ironing board in room asked for it personally at reception but it never turned up coffee at breakfast awful and bitter breakfast ends too early at am check out time too early at am annoying the standard in most hotels is noon all of the above didn t bother us too much as we were there for only one night but would be irritating on longer stays providing feedback mainly to allow this new hotel to improve on these deficiencies
