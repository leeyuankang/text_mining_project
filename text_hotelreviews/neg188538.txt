poor welcome at reception and given wrong room key so had to return from the floor to get replacement heating sensor in room broken so arrival temperature was degrees reported it no action taken tea and coffee facilities not topped up most solid and uncomfortable pillows i ve ever had generally felt that hotel was trying to be a boutique hotel but failed just seemed as if nothing quite worked and staff certainly weren t at a level that one would expect for that cost compared to other wembley hotels massively overpriced
