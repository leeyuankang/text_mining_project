although check in was at we arrived for as our event started at at the wembley stadium we would have liked to freshen up first after a hour drive there was no room available for this and no rooms would be given till as i was told previous guests had only left at noon check out the next day was but a maid entered our room at to clean it when we left the room there were at least or maids cleaning the other rooms so surely there was a possibility that some rooms were ready earlier than other hotels in the area have accommodated us in previous years earlier than the quoted check in time in the knowledge that the event at wembley was taking place
