staff were a little curt but very helpful there is a hidden charge on arrival for a safety deposit which is i think on a card or cash i don t feel that this was made apparent when booking and there were three other people who were equally as surprised as me this needs addressing additionally my card had failed when they had tried to take payment prior to my arrival this was intentional on my part as i had tried to pay the day before with a different card over the phone and was told i couldn t as there was already a pre authorized card on my account so i decided to pay cash on arrival i explained all of this to the concierge who informed me that when your card fails they don t hold your reservation and that you can in fact pay over the phone actually and that he would try his best to fit me in if they happened to have a room i felt that his tone was more in the realm of telling me off rather than apologizing and trying to find out who had misinformed me and why luckily they had a room because if they hadn t i would have been absolutely livid i don t believe your guests should be made to feel like naughty children because of the hotels lack of communication and knowledge of their own policies that being said apart from this incident they could not have been more attentive and helpful
