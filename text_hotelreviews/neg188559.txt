in our opinion this is not a five star hotel this was the most expensive room we had stayed in on several visits to london and was not worth the money we paid no toilet rolls in our bathroom when we arrived so we had to request some from reception the lady who brought the t rolls to our room was rather rude and needed to see the empty toilet roll holder before she gave us one no apology was given from her the room was very small and the twin beds were not particularly comfortable with quilts that just about covered your torso we are ladies size and so i pity any male occupants towels toiletries were not star high quality only two english breakfast tea bags left in the room and no hot chocolate sachets lots of uht milk cartons left in the fridge why and one of the two milk cartons we opened was off so we had just one cup of tea the milk cartons should be checked and changed on a daily basis the cost of the room was maybe due to the extra television in the bathroom a facility which we did not use and we considered this addition unnecessary in this type of room standard in our opinion it is obvious that you pay a higher price for a room when there is an event at wembley but this was not worth the extra cost the next time we will choose a central london hotel and travel to wembley
