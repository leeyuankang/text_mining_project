normal hotel happy hour for a cheap drink is between this was no the case when i was at the hotel the excuse given was they do not have this offer on when there was an event on near by would be interested to see if this applies when a basket ball event is on near by what they mean is they can charge football fans full price this was not mentioned when booking so i was not happy the upshot was i went elsewhere for my drink another point they did not give me a wake up call in the morning even though i asked for one other than that for one night is the usual london football rip off
