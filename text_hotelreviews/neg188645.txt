there was a clear communication barrier between myself and staff at the restaurant over the phone for room service she wasn t able to understand english very well and became frustrated quickly when i asked questions about what s on offer she told me to look at the menu i asked for drinks and she also told me to look back at the menu as they re were no drinks on the menu it was clear the only way to get one with my food was to go downstairs which defeats the objective of room service also when our food came it came without the sauce stated on the menu i called back and rather than an apology she made out like the sauce was optional rather than part of the meal although that s not the case as calamari should definitely come with a sauce
