the location could have been better we got lost when we go there cause there was no directions on the road they only had the hotel name on the building itself rather high up the good side obviously was close to local tesco the designer outlet and visiting wembley stadium was fabulous the only struggle was commuting into central london there was transport access avialable but it could ve been better within a few hours of being our key pass for our room had broken which was frustrating after we was given a key but we didn t know where abouts it was as not on show but also down to lack of communication from staff but once a told shown it was okay staff were very friendly and lovely but on the odd occasion lacked to pass on information
