the only critisism i had is that i couldn t eat in the resteraunt and have it charged to my business i m an employee without a credit card and although my boss booked and paid for the room over the internet any extra s couldn t be charged to the same card without a form being filled out and signed by my boss and a copy of the front and back of the actual credit card surely a call from my boss to pay over the phone like you can anywhere else would have been fine like i said this is the only problem i had everything else was really good
