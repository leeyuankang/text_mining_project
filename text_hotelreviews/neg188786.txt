the balcony was never cleaned in the days we were there the first day coffee and tea were left including water but as the week went on they became less and less the carpet wasn t hoovered only chair the wifi was rubbish and we only managed to connect on the last day no information pack at all nothing to guide you the rates should include the buffet breakfast the reception staff were not overly friendly and appear very aloof for a brand new hotel there are many things they need to sort out before i would even think about going back
