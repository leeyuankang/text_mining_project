firstly the walk from the tube station to the hotel is not described correctly as it is probably a walk wheni got to the hotel i was informed that the hotel had a system error and that they did not receive my booking and subsequently cancelled my booking apparently they tried calling me times that morning but could not get a hold of me as my cell number number was incorrect however they failed to use the south african dialed code staff and manager in particluar were rude and unhelpful had to sit in the hotel lobby for hours trying to find alternate accomodation what was strange is that this occurred to other guests as well who used a booking agent to make their booking so was this just a way of the hotel trying not to pay commission to these agents by taking only direct booking
