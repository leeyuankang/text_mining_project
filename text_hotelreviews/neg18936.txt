the first room we were put in superior was lovely and had separate shower and bath unfortunately there were noisy children running around above us and i asked to be moved the second room appeared smaller and without separate shower which was disappointing please note that the first room s shower drain i think it was smelt terrible and we were able to detect the odour as soon as the door to the room was open and it was even worse when we went into the bathroom the drain needs changing or at least a professional clean both rooms showed wear and tear we didn t dine in the hotel as there was so much choice elsewhere however if the prices had been more competitive then i think we would have done
