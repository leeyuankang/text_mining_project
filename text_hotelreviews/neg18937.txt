i didn t leave my card details when i first checked in and wanted to use the mini bar i called down to reception to add my card details but couldn t get through i called times with no reply so called room service and explained i wanted to add my card onto the room so i could use the mini bar but they couldn t help and offered to put me through i was then on hold again for minutes without answer in the end i gave up as i didn t want to get dressed to walk down to reception for what should have been a simple task
