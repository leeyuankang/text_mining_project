i would say this hotel was more of a hotel check in was clumsy the card was taken twice incorrectly and we even had a phone call during the day asking us to return and re do the card the whole process seemed confused and time consuming a negative first impression the rooms overlooked the breakfast atrium and other peoples rooms this felt quite strange and not something i had realised when booking one of the reasons i booked the hotel was due to the pictures of the large terrace over looking st pauls cathedral as this was a leisure visit with friends and there was nice weather planned when we checked in we found this had been hired for a private party so we never got to see this instead we chose the bar in the lounge for a pre show drink and quick bite to eat the waiter was bordering on rude and the service was lack luster food was ok to be fair and as expected in summary this hotel would be fine for a business stay and is step above a premier inn but fell short of my expectations and the price paid
