check in took too long also they would not let anyone check in early not even by an hour i had to wait in the lounge and line up all over again to obtain a keycard the bathroom needs work i could not get cold water from the sink the glass partition along the tub is too small it runs only the length of the tub itself leaving your backside exposed the shower head is not adjustable it only sprays straight down about a foot from the wall so to get under the water you have to stand at the very front of the tub pressed closely to the wall where much of the water is being sprayed the bed linens were not very soft
