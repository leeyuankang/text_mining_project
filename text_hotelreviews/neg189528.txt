the spa was meant basically for people even though is open for everybody but that s its maximum capacity so you have to wait if there s someone else using it the water of the jacuzzi was cold and it couldn t be adjusted so we basically used the turkish bath which was quite good there was no sauna so if you go only for the spa beware that it s really small and not at its best
