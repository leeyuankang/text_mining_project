we requested early check in as my girlfriend was ill upon arrival the room was not ready the lady at our check in was very cold and did not show any anticipation on the situation i requested a call to my mobile when the room would be available that call never came my girlfriend stayed at the lobby and when she after a few hourse checked if the room was available suddenly it was but nobody made the effort to call me or inform her also room cleaning was badly we did not receive water in the room during our day stay i remember you get a new bottle once a day day the room was only half cleaned and meft like that with the trash still in the room some things on the floor this is very different from my normal experience in this hotel and most likely i will not return as there are other alternatives in the area in the same quality price range where we did never experience this
