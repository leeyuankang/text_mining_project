the staff definitely needs more training to work in a star hotel they don t really appreciate the essence of customer service example we were in a rush in the morning and cannot have a sit down breakfast i asked for something to takeaway the staff at first told me they can t do it breakfast can only be eaten in the hotel i spent another minute persuading her we just needed something simple like a sandwich and that we really don t have the time to sit down eventually we convinced her to make us the sandwiches but the relationship is gone example the check in service was more complicated than it needs to be we were told that we must present the credit card used during booking otherwise they can t check us in that strict rule was not mentioned before arrival eventually we found the credit card but we really didn t need this stressful experience on arrival if this was such a critical rule then it should be noted before arrival so that we are aware of it
