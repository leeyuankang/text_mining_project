the only thing i wasn t sold on at the front desk they offer tickets to popular attractions so that you don t have to wait in the ticket queues however these tickets don t get you out of the security queues we waited close to two hours to get into the musee d orsay do you research it may be possible to skip those queues as well if you book through a tour company we didn t explore that option but it may have saved us some time that s not the hotel s fault though just a note
