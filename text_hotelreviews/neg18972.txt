we were charged an extra for an early check in when we had paid for two rooms for night i thought that was ridiculous especially as one of the rooms they downgraded upon returning to the hotel the security guard was rude and refused to let us in initially as each person didn t have there own room key we stated our names and room numbers and he still made us wait for minutes not happy after that at reception called our room about an incident i knew nothing about and started barraging me with questions whilst i was half a sleep then they called back minutes later and tried having another conversation with me in the middle of the night and finally to top it off the fire alarm was set off at causing us all to leave our room i was very very disappointed and cannot display how angry i was that evening disgusting
