we chose this hotel because we had stayed a few years ago but we now know that we paid well over the website tariff for this stay very disappointed that no breakfast was included staff in the hotel and cafe were very unhelpful there was no information in the room about breakfast options when we asked at reception where breakfast was served we were told through that door which was marked dining room but nothing else was explained when we went through in the morning it was door into a health food cafe and the options for breakfast were from the quite specialist cafe menu with matching prices no option for e g toast and cereal and the cost for coffee and tea was ridiculous for a hotel breakfast when we queried the menu explaining that we were hotel guests we were told quite rudely that it was up to us to choose from the menu and pay full price we went to another cafe round the corner and paid a reasonable price for a simple breakfast we will not be back
