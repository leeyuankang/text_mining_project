the facts and websites introduction are slightly different for example their website said that most of their rooms have shower bathtub but it isn t true the staff told me that only the family room has a bathtub moreover the website also said that they provide toiletries but they only have shampoo and conditioners no body wash last but not least i wrote to them asked for a room with a bathtub they replied yes but when i got there they provided me with a room without a bathtub which was disappointing and annoying
