room is a shoebox i ve stayed at this hotel a number of times over the years on business trips i ve always been impressed spotless rooms comfortable beds and good location however this room did not live up to my expectations it was the last room available when i booked so i was aware there was no en suite which to be fair i ve always booked before however the bathroom was on a different floor and my room did not have space for a sink
