we had a huge issue with the late night staff member not letting my husband in when i was asleep despite confirming that this would be ok times twice before we had even turned up when i spoke to the staff member in the morning he said that he couldn t identify him and didn t know if he should let him in so decided not to my husband had then travel back to bedford after finishing a hour night shift who just wanted a couple of hours sleep this cost my husband a lot of money to travel back to our home and i was very very angry to know that he hadn t been let in i have heard nothing back despite being told they would call me during the day to confirm what had happened i will not be staying here again and i would advise against staying here if you need to check in separately as apparently the staff do not communicate with each other
