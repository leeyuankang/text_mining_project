there is no breakfast included but can be bought in the cafe next door the wording in the information about the hotel could definitely be better than sounding as if it is included would still have booked it the room was extremely hot when i arrived in the evening however woke up at am freezing cold as the radiators were switched off and didn t come on until in the morning it was not possible to operate them from the room blankets could definitely have been provided in the rooms
