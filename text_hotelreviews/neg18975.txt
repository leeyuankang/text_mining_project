spent the day in the spa except the hammam suite was not in use there was a sign on the door of the suite saying that it was booked for a private party although we did not see anyone leave or enter the hammam suite all day nobody could withstand the heat in the suite for more than minutes let alone all day i suspect the suite might have been broken but instead of admitting this a phoney excuse was given i suspect anyway also when in the spa a group of young male teenagers proceeded to take photos of themselves in the pool and using the facilities i found this rather uncomfortable and no member of staff seemed to approach them on why they were taking pictures in a spa i just didn t feel it was up to star standard unfortunately however room was lovely and comfortable and the location is great for the theatre district
