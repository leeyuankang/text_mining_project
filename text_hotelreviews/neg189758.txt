room the size of a cupboard shared bathroom which was down two flights of stairs and bed located directly below a very cold draughty window location was good for my business trip but did not stay the last night of the booking as just couldn t face it if you choose to book here do not get misled by the room facilities as it definitely does not have a toilet or shower in the room or anywhere close by a disappointing experience and certainly would not stay here again a real shame because the staff were great
