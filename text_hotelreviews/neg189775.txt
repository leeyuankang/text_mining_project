i took the basic single room on the understanding that i would share a bathroom i have stayed there many times before with an ensuite bathroom what i didn t know was that to reach the shared bathroom i had to go through two fire doors and down a flight of stairs into a communal area to reach any source of water and the toilet i found this very inconvenient as i had made the assumption that the shared bathroom would be in the bedroom area i would have been happier if this had been described on the website as for many people it would not have been a problem for me it was i would stay there again but not in that room
