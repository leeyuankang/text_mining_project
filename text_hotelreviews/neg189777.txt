breakfast the guest information booklet included information about an english style breakfast which is no longer available this information needs to be removed from the booklet because it is misleading breakfast in fact is vegetarian and the full english they now offer includes avocados and spinach etc this is my only complaint in every other way i thought it was a nice hotel in a good location and very convenient for getting into london
