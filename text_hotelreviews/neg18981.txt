for a star hotel the technology in the room is really out of date the tv was tiny and they asked for a deposit just so we could unlock the pin to use the bluetooth we only wanted to watch catch up tv on the bigger screen rather than our phone but we were told the may take up to weeks to return there reasoning was we could watch lots of movies and run up a big bill ridiculous and i refused to pay it on principle i ve stayed in many lesser starred hotels in london where movies are free and you can use an i pad or such like to control lights tv etc this place needs to catch up with the times
