the room was very cold no heating and the staff unhelpful my daughter was told it was up to her to turn the heating on she is only the room s heating should have been checked prior to arrival the weather had dropped to freezing over the weekend my daughter waited in the breakfast area for over minutes and no one came to serve the kitchen staff were just chatting in the kitchen this was one of many visits our family has made to the hotel usually we have been very happy but this time the care and service were very disappointing
