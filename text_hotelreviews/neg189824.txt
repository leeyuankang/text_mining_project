the hotel has increased the breakfast charge to which appears to be more than the charge for non residents ordering off its standard menu at this pricing point you would probably expect it to be inclusive and the portions could have been more generous room was comfortable and well appointed bar some traffic noise from outside and from adjacent rooms and a hole in the ceiling of the bathroom my general feeling was the hotel was clean and comfortable but that the tariff was around too high
