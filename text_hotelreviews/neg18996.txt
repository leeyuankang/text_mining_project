i was travelling with a colleague on business and we arrived at the hotel at pm local time am for us we had booked a superior twin room and noted that when checking in we got a room with one double bed we went back to the reception and asked for a twin room we were assured that the next one is a twin room it was a double we went back to the reception and were then told that superior twin in that hotel only comes with one double bed and we need to pay extra to get an executive room with two beds alternatively one of us could sleep on the sofa bed in the room we declined and proposed to give us both of the rooms we had already been sent to regardless we were told that the hotel was fully booked we showed our booking but the staff maintained that according to their web page superior twin had just one bed when asked to show a print out of the web page it did not concur their position until then still no apologies from the staff and no real proposals for solving the situation they obviously had an executive twin available but were not offering a free upgrade so we finally proposed that they could pull the double bed apart which they finally agreed to do we got to the third room an hour later the small beds were really uncomfortable since there were no cover mattresses and we got old lumpy blankets we had a third colleague staying at the same hotel she had booked a superior double when we got to her room the next morning we realised that she had a superior twin so superior twin rooms with beds do exist in the hotel and the staff just blatantly lied on sevaral occasions
