the breakfast was cold and very over priced was not happy with it at all and had bad stomach rest of the day oh and one thing that is more of an annoyance really but there were no plug sockets by the bed so couldn t keep phone by bed which i find very annoying staff were lovely and very willing to help though so no complaints there at all and hotel itself very smart and everything looked nice but the breakfast which i was looking forward to was the biggest let down only had a tiny amount of cold cooked breakfast that was enough to put me off it really was that bad and sadly it really spoiled the stay
