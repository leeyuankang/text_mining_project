i stay in this hotel times a year but yet no one recognises me or greet me as a member they said it is because i did my booking through booking com the system does not recognise my membership empty bottles from minu bar and used glasses were not taken out for two days when i called housekeeping they said i have to take them outside myself or throw them on the bin as they are not allowe to take anything out from the room when i checked out i told them i was waiting for a delivery and will wait at their bar the staff said i have to tell the concierge myself as they are not taking that kind of message well the concierge is next to them i guess everybody is just doing their job and not focus on client satisfaction
