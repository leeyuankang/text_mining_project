we had issues with our electronic key everyday it deactivated it wasn t kept near our phones but somehow there was an issue the staircase for our bed was steep and no handrail the tea coffee facilities weren t updated daily and the floor was dusty and had hair on it and that was upon our arrival that situation didn t change other than those minor issues the hotel was lovely
