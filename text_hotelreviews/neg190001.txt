arrived at hotel past and they were not ready for us unacceptable housekeeping did a quick job but room was not clean requested for room to be cleaned but housekeeping didn t come anytime soon and we just told them to forget it and come the next day booked a club room for three had to request for an additional set of towels for the third guest hotel only provided one bar soap for all guests and this was not replenished the next day we had to make two requests and then ask the housekeeper directly before we got hold of one bar soap tea cups were provided for only two guests throughout the stay it is odd that we paid for three yet the hotel was only ready to provide a room for two room allowed use of the club lounge great but also meant that our included breakfast could only be consumed at the club lounge we could only eat at the restaurant downstairs at a cost of pounds this was not explicitly stated in the booking terms and conditions needless to say the restaurant on the ground floor has more space and more variety of food provided it made no sense to me that guests who had breakfast included had to pay an additional pounds to enjoy the a slightly better breakfast in a more comfortable area do note that booking fee for the room was also rather steep they should have just allowed guests the choice on where they would prefer to have their breakfast having patronised this hotel several times before and recommended them to other friends i was left very disappointed with the service this time around a lot can and should be improved for a four star hotel upon check out i enquired about the booking rates for two weeks later should i wish to return receptionist explained that it would be better for me to book online on their website as i would be able to make use of a discount voucher she handed me a voucher that expired on june i checked out on july think this pretty much sums up everything
