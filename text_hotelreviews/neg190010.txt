we booked a club room rate including breakfast actually for club rooms the hotel provides breakfast at the club small lounge tables and seats etc not comfortable and certainly not healthy with a small buffet if you want to join the big breakfast buffet in the restaurant they try to charge you with additional pp it took us a long and intense discussion at the checkout to not be charged for these extra costs
