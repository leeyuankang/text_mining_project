this hotel is a poor excuse for a star my bed linens were torn and had holes the shower tub had cracks the bathroom floor was frozen cold and there were no slippers in the room nor robes by the way the room in itself was cold i increased the temperature of the heater but it didn t change anything the mattress needed to be refreshed overall highly disappointed
