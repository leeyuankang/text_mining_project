an earlier phone call to reception before arrival to inform them that a parcel was being delivered which we had previously been told was no problem was met with a very terse and unhelpful male receptionist who said it would not be accepted as we were not yet booked in and it was due to their proximity to the us embassy as this was a wedding present for the couple getting married and staying with us in the hotel the suggestion that it could be delivered later was neither helpful or practical we decided to do nothing and were informed a day later by the courier that it had been delivered on check in i asked for it and it was handed over with no problem so what was the point of causing such uncertainty one small but unsettling incident in an otherwise pleasant stay
