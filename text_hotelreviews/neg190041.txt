the receptionist who booked us in initially said wifi was not free and we would have to pay and offered a package of two breakfast vouchers and wifi for when i said i didn t want wifi and complained it should be free it suddenly was if i added my name to their mailing list watch out for that money making scam we were kept awake from am til morning by a couple screaming at each other for hours on end and running numerous baths it was torture and then choosing a hot brekfast at am which was stone cold was the last straw after a sleepless night i was glad to leave
