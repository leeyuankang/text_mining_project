was there with a group and everyone complained the rooms were too hot as air conditioning in rooms not working properly i had an engineer up who said it was on heating i asked for the window to be opened and he had to remove screws i think it s a cost saving measure as other guests complained at reception bathrooms could do with an overhaul
