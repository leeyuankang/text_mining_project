our first rooms booked were classified as standard and seemed tired and quite dull so we paid for an upgrade and had two adjoining large rooms which were much more to our liking lighting was poor and there was evidence of a lacking of maintenance whb could not retain water and bathroom door hook loose and hanging from door marble flooring stained and gave impression of being dirty unfair to cleaning staff as marble requires polishing and resealing main criticism is that one bathroom had no separate shower cabinet and over bath shower potentially dangerous as bath high the outstanding situation of this hotel makes it hugely desirable i also respect and appreciate the logistical challenge of running such a large establishment
