the pillows were hard as bricks our room was like a sauna the air con didn t work however after calling the duty manager an engineer was sent who quickly fixed it this man was extremely helpful even ringing us back to check if temp had dropped he brought us a portable fan as well as giving us the option to change to a cooler room so we felt he went beyond the call of duty and was very polite
