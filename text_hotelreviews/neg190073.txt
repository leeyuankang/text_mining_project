this was a gift for my parents birthday and when they arrived they were told they could not check in as i was not there with the card it was paid on this caused a lot of stress as i was at home and couldn t do anything about it i was spoken to by a rude manager who wasn t very helpful i was upset as it had ruined the start of the weekend for my parents luckily this was quickly sorted and they got on with the trip and had a wonderful time
