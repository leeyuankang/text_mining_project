staff not very good at communicating with guests or each other got served a smaller drink than advertised ordered then they still tried to charge for the larger drink even after apologising for serving me the smaller one don t bother paying the extra for the club room if you plan to use the private club bar the club bar is basically a converted bedroom and full of families with small children even at when it closes on the occasions we visited not really set up for a quiet drink
