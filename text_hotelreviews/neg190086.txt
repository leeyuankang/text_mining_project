the room was very run down there was a pull out bed and we had twin beds even though we booked a double we were fobbed off with an excuse that they upgraded us to a bigger room did the bigger room i want just a decent bed the carpet was disgusting and had cigarette burns in it the room smelled like smoke we struggled to sleep and their solution was to mask it with air freshener to make it even worse
