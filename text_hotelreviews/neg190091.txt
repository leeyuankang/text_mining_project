i booked this hotel for my wife and her friend there was some problems cheking in as the booking was made using my credit card and they requested a fax i don t know how they were able to charge my card over the internet but for checking in they needed a fax which was really hard to find a place with a fax nowadays and they actually provided a solution that they will take cash money instead of the credit card after an hour of waiting i never knew that checking in to hotel would be so complicated
