the superior room was very small and the decor was tired and dated unfortunately the beds were very hard and the double bed only had one side table there were also no drawers to store clothes only an open wardrobe area to hang them with one shelf above which had no door the bathroom was also very small with old peeling paint around mirror and no fan or toilet brush the shower had a broken head which made the water squirt at all angles the room had a locked adjoining door which was not sound proofed and we could hear our neighbors a lot sorry but the room was not worth the price paid
