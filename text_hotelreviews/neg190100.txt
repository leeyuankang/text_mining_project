internet is extra value for the money is so and so although booking com confirmed to me the availability of the room when i reached there the room was not available totally shocking for me rather than upgrading me to the next room at free of charge as the availability of the room was not due to my mistake i was forced to pay for the upgrade or i was told that i will need to find another hotel not very pleasant situation
