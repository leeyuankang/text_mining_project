it was my first stay in london so i wanted to be centrally located we were in several cities in europe and to be honest this hotel was my least favorite the fact that it was double what the next most expensive hotel we stayed at probably made things worse but we found it to be lacking in the luxury one would expect at over a night mediocre at best
