we had a long and difficult journey in to london and we where hot and sweaty we were late checking in because the room was not ready and just wanted to go to our room and freshen up on a positive note they did give us some free drinks vouchers but this was no substitute for not getting straight in our room which was basic and we were only there one night to do some christmas shopping
