hotel is looking extremely tired our room was in need of new facilities many staff newer ones also need to be taught common standards such as smiling please and thank you s we also could not access the club lounge on either day due to it being over capacity we had to then go eat downstairs at the restaurant and we re told that they should have been informed not really our problem however should be sorted by the hotel team not the guests problem apart from that we love the reception team parking team brian barry and omah as well as dennis from the bar who keep us going back there
