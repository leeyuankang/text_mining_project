our room was first floor and the view from our window was completely covered by the air conditioning units of the hotel we expected a much nicer outlook from our room especially as it cost us over a night when we asked for another room we were told there was nothing available so rather than waste more time trying to explain to another foreign receptionist we left the hotel and went out in london to enjoy ourselves
