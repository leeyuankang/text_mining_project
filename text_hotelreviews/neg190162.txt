the room we were moved to was shabby in terms of it s d cor and bathroom fittings and was at the back of the hotel although in fairness it was much quieter and the room and bedding were clean the cooked breakfast was cold but there were other choices overall a disappointment as we have stayed in this hotel before and been very pleased
