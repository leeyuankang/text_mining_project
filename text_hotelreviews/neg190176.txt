the service provided in this hotel was below my expectations one example i asked to the concierge to book a taxi yesterday morning answer don t worry you don t need to book taxi there is a line in front of the hotel when i arrived no taxi was there i missed by train because i had to find one by my own of course nobody was in front of the hotel or in the lobby to help me i am disappointed and will not come back
