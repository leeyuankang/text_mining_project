being a londoner i am more than used to paying london alcohol prices in mayfair chelsea but charging for a double hendricks gin and tonic is ludicrous and on top of that it was served in a small catering glass with very little ice we couldn t help but feel this was a complete rip off the spa was also very messy and not relaxing at all floats and hoists were left around with rolls of tissues all over the place not great for a hotel offering spa facilities i will not be coming back to stay in the hotel or to use the spa
