the hotel is well positioned and the rooms are spacious and clean check in was from mid afternoon so when we tried to check in at we were told our room wasn t yet ready to me this is unacceptable and after expressing that to the desk receptionist she found us a room we were running late for an event so the slow check in experience wasn t ideal
