room was tired both in decor dirty marks and stains on every wall and furniture the bathroom had missing mastic seats and mould growth behind taps not eat l expected for nearly per night breakfast was chaotic with tables too small for anything more than one person there was also insufficient seating even allowing for staggered use between and in all it was clearly designed to encourage people to pay extra and either eat in their rooms or the restaurant very disappointing
