it is not really a fault of the hotel as it was a business trip and paid for through an agent you don t exactly get the best rooms and things were missing from the room when i checked in for example coat hangers and an iron this was remedied very quickly though this would not deter me from staying again would highly recommend that the bathrooms are updated and include a walk in shower the internet also needs to be improved as it is important when working i am sure this is going to be sorted as soon as possible as this is a basic requirement nowadays
