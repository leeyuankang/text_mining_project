housekeeping services are really bad and no initiative housekeeping did not clean and tidy our room and one of my valuable things has been stolen by the house keeper also the concierge service is so bad i missed my train because of waiting for someone from the concierge to pick up my luggage from the room and i had to take all my luggage from two rooms downstairs by myself and they didn t even help me downstairs the rooms and the toilets are very old and used they need to be refurbished it s not my issue if the hotel is full and they don t have enough stuff to work in the hotel this hotel was the worst i stayed in london and it doesn t deserve five stars
