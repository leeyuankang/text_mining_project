i didn t really like the menu the food selection wasn t my type of food at all and i didn t feel there was much to choose from the staff didn t seem overly friendly just very serious whereas most places i have been they are always happy chatty and very welcoming location was perfect just a short walk down to oxford street and i have to say that made it totally worth it
