i booked nights arrived around midnight first night and had no room had to go to another hotel of the millennium chain second night had a room and was upgraded to a superior room room very noisy due to location in the hall close to lifts and bathtub did not operate well due to poor plumbing shower with water up to my ankles asked for repair twice and i they did not repair and ii did not say anything next morning same problem claimed at reception and was moved to another room new upgrade but the plumbing issue simply remained the same appears to be a general problem wi fi is free but does not work properly it is ridiculous
