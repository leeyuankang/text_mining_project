i upgraded to club room at checking and they charged us when we had breakfast at the ground floor when i was upgrading they didn t tell me breakfast included only in club lounge which is a shame you would expect to have good breakfast at club lounge but there was soo little compare to what was being offered in ground floor also the internet was rubbish we have no coverage in room there was only network near the corridors some days room service was so bad they would take soup and hotel shampoos and wouldn t replace them with new ones also one day we got a towel which a gum was stuck to it
