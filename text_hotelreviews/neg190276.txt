the room service we ordered was poor quality when i called room service they advised to order something else which took a long time to come to the room we was not offered anything extra or discount as a goodwill gesture also found a hair in the chicken sausages at breakfast advised the service manager in which he answered it would have been guest as the kitchen staff wear hair nets shame as this let the whole experience down especially as i was celebrating a big birthday
