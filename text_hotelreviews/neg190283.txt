frankly i would never recommend this hotel to anyone despite it being ideally located i paid an extra on the spot to be upgraded to a king bed room but found myself on the first floor overlooking the courtyard in a ice cold room where the wifi didn t reach the bed so i paid something like for a poor internet that barely worked in the bathroom the staff were nonchalant apart from the concierge and my room smelt like mold like i said would never recommend this hotel to anyone
