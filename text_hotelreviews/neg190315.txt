there was a problem with the bathroom sliding door and one of us got trapped in there had to be rescued by a very helpful maintenance man but the door couldn t be repaired until we left the room so we had no privacy in the bathroom the manager was very apologetic and offered an upgrade for our next visit the email hasn t materialised so far
