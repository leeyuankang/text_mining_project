staff were rude room was not cleaned by when the lady did come to clean the room we had just got back and we asked if she could come back in minutes she sighed and frowned at us and never came back we were a group of people and everyone had different experiences with the staff we ordered breakfast from the menu toast beans mushrooms it took minutes we asked if we could serve ourselves as the same food was on the buffet but we couldn t because we didn t order the full breakfast some had to cancel and others had to eat quickly as we were catching flights they would not allow my friend to enter her room when she arrived as she did not have the card that the room was booked under even though the room was prepaid she had just travelled hours from houston she had to wait until i arrived hours later which resulted in me missing an appointment the same situation happened to another colleague but she was allowed to access her room
