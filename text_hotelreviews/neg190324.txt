took a long time to check into my room although my brother found his room ready i had to stay in his room and kept calling reception to send the keycard up after my room was ready after calling a few times and being tired i went down myself to get the key i stayed in this hotel years ago it was an amazing first time experience in london i cant say the same for this visit
