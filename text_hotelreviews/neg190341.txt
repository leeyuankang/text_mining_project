the stay was unfortunately spoilt for us due to issues both nights that we stayed here the hotel room was very cold from arrival and although the hotel sent a portable heater to try to combat this it did make the room quite uncomfortable it s expected that everyone enjoys different temperatures in their room however usually you can control this yourself and aren t left frozen from bed to bathroom as we stayed for a few nights we requested to move rooms and the hotel staff were very helpful however our stay in the new room was unfortunately again spoilt by the first floor corridors and room itself smelling particularly unpleasant although again the manager was very helpful after we requested to speak with her regarding this it isn t what was expected of a star hotel and i wouldn t recommend to a friend
