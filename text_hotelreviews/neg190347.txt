my only gripe and it is the same for all star hotels is the exorbitant price charged for soft drinks over for ml of coke is ridiculous and out of order a thousand percent mark up or more for soft drinks is outrageous and hotels should think again this is no encouragement to use the bar especially if you do not drink alcohol
