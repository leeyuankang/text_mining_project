our room had secondary glazing broken missing so very noisy and cold when we arrived back after evening out and early morning the bathroom hinge was virtually hanging off so you couldn t shut door let alone lock it we defo would have complained if it hadn t been so late arriving back and didn t fancy changing rooms at am we did tell concierge when checking out and said they d address the problems however that doesn t help our stay and upon arriving home you can see these issues have been brought up before and obviously done nothing about them apart from these two things it was great but these are terrible things to overlook easy to say we will look at it how about a gesture of good will a partial refund or offer rather than a promise it will get fixed which you are obviously not doing as the problems are still there
