well the first thing i didn t like was the fact that you pay a lot of money for the pleasure of the room but when you come to check in the reception staff wanted more money from you for deposit this wasn t stated at time of booking another one of my bad experiences with this hotel was i originally booked the hotel on new years ever for new year to my horror on the december i was advised that the hotel had canceld my reservation for the december via email when phoning the hotel the man i spoke with was unhelpful and advised me their was nothing he could do and to contact booking com for them to deal with the issue in total trying to get the room rebooked took me hours as i was getting passed from pillar to post but i eventually got the issue resolved me and my partner made the drive down to london we had a brilliant time bringing the new year in where now home and still waiting for the deposit to be refunded to my bank account
