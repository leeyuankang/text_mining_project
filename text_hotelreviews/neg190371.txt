it was all terrible from the delay in checking in to changing the beds into two singles which i had requested the room was smaller than what was stated on the website the bed was uncomfortable and hard the plug in sockets were scattered unevenly around the room which was irritating when trying to plug somthing in the bathroom was vile the size was absolutely tiny and the bathtub was dirty and slightly grimy later during my stay i was watching television and i get a knock on the door from security saying there s too much noise in the room the television was not even loud the cheek and basic disrespect from staff was terrible disturbing
