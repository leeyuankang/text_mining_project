there was a confusion at the breakfast because apparently the breakfast vouchers do not entitle you to choose from the menu however nobody has explained it to us before buying the vouchers it happens that we wanted to order from the menu and then had to have or conversations about it with the staff it looked like some training around the voucher concept would have been appropriate to both reception and f b staff together with customer focus to their point we ended up not having to pay any extra but felt like having been done a favour and the situation was unpleasant and ruined our breakfast experience the eggs benedict were wonderful though
