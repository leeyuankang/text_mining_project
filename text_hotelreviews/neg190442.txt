i had requested for a room overlooking the front rather than the back of the property and was told that a room with a view would cost extra again i informed them of an early check in as my flight schedule dictated but the room they claimed was booked for me was not ready even with the payment of early check in fee i did not like the room allocated but agreed to wait till for the originally scheduled room the room was never ready the front office staff did try their best to help but the duty manager did not find a need to speak with me despite my protestations at the room i was given if she was the one i spoke with on the phone then she is very rude and not an asset to the hotel the house keeping was very very poorly done they failed to clean or take away cups and cutlery that had been used the waste basket was not emptied i observed clothing from a previous occupant under the sofa and this remained there for the three nights i stayed despite the room being cleaned everyday
