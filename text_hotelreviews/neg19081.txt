as a returning guest i also recommended the hotel to friends who were delighted they had a great stay but this time i was very disappointed with my bed and the linen it did not feel smell fresh and i spoke to the manager about this certainly the pillows and mattress protector need to be replaced i hope they have done this usually i am very pleased with my room
