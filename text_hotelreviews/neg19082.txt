make sure you check your room prior to check in i booked a twin room and the description did not match the room i received i was given a very tiny and somewhat squashed obvious double room which had been turned into a twin room this was not well done because one bed was right under the lamp which i banged my dad on throughout the night i gave feedback but was to tired to swap rooms so was given a complimentary breakfast which wasnt a five star breakfast i much preferred the tower bridge branch this room was not value for money
