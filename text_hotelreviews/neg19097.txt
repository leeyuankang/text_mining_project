room described as an executive double per night had internally facing floor to ceiling window onto the atrium but literally faces onto the scenic glass elevator about feet away which is constantly going up and down the atrium this meant that anyone in the glass lifts has a birds eye view into the room at all times we had to shut the curtains all day room lighting is very dim so it was rather a gloomy stay reception staff were not v polite and our checkin was delayed by hours as our room was not ready at as promised in the booking not a good start no compensation given pool is nice but nowhere to sit around it so you either swim or stand
