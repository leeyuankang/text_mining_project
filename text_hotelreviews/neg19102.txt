some reception staff do not have good customer service skills my room bookings were mixed up and my son was asked to pay again for the room i had already paid for which caused some embarassment after checking and confirming the room was paid for was no apology made just its ok the rooms were also miles apart as we were advised that one of the rooms had been rebooked so not great despite this the hotel is nice the corcierge lads were very professional and the location is good
