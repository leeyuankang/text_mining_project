our room was v dated and not particularly clean dusty the service at reception was slow and at times the staff while friendly weren t knowledgable unable to answer if there is drinking water in room or ability to put coffee on room bill overall aside from pool and gym i don t see how this qualifies as a luxury hotel particularly in london and as such not great value
