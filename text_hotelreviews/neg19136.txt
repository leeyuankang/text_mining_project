paid for a night and not even a bottle of water in the room tap water was luke warm so that wasn t a good alternative couldn t see if any could even buy from the mini bar as it was locked as i had said i wouldn t be needing to pay a deposit to use it as arrived at and would be leaving at so thought wouldn t be needing mini bar i was there for business so fine but very corporate certainly not a place for a romatic mini break in london
