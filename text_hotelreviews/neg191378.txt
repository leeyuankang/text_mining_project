the staff didn t really know what they were doing as it was a new hotel i can understand this the rooms are incredibly small and impractical for example the basin is so big but there is no benchspace to put your toiletries and there is no door on the toilet there is a door to the bathroom but it doesn t go fully to the ground which means the toilet lacks privacy the food from the rooftop restaurant was average one of the lifts wasn t working for our entire stay
