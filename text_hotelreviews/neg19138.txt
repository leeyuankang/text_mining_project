extremely poor lighting and two broken lights in our room a little rough around the edges needs a deep cleanse no view from the room weren t told there was a dress down service in the room so felt uneasy when i returned to find that my room had been moved around whilst i was out there was a party on downstairs during our stay which was very loud and went on quite late i would not award this hotel star
