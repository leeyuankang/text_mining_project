the painful experience started with charging full nights for my business partner room despite it was cancelled more than days before check in date due to emergency trip cancellation death in the family front desk instead of finding a solution to refund the unjustified room charged she put the blame on booking com and told me its there policy which doesn t make sense because booking com is an e commerce intermediary platform and they don t collect room charges for themselves that was my response then the front desk lady she promised to discuss this matter with higher management and get back to me which never happened no one even bothered to contact me about the subject very bad i felt like been fooled when i checked in my room i discovered a serious security defect in the balcony door it can t close from inside the fixed key is misplaced outside the balcony door and balcony is shared with other rooms so its an easy access from the outside of course i informed the front desk and the show started each personnel started to throw the blame on somebody else security contractors house keeping quality check it was a nightmare eventually i proposed a solution for them by removing the fixed key from outside the door which ultimately was done on different subject room service i used to leave my room very early for meetings and came back after pm surprisingly my room wasn t serviced so i had to call the housekeeping to make up my room funny enough on my last day was the weekend the housekeeping came at am and woke me up despite the sign of do not disturb was hanging outside my door as usual lots of apologies also the room itself is nicely designed but poorly engineered the bathroom lights switch misplaced by the entrance of the room so if you need to switch on the lights in the bathroom you have to go all the way to the opposite side of the room
