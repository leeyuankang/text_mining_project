a lot of customer service issues still getting worked out it s a new place but i had a very frustrating experience i was so happy with my stay until day i was originally supposed to stay only one night but decided to extend when i spoke to the front desk that first evening about it he told me no problem and that they would give me the same rate as the first night from booking com he also didn t let me know that they were short on rooms i should have probably just extended then but i didn t know if i was able to change my train yet when i returned the following morning i was told by the front desk manager a curt unfriendly woman kind of surprised she s in customer service at such a nice hotel that they had no rooms however then after telling me they were full she said she found one but was raising the rate i was in a desperate situation at that point so i had to accept but the fact that she didn t honor the rate i was promised by another front desk person was incredibly bad customer service and internal communication
