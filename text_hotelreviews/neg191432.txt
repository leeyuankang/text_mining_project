staff a little abrupt on check in i requested early check in and was told mins which was fine great as i know this was a special request reappeared mins later to be told it is another mins came back after mins and was told another mins when i advised them what was happening i was told well this is a special request and it s up to our supervisors when the room is ready i think the staff were completely missing the point that actually my loan was about the fact that i could have not wasted over an our and a half of my time waiting around if i had been advised that a room would t be ready and that would have been fine not the best of starts or first impressions assist from that a good stay
