not a five star hotel good but not that good very pricey for what it is plus you can t use the mini bar to store your own stuff they charge if stuff is moved plus check in check out means if you staying one night you there for but paying rate for a hotel that charges for moving items in the mini bar i think it s only fair that i get a refund for the i was unable to occupy my room plus watch out for special rates they don t include breakfast which costs an extra
