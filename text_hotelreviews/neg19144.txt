staff was a little untrained someone walked into my room whilst i was getting changed he had knocked on the door once and then just unlocked the door even before i could say wait a minute please i rushed to the door as he was about to come in and i said that i wasn t dressed he apologised and waited outside while i got my dressing gown on then he came in and said that he was here to check the minibar which was locked so i don t quite understand what there was to check and then left quickly after apologising again i just thought that it was quite rude
