the facilities was good as per a star hotel but the service level was at best star the staff had difficulty communicating english level poor considering we are in england we paid extra fr my son who is year old per day fr a sofa bed the bed was so bad tht you could feel the springs coils under the mattress we had to ask twice and wait to get an extra duvet on the sofa bed to make it more comfortable
