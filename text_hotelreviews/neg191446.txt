it is a star hotel but i can t suggest anyone to go there do you know the feeling when you experience that the system and or the rules are more important then the guest i felt that my bad feelings at the check in i was on a business trip but for any reason unexpectedly i had to bring my year old child with me although the child slept with me in my bed i had to pay gbp extra night for the child i felt it unfair i had to pay for the accommodation in advance at the check in in the room by my surprise i couldn t open the minibar it was closed centrally when i looked out the window of my expensive room i could see backyards of untidy houses enclosed the picture i switched on the tv and i couldn t enjoy the program because the picture was just colour pixels and unrecognisable forms we went for dinner when i wanted to charge the bill to the room account they said that it was closed i had to pay cash or credit card finally i paid cash we went into the room and to bed at pm the in room phone ringed and waked up my son and myself a male voice told me that my bill at the restaurant was wrong for any reason and i had to go there immediately i kept my manner and politely told him morning during the night there was cold in the room although i adjusted the system to celsius in the morning than the system started to warm up the room but the next night it was could again probably the heating didn t work at night morning i went to the restaurant i asked what was wrong with the bill they said it was a mistake sorry can you imagine i didn t have breakfast there check out was smooth i didn t look back i never will
