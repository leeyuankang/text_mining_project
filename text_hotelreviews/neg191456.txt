our bed was not that comfortable and also hadn t been hooked together properly which resulted in me falling between the beds i will contacting the hotel about this personally on booking i had requested a view of the city but on arrival we had a room with no view at all just a curtain concealing an inside walkway the hotel staff said they could not change our room
