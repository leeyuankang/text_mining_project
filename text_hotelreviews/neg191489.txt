on arrival staff couldn t find my booking i also did not find them to be incredibly welcoming i also was not able to be given an umbrella which i would have though that in a city with wether like london they would have more then enough for all their guests very nice hotel i just think the service was not up to the standard of other hotels i have stayed in of similar quality and price
