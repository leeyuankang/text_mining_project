the staff no english for room service which meant trying to enjoy my christmas dinner in my room wasn t delightful at all having to wait for the right desert and for them having to phone back cause they didn t understand english i also didn t really enjoy the food too plain and also expensive also the jacuzzi was very cold on christmas day
