i have dietary intolerances and when i made a request for noodle stir fry the noodles were substituted for penne pasta i wasn t asked and it was not really what i wanted but because i was hungry and late i ate it i did bring it up with the staff and they just said it was because the noodle had gluten which was is fine but i would have preferred to have been told so i could change my order
