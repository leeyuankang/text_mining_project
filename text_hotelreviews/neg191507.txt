check in felt more like airport security rather than arrival as a guest at a luxury hotel i would expect robes to be in the room rather than having to request which took calls to chase up also there was only pair of slippers in our room and none in our dads room would expect pairs in each rather frugal with teabags bottled water and would have liked a small fridge to chill water and allow fresh milk for tea no body wash in bathroom shower cubicle doors didn t close properly and water seeped under and completely soaked bathroom floor so had to lay down towels to soak it up phoned for room service and was passed around to several places before reaching a slightly grumpy staff member who didn t seem too happy to take our order definitely not what i would expect especially in a star hotel the pool and facilities were great but unfortunately far from peaceful or relaxing due to screaming children and a group of men dive bombing and being very loud there was also a woman straddling her partner in the whirlpool which was highly inappropriate and the discomfort of others was obvious the lack of a lifeguard or some kind of patrol definitely allowed for behaviour to get out of hand which personally spoiled the whole pool experience for me
