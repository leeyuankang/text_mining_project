reception spa staff polite and professional but in their bid to maintain this no warmth or smile behind the welcome check in was a little slow via a tablet at the front desk photo id needed and all the room guests had to leave details and sign in rather than the lead guest more staff available at check out around as a busy time this was quite an expensive stay but comparable with other london hotels within this rating and i would stay again
