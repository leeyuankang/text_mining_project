group of four friends meeting in london but not travelling together the room was booked in my name we arrived at separate times and although they had the booking number my details and confirmation email were unable to check in without me eventually sorted out with great difficulty by a minute phone call on the train as i had no signal to email them as they had informed my friend she had to get me to do in order for her to check in disappointing given the star rating of the hotel the fact that the room was booked for people and my pregnant friend was made to wait in reception whilst all of this was resolved perhaps an email prior to arrival asking for other guests names would be useful if this is the policy as obviously not all groups arrive together
