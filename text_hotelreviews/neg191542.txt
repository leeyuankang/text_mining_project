baggage ticket was not passed from reception to concierge so we had to chase for them to be delivered to the room as we had to get to the theatre so ended up being a rush to get ready as we didn t get our bags for ages and because concierge didn t have the ticket they couldn t figure out which bags were ours which delayed it longer although concierge was very apologetic
