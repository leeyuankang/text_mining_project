the bar food was awful everything was very bland and tasteless couldn t finish my food dont get the tapas it all tastes the same the pool was very very cold and wasn t very relaxing as there were kids and parents being quite loud robes and slippers were not given to us in the spa so we had to go up to our room in just a towel there was only a few people eating in the main restaurant which made us feel a bit uncomfortable it wasn t a particularly good atmophere so we moved to the bar area also the food and drink looked quite expensive
