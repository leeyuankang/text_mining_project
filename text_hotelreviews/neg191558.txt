the bottom sheet on the bed did not fit as it was a lovely pillow top bed but a normal sheet annoying though with the sheet pulling up all the time and it looks tacky when you can see the mattress plus my daughter had a baby cot and they did not change her sheets or even fold her sheet for the three nights we were there which i thought was not good enough i could have called about it but it was too late each time we got back and i had to just put her to bed baby cots should be serviced along with the rest of the room
