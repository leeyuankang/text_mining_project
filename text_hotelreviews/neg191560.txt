after having a mix up issue in which i booked the hotel for the same day when i meant to book it for the month after for my girlfriends birthday i decided to call the hotel in hopes of them being able to change the dates of my stay they told me this was not possible and blamed the policy of booking com even though after speaking with a representative of booking com myself who called the hotel and was told they would not allow me to change the dates they then told me to call in the morning when i told them i was a student and this was for my girlfriend however i know it was just an excuse to make sure the time passed and i came up as a no show on their accounts and was charged anyway i was told basically to jog on in the morning and am now down because of it absolute scam
