we like to have a nightcap after a long day of sight seeing there was no ice available for us to get on our own we needed to call room service for a bucket of ice they acted as if this was a strange request if there was an empty shelf in the fridge to use for personal use would be nice i found it difficult to use the fridge without knocking things over a wash cloth supplied with the towels is a good idea an extra luggage stand would be helpful
