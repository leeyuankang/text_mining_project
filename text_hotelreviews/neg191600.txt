i stayed in the grange tower bridge last weekend and while it is comfortable and clean lets be clear that it is certainly no luxury star hotel by any regular standards of those who travel frequently for business or leisure and there are many hotels i have been to throughout europe that equal or exceed it however by average london standards it is passable areas where this hotel really fell short for me are invasive room services we came back to the hotel in an evening and it has been cleaned and the beds made great i then made my bed comfortable in the way i like it with untucking the duvet and removing all of the excess cushions etc and went out to dinner however during the time we were out to dinner the hotel staff again came into our room and re made the bed and put a survey paper on top of the pillow not only do i find it ridiculous and that hotel staff feel the need to come back into our room while we are out to dinner but to then re make the bed and put dirty paper on my pillow after i had already cleared it away and made things how i like it is a step too far and have never known of any other hotel to do this i was extremely unimpressed in fact i find it invasive and intrusive that people repeatedly came into our room outside of the usual cleaning hours without our request breakfast is an extortionate for a cooked breakfast buffet do not buy it typical london hotel rip off prices for what is a mass cooked buffet breakfast of distinctly less than average quality i know a certain purple budget hotel chain whose breakfasts far exceed this in quality there is a wetherspoons pub around the corner that do great fresh cooked breakfasts for and i highly recommend you go there instead of the lifts were out of order for most of the days i was there
