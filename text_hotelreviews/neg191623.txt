for breakfasts was a little steep and so weatherspoons next door had us and i am sure many more have chosen this option it was very expensive for breakfast especially when we ate at a celebrity chef restaurant the night we were in london for course for and he is a tv chef etc we thought was not money well spent on this occasion and did not reflect other restaurant breakfasts in compatible hotels waited hours for our dressing gowns to arrive as we had asked at the reception as we wanted to use the spa they did not arrive so we went to the spa anyway in the end and they phoned for us and they arrived within a few minutes wish we had known rather than wait for hrs
