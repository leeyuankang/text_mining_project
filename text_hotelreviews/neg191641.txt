bar area is very basic and if seated in the lounge opposite the bar there is no waiting service a la carte menu not available the excuse was valentine s weekend and the set food menu had limited choices nothing special in taste certainly not star cooking breakfast was also overrated with very limited choices for its price hotel location does not give it an advantage especially on the lower floors we stayed on the and there wasn t even a hotel car park or at least a service to drive our car to and from the car park
