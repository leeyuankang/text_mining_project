length of time we had to wait checking in put on extra staff at and again for check out we were given an automatic upgrade however when we got to the rooms they were not correct double we wanted twin beds i had to return desk and another two rooms were allocated elsewhere when i asked for a complimentary breakfast to compensate for the hour and half it took to get the whole thing sorted i was told i already had an upgrade when i pointed out that was their choice at the original booking and not something we requested it fell on deaf ears
