not the best location for tube travel as a lot of changes are needed to get to the more touristy parts of london however this is down to where you d like to visit if you wanted to see landmarks such as the tower of london the tower bridge and the embankment it s a great location also fairly close to st paul s for food etc it s a great place with a min walk to the embankment and places just over tower bridge
