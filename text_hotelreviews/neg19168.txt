i was told we d been upgraded we hadn t some of the furniture was damaged we asked for additional milk and were told to contact housekeeping or room service the much crowed about sky bar was closed we told reception staff that there were french fries spilled on the floor in the corridor two hours later there had been a half hearted attempt to clear them it looked more like someone had tried to kick them out of sight i accept the lifts will be busy at check out time but to have to stand for minutes frustratingly watch lifts either flash past or be too full isn t good especially when there s another lift within yards shame it wasn t sign posted i m sure it ticks all the boxes needed to classed as star but the lack of attention to detail means i ve stayed in better star hotels
