atmosphere it was like being in a vegas hotel with large groups of hen parties corporate groups and other party groups dominating the bar areas and hanging around the lobby with luggage food and attitude of restaurant staff my son was served a burger on a wooden board which was not clean when i complained the response was to blame me for some food i had shared with him i know the difference between strawberry jam and raspberry dressing the staff were rude and confrontational i preferred not to spoil our evening and so let it go to our cost the next day our son was violently sick
