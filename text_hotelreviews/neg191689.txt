for a star hotel bar area felt like an extension of the voyer and lacked character arrived back from dinner at pm and no seats available in the bar area per night nights and on check in offered full breakfast for an extra per person per night didn t take it up have stayed in other star hotels and felt very welcomed not this time to be fair the bar staff where very friendly and service speedy on the friday late afternoon
