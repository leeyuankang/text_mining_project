we were traveling with our year old boy we had a babysitter taking care after him while me and my husband were attending a program at the hotel apart from our room itself there was literally no place where he could stay during the day we were asked not to bring him to the reception area not to bring him in front of the conference center etc this made our situation quite difficult and exhausting especially on the last day after check out but the program was still on fact i would not recommend for people with children we were aware that our little boy is a problem to this hotel this is the first and last time we did such experience so far and we do travel very often with him
