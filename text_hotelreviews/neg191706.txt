breakfast was expensive for a continental breakfast but tensely everything i looked for from bowls to milk glasses to bread had run out and i had to ask for them to be replenished the fruit was all tinned which is disappointing esp in the middle of summer coffee was difficult to get tiny cups yiu had to chase the waiter around the restauraunt to get a second cup
