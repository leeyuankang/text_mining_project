staff are mainly untrained young people checkin and checkout was a catastrophy waited each time half an hour for my turn and then didn t even know how to handle their own software in addition i could not reach the room service by phone at pm in the evening when i needed another toothbrush breakfast a bit of old jam and bread not worth the money no one came to offer a second cup of coffee or tea during breakfeast don t want to be too picky but for this kind of hotel and money you pay i expect sth much better this was more worthy to a youth hostel or budget hotel
