where do i start the whole hotel does not have phone reception literally i expressed i had to call my childminder allot and no phone reception in all of the hotel you have to wait outside for phone calls second they will not take a cash deposit for the minibar so you aren t allowed to access it without paying by card rediculous i offered them pounds cash the food is disgusting and overpriced for some scrambled egg and a coffee to the room
