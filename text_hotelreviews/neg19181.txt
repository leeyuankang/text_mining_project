grange st paul is stars hotel but the service is far from being what you would expect the rooms are big and very comfortable but half of the rooms those of the inner court which are nice do not have cellular coverage this was told to us by the night manager which is very strange as this hotel is in the city of london mainly for business customers value for money was good as at the end of august the rates were not high for london location is ok if you want to be around the city like visiting the tate modern which is a great building and see the royal stock exchange but it takes time to get to the main tourist attractions of london as i wrote the service is almost not there unfortunately i broke one evening a teeth and had to go to an emergency dental care the hotel does not have a list of medical doctors and emergency dental doctors although this is a big hotel part of a london s hotels chain even in a small stars hotel in oban in northern scotland they do have dental care list the concierge does help with printing airline tickets and this kind of service but the whole stuff lack even the minimum kindness of a hotel
