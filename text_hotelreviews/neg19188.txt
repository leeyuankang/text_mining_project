the staff could have been friendlier and more helpful in their service and approach i asked for a room with a view and got a brick wall literally air conditioning wasn t working properly the tv was on a fixed stand so unable to watch it while getting ready or in bed i think you are missing an opportunity with the roof top bar needs some tlc and more drink options cocktails would help we didn t realise on booking it that the location wasn t great no nearby restaurant s or bars
