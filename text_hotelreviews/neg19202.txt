bed extremely hard and uncomfortable no complementary water only offered to regulars even though i have stayed here atleast half a dozen times room decor is also extremely dated and what is expected of a star hotel television very small and not easiest to view from the bed lastly not all staff have a great grasp of english which should be unheard of in a star establishment
