generator noise made it hard to sleep heard other guests complaining too at check out it took more than mins to get on the elevator at check out time couldn t use stairs as had a pram luggage front desk person on checkout was not very pleasant at all breakfast food was reasonable but had to hunt down a server to get some coffee and our plates were not cleared at any stage very unclear whether breakfast was included was told it was on check in and on the first day of our visit at breakfast there was no problem and then when at the entry on the second day we were told we would have to pay went to cafe rouge next door which was nicer anyway
