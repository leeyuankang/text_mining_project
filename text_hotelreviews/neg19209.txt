room allocations were muddled up after having checked in at and as agreed with hotel by e mail we could leave our bags and told room would be available when returning that evening when we returned our room had been allocated to someone else the replacement room bedding had to be changed as it was dirty and this all took time we were promised contact after we left but have heard nothing and we have stayed here before so even more disappointed with the service we received
