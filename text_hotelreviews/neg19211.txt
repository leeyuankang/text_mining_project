the lighting was quite poor in the room by the full length mirror it was very dark felt like the full length window which over looked offices allowed them all to look into the room i didn t want to pull curtains because it was the brightest part of the room but felt like we were on show would have loved the option of a view would have been better to have had a o clock check out instead of earlier training staff were left to their own devises could see she was struggling and her colleague watched on and ignored her with out any help left disappointed
