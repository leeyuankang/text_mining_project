my room has telephone reception so i couldn t receive or make any calls on my mobile through the stay i also booked the airport transfer at the hotel minutes after the scheduled departure time i was told that the driving was not coming for some reason the hotel asked a black cab to take me to the airport for pounds i ended up paying pounds as i didn t want the cab driver to suffer any loss
