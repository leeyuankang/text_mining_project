the room looked clean at first but on a closer notice there were glass marks on the table and spots around the toilet the room service didn t really cleaned but only rearranged the sheets and got new towels the room design looked cool and flashy on first sight but the bath and toilet were in one space with no tight door towards the bedroom just a bulky wall piece to close with a magnet lock for a person room it was very inconvenient to hear and smell what happened in the toilet the shower was large but without proper tilt to the drain the water flooded the whole bathroom each time someone took a shower the sink was placed in the middle of a wooden table nice optics but you could see the recurring contact with the water from the shower damaged the legs which wasn t very pleasing to look at the rooms were very poor isolated from each other you could hear everything your neighbor did particularly the slamming of the magnet lock of the bedroom door the windows were only very narrow to open natural light or air was scarce air conditioning was very loud but otherwise functional the hotel floor was sometimes dirty especially around the elevators and smelled occasionally
