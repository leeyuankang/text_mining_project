i highly recommend the larger rooms we were offered an upgrade when we arrived a larger room that was ready at am and we jumped at the chance their large rooms are positively luxurious our room was on a high floor away from the elevator on the back of the hotel and it was quiet but the location is as buzzy as it gets for london
