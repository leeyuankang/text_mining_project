rooms are very small probably ideal for a singleton or cosy couple but i guess that s the charm of london i would love to smell a candle that was for sale in the room before buying it maybe you could offer a mini sample in the room matchbox no mini danish pastries at breakfast buffet only regular size croissants and pain au chocolat available i would love something tiny to bite into with your coffee something small with lovely marmolade in or a fruit conserve etc i received a phone call at from reception concierge asking questions about the room etc i was actually asleep jet lag only arrived from dubai so i found it disturbing then someone was knocking at the door i don t think that was necessary receptionist apologized for this misconduct in the morning itv player catch up tv didn t work and other channels were loading for a long time i am sure its not hotel s fault but worth checking connections etc minor hiccups didn t spoil our overall experience though we love this hotel and have been returning at least once a year whenever in london
