on arrival walking into the hotel with the euro football on the dead flowers in the floral display at reception and the cigarette ends on the floor in the outside bit as we made our way to our room immediately made my heart sink the dead flowers and cigarette ends had been removed by the morning but as a first impression it made me feel disappointed as this was our wedding anniversary and it didn t feel very we d also had a complimentary upgrade to a room that had disabled facilities the receptionist said the room only had a lower sink and more space in fact the bathroom also had a disabled shower seat and hand rails here and by the toilet which if truth be told made us feel old and was an instant romance damper on our first weekend away without the kids in years so beware of upgrades also we were on the floor and the lift temperamental and painfully slow at times so we opted for the stairs more than once
