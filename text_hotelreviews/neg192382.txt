this is a very expensive hotel per night the actual hotel is not of the standard charged the hotel interior is quite dirty public areas very dirty in parts but hidden by mood lighting the window blinds the and room main lighting were not working room too small couldn t easily walk around the bed which if you have get up in the night is a problem breakfast very basic not matching the standard the hotel purports to be no in room hot drinks facility yes you may call for a tea in the morning but again expensive room service for a warm tea virtually every thing in the room is for sale seems more like a gift shop than a relaxing hotel room
