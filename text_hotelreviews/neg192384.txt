we stayed in room the bathroom was for a disabled traveller as had rails no bath and had a large shower room with a powerful shower that pointed at the shower door the shower door was not sealed and the water ran out at a great rate on to the floor of the bathroom getting all my clothes really wet we needed to use towels to soak it up the basin was a joke the tap just went over the edge of the basin bowl so you could not wash your hands completely just your fingers really poor design and function when we complained and asked for a new set of towels i felt it was brushed off as a small issue this is not what i would expect from this standard of hotel in london
