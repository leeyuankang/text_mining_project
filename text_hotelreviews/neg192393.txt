i was unable to turn the air conditioning off and although it was a very low noise i was still able to hear it why do so many hotels have the volume set so high when you turn the television on mine was set to so each time i had to turn it down to so it was at a comfortable level to hear and i did not disturb the rest of the floor for a star hotel i normally expect to find a robe and slippers available but there were none
