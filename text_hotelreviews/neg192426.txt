most annoying thing was that we had opted for a deal that was supposedly best price guarantee however after booking through booking com i looked at the hotel s own website it was cheaper there and included breakfast overall this made a difference on a standard room of on a three night stay annoying and when tried to resolve this with the hotel was just made to feel uncomfortable and like an idiot for asking room was quite tight on space but what you would expect of london i felt like i was in a hermetically sealed box with no obvious way to amend the air conditioning oh to open a window bathroom water smelt very much like pond weed
