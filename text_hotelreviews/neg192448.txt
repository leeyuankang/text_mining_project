what made this a very problematic experience for me was that the hotel withdrew more from my account than the statement i had signed at check in had said they would leaving me with an overdrawn bank account and no way to buy anything for the last days of my trip i complained about this at check out and i was simply told they withdraw an extra night as a deposit and that while it was too bad i hadn t been informed of this at check in and that this had caused me trouble it was basically my tough luck this basically destroyed the final days of my trip and very nearly stranded me sans money or any place to stay and while i understand that this was probably in the terms and conditions and that i should ve read those more carefully i m just not used to having the wool pulled over my eyes when patronizing star hotels the staff failed to make all this clear and then they didn t care when that caused me a problem i will not be staying here again
