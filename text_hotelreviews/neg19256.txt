very busy pool not the hotel s fault but pool area felt small for the number of guests we asked if we could get a room early were told no as we already had an allocated room number which meant we had one of the nice rooms this is a secret according to the receptionist didn t really believe that and i m sure it was just the receptionist s way of getting us off her back true to form the room we got was small tiny twin beds one of which didn t look like it had been made as was all lumpy aside from a white sheet no other covers on the bed i have stayed in far better rooms at this hotel which is why i know to be disappointed standards seem to have fallen generally client facing hotel staff receptionist concierge spa staff are not overly friendly and often quite curt booking com overview of the hotel said it included a continental breakfast but at check in we were told no breakfast was included
