the view from the hotel room was the starbucks inside the hotel very bizarre as i have never experienced opening the blinds to see members of the public drinking their morning coffee before would have preferred an outside view the bath needed a larger shower screen as it tended to leak all over the bathroom floor the tv was small and located offset from the bed so was not ideal for viewing purposes
