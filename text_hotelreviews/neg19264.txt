one guest asked for small gift to be left in the couples bedroom which it wasn t the grooms sister in law was very upset lots of guests some were offered breakfast upgrade but i was told this meant moving to another building which i explained not good as i was responsible for getting the bridesmaids into their dresses yet it was attached so would not have been a problem if it had been explained properly the bridal suite was not cleaned at all very bad service
