when i checked in my room i was shocked to see that the garbage bin was not emptied and to add insult to injury it has condoms thrown in it i was really devasted then i took a shower and was surprised that the toilet seat plastic cover was also not well cleaned and had some kind of smudges on it the last problem was the shower towel that had a brown spot the size of a quarter on it that i am not sure if it is dirt or something else the staff were very responsive to what happened and apologized and the even deducted some money from my charges not the whole night for free though and they all properly apologized but i paid more than per night i expect better hygiene the bed was very uncomfortable because it was a big bed but made from small mattresses put next to each other so you would spend most of the night sleeping in the crevice between both mattresses
