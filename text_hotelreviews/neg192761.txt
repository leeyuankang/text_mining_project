the rooms were not set up for the number of people staying in them had to request extra glasses cups etc and also for beds to be made up one of the reasons we selected this hotel was for the top floor restaurant disappointed to be told that it was open for corporate use only ground floor restaurant was also closed on one of the nights as there was a small private gathering ate elsewhere so hotel lost the benefit of our custom bar was very lively but loud regarding car parking we were given info on car parks about miles away from hotel took us longer looking for these than it did travelling down from shrewsbury when we did find them one was closed and the other two did not have access for high sided vehicles fortunately a member of our party managed to locate a car park yards from hotel which was very reasonably priced hopefully hotel have taken this on board
