the trendy glass bathroom wall was terrible because when someone went to the bathroom in the night the whole bedroom was lit up like a christmas tree breakfast i hated the coffee machine always big queue and it often needed attention from the staff unfortunately it is located on the other side of the room from where the staff are located coffee not good restaurant in the evening staff nice but too few of them check in we had a new employee who took seriously minutes to check us in i don t blame her the supervisor left her and therefore us out to dry
