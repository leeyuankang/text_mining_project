the beds are not good as in bad we asked to have collapsed mattress changed out instead they moved us to a different room with an equally poor mattress this time with a mattress topper was provided in addition to the mattress so we stood the mattress against the wall and comfortably slept on the topper for the rest of our stay couch cots in rooms are very comfortable manager explained that the current mattresses have been there for three years and a hotel can only change them every five years or they ll lose money in short wait another two years to stay here or stay on the couch in a pinch
