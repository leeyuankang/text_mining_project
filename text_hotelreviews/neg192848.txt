the mattress is old and so soft that it wasn t comfy at all we had to ask everyday for more shower gel and towels we expect more for an executive room at pounds a night also absolutely no organization for breakfast you have to queue for so long as there are free tables but the three staff there were wiping off tables carrying the cups one by one at this rythme we were not about to eat and this everyday as we stayed days also toilet paper feels cheap and not soft at all this is certainly not a stars hotel
