the hotel was undertaking a renovation in the bar and restaurant we were asked to move three times during our lunch so that the builders could do their work i wouldn t have minded that but my lunch a sandwich was poor and made with cheap white bread the place smelt of paint then the staff had a staff meeting and i got the whole training experience i asked to move to a quieter spot as my colleague and i had a meeting to prepare for we were told in no uncertain terms that it wasn t possible i did complain about all the disruption and again the bar man didn t really seem to care the service was slow and all of them looked like they didnt want to be there i also complained on check out and there was no real apology the staff overall weren t the friendliest and i would definitely stay elsewhere next time
