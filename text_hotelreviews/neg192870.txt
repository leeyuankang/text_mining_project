i only have two issues that are v picky the wall that separates the bathroom from the bedroom is a glass wall that you click a button to tint which is uber cool but if anyone needs to use the bathroom in the middle of the night the light illuminates the entire bedroom the other problem was that the pool was freezing with a capital f like i said picky but worth knowing it wouldn t stop me from booking again
