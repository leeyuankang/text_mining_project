unfortunately i didn t receive the butter i ordered for my breakfast however i m more than sure if i hadn t let my own personal anxiety to pick up the phone get in the way the staff there would have been more than happy to supply me my bad if i was to be harsh a couple of things would be to have different furniture in the room for those who want to take in the view from windows if you have a room with a view that is and a tv guide for the rooms tv might have had one but i couldn t find it however i did get a tv guide on my ipad using the hotels super fast wifi so no biggie
