compared to other star hotels we felt this was poor it was more expensive that i would usually pay but we haven t had a holiday for a while so were taking a couple of extra days after my work conference and wanted something a bit special the room we stayed in seemed tired and dull the pillows were not very nice or comfortable and the shower leaked through the doors there was not any complimentary water which would have been nice and seems usual in other hotels we assume we paid for location and peace rather than anything else
