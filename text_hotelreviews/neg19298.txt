there is no phone signal in the rooms and the wifi is appalling makes this place useless for business trips the beds are incredibly uncomfortable and they provide only one firmness of pillow soft even when you ask for firm pillows they send only soft pillows the concierge is the least flexible i ve ever come across around i asked the concierge to wash two shirts for me for the morning and they refused because i d missed the cut off the interior facing windows are novel but offer little privacy so once you get over the novelty of seeing into other people s room it s really quite irritating having your curtains closed the entire time the price was ridiculous night for an exec room when the only difference between that and the superior was a sofa rather than a single seat chair having paid an extra night for the ritz a few weeks prior i m struggling to understand how the grange can justify the minimal price difference this is far from a hotel and i would not recommend this place to anyone
