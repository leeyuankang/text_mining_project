there was nothing that we disliked at all as far as my little neutral face rating for the view goes if you re hoping to get a beautiful view of paris from your window you re not going to get one from most hotels in this arrondisement unless you pick one on one of the major thoroughfares like the rue de la fayette the largest street by our hotel in which case you trade off a decent view for road noise but from the arrondisement it s not like you re going to be seeing the seine or sacre couer or anything like that we actually requested a room away from a main road because we prefer it quiet so our window just looked out on the quiet little rue de trevise
