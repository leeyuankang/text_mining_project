it was very expensive we knew that when we booked but i expected a bit more housekeeping did not remove empty glasses cold coffee cups from our room there was no tea making facilities in the room just a nespresso machine i had to ask for our toiletries to be replenished as they left one small bottle of each for two people for days the staff seemed bored and the hotel appeared empty it was soulless not a place for families far more geared up for the business clientele next time we go to london we will stay in the centre and try and find a hotel with some character
