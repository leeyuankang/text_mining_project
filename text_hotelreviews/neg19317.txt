unqualified receptionist who booked us in did not check details and she tried to take payment on credit card a second time even though we said we would pay cash also do not like that they hold a payment on your card for at least days after you have settled the bill in cash the view from our bedroom was a brick wall the corridors are extremely hot the hotel bar appears to allow anyone and everyone to enter for an apparently star hotel the client le is far from that and the bar was very busy and very noisy at no complimentary water in our room we had to go to a local m s to get some the bathroom was quite small
