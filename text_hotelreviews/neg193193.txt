the hotel is really tricky to find and there is no point typing the postcode in a sat nav as it doesn t work best advice would be to ring the hotel and ask them to direct you they clearly get asked this question a lot so are quite good at it the other thing i found unusual is without advising me they took off my card just in case we used any extras we didn t so then had to wait days for the money to go back on my card not the end of the world just an annoyance
