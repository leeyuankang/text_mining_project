food and drinks at the hotel are very expensive unfortunately there were where our room was missed from the cleaning list and not because we d put the do not disturb sign up it was unexpected and unpleasant at the end of the day to get back and have to sort it out with housekeeping staff in the evening also we were overcharged by approximately for extra papers and mini drink bar items which we never had when we raised this with reception staff they were pleasant and apologetic in making a full refund but it made me wonder how many people are caught out by not checking the bill
