the rooms are very small and the bathroom is even smaller though it is very clean and updated the staff was extremely helpful and the doormen are terrific the nightly chocolate and cookies are a nice treat the hotel is in a great safe location just a minute walk to the bond st tube stop terrific italian restaurants just around the corner and lots of local pubs and shopping
