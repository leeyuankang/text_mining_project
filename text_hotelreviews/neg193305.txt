the room was a standard european twin room it was very compact and hard to walk between the bed and the desk i always hit my shoulder on the tv that was mounted on the wall so the value for the room was quite low for such a small room my room faced the roof of the building below with a view of the air handlers and a little bit of sky i had requested a nicer room and none was available i had also requested a pm checkin and the room was not available untile during which time i was nicely treated to a free cup of cappuchino the bathroom was very very small and needed some minor repairs as there was water damage to the floor boards around the tub and the sink granite top was splitting the gym is a private facility chain called the third space and the entry is complimentary since is is in the hotel building although the gym was superb it was very very crowded between and basically the entire gym was crowded with trainers working or in small groups i am a u s national figure skating champion and highly athletic and was made to feel unwelcome during peak hours basically the trainers glare at you like you are in the way you have to be very assertive to find a free space and stake your claim to it otherwise there were about trainers at any one time there should be some limit on how many trainers can be monopolizing the entire gym during a set period obviously there were people using the gym from the hotel and without a trainer and it was very hard for us to find a piece of equipment or room available the hotel should list the times for the group classes so hotel guest don t bother showing up then since i was only able to use the ballet room and ceiling cables with bars in late afternoon or evenings
