the size of the room was very disappointing it would have been fine for the bathroom was especially small and the extractor fan didn t work as a result the room smelled of stale water and when we showered the room was then full of steam given the temperatures outside during our visit this led to a very unpleasant experience i did alert the reception staff but the problem wasn t rectified i would have expected at the very least a response from them and maybe even another room i sometimes think that unless you book direct with hotels you are allocated inferior rooms and that complaints etc are not at the top of their list the first night thursday was very expensive for what we got not value for money
