to start off with the room was very small but considering the price for london it was acceptable the room was basically falling apart the window rim was lifted off so you can see the inside of the walls the bathroom had a leaking problem and water was drilling from the gap between the light and the ceiling i was transferred to a smaller room for one night all bedsheets and pillow cases had weird stains or black marks on them also the towels were dry and old you can tell they ve reused them for a longtime the food from brassiere is very average and they charge a tray charge which i haven t seen at any other hotels i ve stayed at if you don t hang the do not disturb sign and lock your door there will be staff knocking every mins sometimes i open the door and they just say sorry and leave overall you should spend a little more for a better hotel i would say this one is a three star level by my standards
