the bathroom was too small for two people overall the hotel was excellent the thing that most let it down was the restaurant food okay but waiting staff not great service took too long and although had booked room only as wanted to have freedom in terms of breakfast choice venue when using the restaurant the constant reminder of not having a package coupled with long delays was a little annoying to say the least
