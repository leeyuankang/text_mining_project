be weary of the construction at the back of the hotel which seems to start at a m every day including saturdays the windows provide zero insulation to the outside noise and so unless you prefer relaxing in your room to a symphony of jackhammers stay elsewhere the senior staff could do with a refresher on treating customer complaints too i arrived at p m and being told the room wasn t quite ready left to explore the area in return i was given a smallish room in the back of the hotel the only reason i checked in for the night was so that i could get some sleep prior to travelling the whole of the following day so i was understandably perturbed and having been woken at a m i called to speak to the manager who rather unhelpfully informed me that she can t control what happens outside granted but the hotel can very much control what happens inside and given the noise has clearly been an issue on that side of the hotel for other guests i would have expected to either have been told about the noise in advance or offered an upgrade which i would gladly have paid for had i known the premium the hotel places on a full night s sleep a discount on the room rate and a late offer to swap rooms was sadly too little too late
