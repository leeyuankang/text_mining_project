the staff at breakfast were flustered and too busy to be attentive they failed to wipe the table next to us of the previous diners crumbs despite two requests by the next occupants and it was hard to get their attention to remind them of things that were forgotten they were however very courteous and friendly and it should be pointed out that we were seated at a very busy time
