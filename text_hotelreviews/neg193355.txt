the first room we were put in was tiny and nothing like the pictures we then ask to move and we were given a room that was two single beds pushed together and was extremely uncomfortable we had two really bad nights sleep it was made worse as we were put on the floor when we had asked for a higher floor because you can hear so much noise coming from the brasserie bar in hotel and also the other bars just outside the hotel the breaskfast was completely over priced for what it was
