my wife has been seriously ill for over a year we had to travel to london at short notice for her to receive urgent treatment at am on the day of us leaving the hotel so our stay at the hotel was short i ve got to say that the hotel was very clean and of modern design but for some reason known best to the hotel staff we were allocated a ridiculously small and extremely uncomfortable room number we felt as though the hotel had taken advantage we will never stay there again
