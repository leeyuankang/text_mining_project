the hotel and swimming pool felt a bit overcrowded yes we stayed on a discounted rate for the room but it didn t appear a good value for money we ordered breakfast in and not only the order was mixed up two lattes came lukewarm and pastries tasted like leftovers from yesterday when complained desk staff was helpless manager unavailable promised to call me back never did overall left a bitter taste of the whole stay i would never stay again and would not recommend to a friend there are plenty of other really good hotels in london with similarly good locations but better service
