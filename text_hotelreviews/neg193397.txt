i picked this hotel specifically above others and paid more for it as it had a pool available i swim everyday when i got there the pool was out of commission there was no indication on the booking com website that the pool wouldn t be available and i received no update and the hotel said that it was mentioned on their website which was no use to me as i used booking com
