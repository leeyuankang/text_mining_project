the junior suite lacked something i consider essential namely a night table on either side of the bed there was only one night table so the second person had to put watch glasses phone etc on the floor as the bed was pretty high that meant getting out of it to reach for any of these things i talked to the reception manager who said she would look into it i hope so because i really like the hotel the bathroom was also not comfortable one had to actually get into the bath to open the bath water tap i will definitely try for a better room next time
