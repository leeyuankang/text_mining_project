just a couple of things that we were disappointed with firstly we had a deluxe suite and the room smelt musty and damp although it was probably the air conditioning unit the second thing was that my friend had scrambled egg for breakfast and there was a lot of egg shell in it she was offered a fruit juice as an apology but it should not have happened in the first place on the whole the hotel was great but just a couple of points to avoid future disappointment from customers
