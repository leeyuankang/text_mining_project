we arrived the hotel and got a room next to room under construction we where not informed while ordering the room and not during check in we came with years old baby and we all suffered from the noise and smell it is really not appropriate to offer a room without letting people know there are construction work that will continue during the weekend we did called the reception and they they were nice and understanding and even refund us for the baby bed but they didn t stop the work i tried to let my baby sleep with a horrible noise i don t think it is ok to charge fulll rate for a room in hotel that is under construction and eve not notify the costumer
