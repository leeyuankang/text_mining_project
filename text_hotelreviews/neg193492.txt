the room was small and dark outlook was inside of high building no ceiling lights just two table lamps and two tiny reading lights on the bed maybe two foot spare either side of bed no clock i like to do stretching exercises in the morning but no space here to do that the bathroom was small a trolley in there with towels etc took up space tiny space to dry yourself the thermostat for floor heating didn t work again not much lighting here small ceiling spotlights absolutely no good for putting your make up on no shaving magnifying mirror fixed shower over bath which was slippery the toilet roll holder is fixed on the wall the wrong way round so when you use the paper the roll falls off the holder the room wasn t very sound proof as i could clearly hear my neighbours moving around i did venture down to the gym pool to have a look you need key card to operate lift there twice i got stuck when the door wouldn t open so i had to press the button to another floor to me it looked as if this gym is used by outsiders not many hotel guests and was busy the pool was claustrophobic and so hot like walking into a sauna took your breath away i should have realised the mini bar was automated meaning when you lift a can up it registers on a computer i moved some cans to put some medication in the fridge so ended up with these items on my bill when i explained to reception what had happened they quickly rectified the matter
