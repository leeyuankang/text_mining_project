i have asked for a quiet room on separate visits the trip i was given directly opposite the elevators this trip was worse room was in a corner next to room service housekeeping the service stairs and service elevators and unsurprisingly noisy and did not feel private at all make sure you insist on a higher floor away from any elevators
