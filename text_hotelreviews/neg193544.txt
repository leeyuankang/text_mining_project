stayed here several times before i didn t like that the hotel didn t tell us in advance of close by building works they changed our room but it was actually worse woken both mornings by machinery only nights couldn t face moving a third time especially if it didn t improve the problem would have booked somewhere else on this occasion otherwise it s usually perfect here
