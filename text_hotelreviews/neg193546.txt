i really disliked the bathroom when we checked in we were told we got a complimentary upgrade but actually we were put in some strange room with a bathroom for disabled people the lighting was terrible there was no bath there was a shower curtain which i dislike passionately the shower was not very hot and very little water came out of it and overall the bathroom just looked cheap and uncomfortable not at all what you would expect at this price point
