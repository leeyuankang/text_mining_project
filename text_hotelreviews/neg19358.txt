they hosted a rave in the sports bar on our second night starting from till early morning keeping us both awake on level five not just us kept awake but many guests complaining and staff unable to get the party of people at this rave to turn the music down and no ability to get it closed down this was that loud on level five vibrations could be felt and base music heard and the dj shouting through his microphone paying to be kept awake is a novelty not likely to catch on we are awaiting a refund for that night still also the spa needs tlc and not very clean and a good idea to clean bath mats in the rooms occasionally
