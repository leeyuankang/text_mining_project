i would not describe this as a luxury star hotel the furniture in our room was of poor quality and partly broken the staff are stressed and often unfriendly partly because there are simply not enough of them we had to queue for minutes just to check in when we came back to our room on the second day at it still had not been cleaned getting a drink at the bar in the evenings also took a long time very disappointing for the price we paid i would espect a much higher standard
