the fact we booked a superior room and got an apartment room over the road and round the corner wasn t pleased as we wanted the experience in the hotel was in a room with a window but it was a skylight so that put a downer on our trip felt like we was just bunged into the worst room we was given complementary breakfast which was fine but only made it to one sitting so wasn t really bothered about having that as a sorry for putting u into our crappest room in the hotel
