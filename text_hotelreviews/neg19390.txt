as female friends travelling together we had booked a twin room but we were allocated a room with one kingsize bed no other twin rooms were available so a team was sent to convert our room as the king bed separates into two singles but they didn t do a thorough job one single bed was left with a kingsize mattress topper on it meaning it couldn t be made properly the other bed had no mattress topper at all was only roughly made bedside table left in the middle of the room phone left on the back of the sofa the room should have been converted and properly before we checked in which was late at night so there s no excuse for it not to have been done in time for our arrival
