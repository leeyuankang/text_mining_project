the view from our room was appalling it completely looked out onto office workers who could not help but see right into our room so we had no privacy or view whatsoever this resulted in us having to keep our curtains fully closed at all times which caused a somewhat claustrophobic feeling very sad at busy periods the lifts two would often be unattainable and you were kept waiting you sometimes could not get into them as they were small and so when busy they were full i could not find the stairs
