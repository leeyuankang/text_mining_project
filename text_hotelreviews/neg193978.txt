air conditioning difference between the bed room colder and the living room disappointed about the status of the elevator checking and some part broken iron mark on the floor torn hanger i was upgrading but when i book i choose specifically a single bed i did not want to have a coach for me not really confortable with the upgrade i got it we arrived at but the room was set up for only not enough towels even the coffee was free in the bed room we did not have enough capsule for peoples i came also for the spa we asked to the entrance how was the process they said that they will phone and come to pick up us in the bed room could have minutes delay after minutes delay i called and another person said to us that it was ready and we should go down in the discussion to order the spa i am pretty sure that glasses of champagne were included i was surprised to find on my facture the glasses to pay extra the jacuzzy was not set for peoples not confortable for the second one
