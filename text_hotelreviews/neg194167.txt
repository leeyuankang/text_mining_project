the hotel is situated in quite a run down location but still charge a premium price rooms were on the small side and even though it said i booked a king suite the bed was actually only a double the sheets were covered in hairs and fluff and also had a burn hole in stayed for two nights and bed sheets were not changed during our stay the room in general was ok smart enough looking but with a weird layout sink separate from the actual toilet bathroom staff were preoccupied with phones or friends but were nice curtains were broken and didn t actually shut fully or match toilet was very loud when flushing wouldn t stay again should be half the price they may think about staying again
