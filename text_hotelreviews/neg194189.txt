the man at reception was very unfriendly didn t seem to make an effort with us at all when we asked him questions regarding the room and other information he was not helpful and seemed arrogant he was very blunt and made us both feel very uncomfortable the bathroom was also not very clean i could see mould around the floor and tiles
