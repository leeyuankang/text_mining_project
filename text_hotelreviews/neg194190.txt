wi fi or electricity did not work after asking the receptionist when this would be resolved they were rude to me i was then called numerous times by the reception desk at around to be woken up and told it was the wrong number i am assuming because i had complained regarding the internet this is unacceptable behaviour it was intimidating and i felt uneasy and actually passively threatened throughout my stay here breakfast here was also an absolute joke
