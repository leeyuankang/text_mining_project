i thought the hotel lacked in every aspect from hospitality to basic cleanliness i can t think of one thing that would make me want to come and stay here again there s were stains on upholstery throughout the room from bed linen to curtains and the room in general looked very very different to the pictures i couldn t wait to check out in the morning
