the apartment was a little distance metres from the check in it was on the first floor with no lift and a quite narrow staircase there was a reasonable amount of living space but the bedroom was on the small side with a cm bed no bedside table no room and the door to the bathroom was barely cm wide and the shower cubicle also seemed to be the smallest available there was also only one mirror a good one but no electric socket nearby so to dry my hair i used the reflection on the high gloss kitchen units
