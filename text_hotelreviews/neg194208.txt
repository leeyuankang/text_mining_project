skip the restaurant downstairs for breakfast if you re in a hurry took ages to give my order there was only myself another guy in the place so it wasn t as if it was busy and then asked if i wanted tea or coffee giving the impression it came with the breakfast upon seeing my bill it turns out they d charged me for it it was crap coffee too it was only a couple of pounds but i felt a bit ripped off seems v busy in the eve s however so i guess the food then must be good
