i wasn t so keen on the noise from the fridge so had to turn it off i had paid for breakfast already but when i went to breakfast they had no bacon muslim facility which wasn t advertised no issues except was looking forwards to bacon i chose three other things off the menu and they hadn t got any of them the only thing they could offer me was beans on toast and that was the price of the breakfast i had already paid for online they make you pay per breakfast and if you paid already they let you pick stuff up to the value of what you have paid in any case it was an argument with the staff member to get my money back for breakfast he gave it eventually but at this point i had run out of time to go somewhere else before i had to go on my course
