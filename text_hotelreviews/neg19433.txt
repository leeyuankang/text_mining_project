didn t act like a star hotel the grange st paul s it s a place to get your head down no understanding of customer service which is a shame for a star hotel house keeping does not knock before entering the room so you get woken up by a stranger in your room internet although complementary keeps falling out in the rooms very annoying we went out an purchased local sims from that kept us connected late checkout charged at an hour really as opposed to we ll see if we can accommodate you like all other hotels do also in their policy is if you checkout after you will be charged for the full nights accommodation as opposed to a half day rate sounds like you are being robbed checkout is too early at should be general manager failed to show up despite two requests for him tv remote did not work despite reporting it no one came to fix it despite being here for over a week the slowest door opening in a lift try it it will drive you nuts london star hotels well none seemed to have got the memo compared to the rest of the world london has a lot of catching up to do maybe they should send their staff to asia and uae for pointers or just pickup a book on customer service and how to treat your guests overall disappointing the grange st paul s just doesn t get it and they are oblivious to that fact not the worst hotel but there is a lot of improvements can easily be made checked out of here and went to the conrad st james awesome so far they get it call them for some pointers
