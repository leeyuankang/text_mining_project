the rooms are small they are fine for people but people is difficult especially when the sofa bed is out there is no room there is not much wardrobe space either the bedroom is the bed with ft space all around coffee the property says it is start but they make you pay for coffee pods even star properties by the airport don t do that it is a pet peeve because i like my coffee in the morning also why put code pods for nespresso in the fridge the coffie comes out like warm from the machine beyond comprehension towels they don t seem to get it that people are in the room everyday they take away dirty towels and put back clean ones and everyday i have to go to the reception and ask for towels lighting the rooms are very dark lacking lighting at night luckily the windows are big so in the day you can see smoking the website says non smoking property and every night we come back the corridor filled with smoke from other rooms some of which gets into our room wifi the internet is fast but if you have business to do that uses services other than email and websites then you will have to use a vpn connection to get out they restrict the services allowed annoying but with vpn i was able to do what i needed
