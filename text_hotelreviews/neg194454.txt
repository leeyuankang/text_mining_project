the room was so small the bed was wall to wall climbing down the bed to get out an elderly person wouldn t manage it the living area was cramped we had a junior suite and if you put up the sofabed you wouldn t be able to move the staff said we had an upgrade we had asked to for a balcony on our booking but they said we couldn t have one the bathroom towels were like a runner on a table the toilet seat was broken the whole experience was disappointing and the pictures of the room on the website were so misleading
