the room was tiny and very dark with poor lighting the shower was tiny i am short and i am normal weight and i kept bumping myself against the shower door which did not stay well closed the shower was a tiny box the radiator in the bathroom got so hot you could burn yourself on it there was no space to put anything in the bathroom the bed was a single bed but i guess that is standard for europe when booking a single room
