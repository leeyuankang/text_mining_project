rooms are very small we stayed at bedroom apartment type there was no bedroom in one of rooms only the bed in a box type walls you feel like you sleep in a box we stayed days and they did not change the sheets at all not a once hotel workers are not helping to carry your luggages only the lady called olivia helped to bring our luggages to the room at the check in but at the check out olivia was not there thanks to her she is very helpfull they only watched how we struggle with the luggages also the day before we checked out i asked a man at the front desk can t remember his name to book a taxi and ask the total price to go consulate first and then airport he asked and tell us that taxi driver said it s euros he spoke in french so i could not understand we accepted next morning taxi driver came and asked that if we are going to airport we said no he didnt tell you we have to go consulate first ok we went airport finally and he charged us euros and he said is the only airport fee so i don t know who is the liar but my advice is do not book a taxi from hotel
