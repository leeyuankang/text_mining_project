this is really an observation rather than anything else the living space was on the small side so it s not really an apartment to hang out which is perfectly fine when you are using it as a base you should be out enjoying paris after all think of it more of a multi bedroom hotel suite than an apartment with the sofa bed in use the living room just disappears for us this was ok at that point we were just there to sleep we would definitely come back on a future trip to paris
