there wasn t any shampoo and shower gel given in the room and i went down to ask one of the staff said is in room and i said no and eventually he gave me a shampoo and a swop i just want to say i don t think a little shampoos and gel is not worth to much and also cleaner clean the room second day and still didn t give anything overall the price and quality doesn t match
