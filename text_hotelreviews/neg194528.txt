one of the advantages of a non serviced apartment should be that you are not disturbed by room service but we had the unpleasant experience of first being asked two times within minutes if we needed service and then after one knock on the door a staff member had planned to show our clearly occupied and private space to a group of about unknown visitors and here you can see one of our studios after we accepted his apologies later he again knocked on our door even with the dnd sign on it felt unsafe that unknown visitors were clearly allowed to visit our private space for commercial purposes
