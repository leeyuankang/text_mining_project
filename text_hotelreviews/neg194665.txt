i stayed nights and was bitten very badly from bed bugs since returning i am covered from head to foot in bed flee bites they are large hard red bites which are extremely itchy and unsightly and will last between weeks according to my doctor i called the hotel to advise them i stayed in room since i would not want other guests to suffer this when i asked to speak to the manager i was told they were on holiday no deputy manager available either so i simply had to relay my experience to a receptionist who did not offer any apology or seem bothered great location but i would not recommend you stay there since you will suffer for weeks afterwards to be avoided
