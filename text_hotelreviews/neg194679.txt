everything in the room was old and sort of run down it probably looked nice many years ago fabrics looks old the ceramic in the bathtub was wearing off and the handles are just so old the installations are not aesthetically appealing the spring mattress was also old and you could feel the springs reception is not the staff not very professional but nice there are lovely hotels in london for the same price unless you need to stay in this area or want a larger than usual room i would not recommend this hotel we did not have breakfast so i cannot comment on it
