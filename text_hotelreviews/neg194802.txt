i was robbed during my stay valuables stolen out of room amounting to management denies every responsibility eventhough no physical break in traces were found our room was the only one targeted rooms are not lockable from the exterior housekeeping reacted suspiciously after being asked if they had seen anything irregular hastily whispering after losing sight of us the hotel management argues that due to the key card reader not showing any suspicious key card movements they can not be held responsible eventhough the hotel staff uses physical keys to enter the door and therefore can not be tracked these hints support the assumption that the hotel staff had something to do with the burglary the management is not at all cooperative with handling the issue and keeps stating that as no traces were found they are relieved from every liability the reception even stated that these incidents happen on the regular not good once again i recommend to avoid this hotel
