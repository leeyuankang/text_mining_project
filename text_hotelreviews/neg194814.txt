i never ate breakfast at the hotel because i thought was a bit steep i thought that housekeeping was a little pushy although very thorough if i was in my room and they knocked and i said no thank you they continued to knock and would then call to see if i wanted service the most upsetting part was on my first night coming in late i was harassed and hit by a drunk man on the street outside of the hotel and the person working the desk was a jerk i was clearly distraught and trying to get in and he just stood there behind the desk stating st me then he defensively told me that the key card doesn t work after hours and you have to ring the bell i told him i was just assaluted out front and he didn t seem to care only that that s the policy of the hotel and they have to be safe it doesn t say that anywhere on the outside door so for the protection of safety and guests that needs to be handled differently
