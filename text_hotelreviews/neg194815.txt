i dont like how the hotel receptionist handled my concern first night i requested for a dental kit or tooth paste as we have our own toothbrushes with us but they couldnt help at all next day i bought my own toothpaste from the supermarket so i can brush my teeth after a long walk to see the rest of the attractions when i came back our room was cleaned but our toothbrushes were gone and no one can help us again very inconvenient and horrible experienced in a four star hotel like this
