room was dreadful i had to climb over the bed to get to the other side roof at a very awkward angle meant i couldn t stand up next to the bed i m bathroom very small booking com says room contains large double bed queen size however i am certain we were in a double booking com also says room is square feet not sure what they were measuring paid a reasonably high price for a very uncomfortable stay we were unable to open a window and airconditioner cannot be changed to blow cool air which meant we had only a few hours sleep each day as we kept waking up sweating used concierge to arrange airport transfer however upon checking back hours later found it had not been done
