we had the superior room on the floor which we felt was no different than the advertised standard room another couple we knew where staying in the same room type on the floor their room and bed was much bigger than ours our room had a shower over the bath which was awkward to get in and out off water pressure wasn t the best either no one ever seemed to be working in the hotel bar we where there for nights days and never seen one person at it
