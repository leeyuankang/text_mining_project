the air conditioner in our room didn t work it was comfortable with the window open so i didn t ask for help about this there was no hair conditioner provided in the bathroom we were supposed to get a queen size bed but instead it was twin beds next to each other with a king size bed sheet for the last days of our stay the beds started separating we laughed about it being the continental divide atlantic rift or even grand canyon maybe you could attach the twin beds with brackets or something to prevent this also maybe you could offer coffee in the lobby in addition to tea
