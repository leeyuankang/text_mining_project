as soon as we got into our room the bathroom door wouldn t shut the double bed i paid for was single mattresses that split apart as soon as we got into bed we asked for the bathroom door to be fixed but the maintenance guy just ripped up the tile and then the other tiles became cracked and dangerous our air conditioning was also broken and our first night sleep was awful as it was so hot also the hotel didn t tell me that they took a deposit as soon as i got there for the mini bar and things although we wernt going to use it thankfully they kindly upgraded us to a better room but it was still boiling hot every night and hard to sleep the beds were comfy which made it a little better
