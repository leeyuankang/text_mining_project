the whole point of booking this hotel was that we were travelling by car and i requested this hotel as it advertised of having a car park and it hasn t so apart from having to trek about with luggage you ll be hit with a a day parking fee additionally not good booking com plus the room was very small probably ok for a weekend but not much longer than that
