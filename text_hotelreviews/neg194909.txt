the room was too small for people the lift was broken during our stay and so we had to walk up and down flights of stairs there was a small person service lift but this was unusable we tried to buy a coffee at the breakfast bar in the morning but were not allowed as the girl said she only dealt with express breakfasts we booked the shuttle bus to airport would not recommend as it arrived late and you have to pick other guests at other hotels up on your way
