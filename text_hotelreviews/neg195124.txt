but the room is extremely small i had a single room for nights and was so small that was not even possible to totally open the luggage i think the room size will be around square meters with a small corridor at the entrance that actually makes the room even smaller there s one window but is like there s no window room also noisy because at the ground floor for a stars hotel and for the price almost pounds with no breakfast it s not worth it
