it took three tries for a borderline suitable room two were extremely hot air conditioners were not working properly the building is very londonesque however the rooms are extremely small we had to climb over each other to get to bed it touched the wall on three sides the bathroom is clean but dangerouly small getting in and out of the shower is scary
