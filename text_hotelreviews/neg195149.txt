staff were incompetent and provided no real service had no handle on who their guests were at one point we were asked how our stay was we arrived earlier and he checked us in room was scruffy and not what i d expect for a prince s square hotel in west london felt like it was updated ago and then they ve given up because you ll always be fully booked in that location finally and probably most importantly the bed was horrific so uncomfortable neither of us slept well for our entire stay
