the room was tiny very hot and claustrophobic entered down a narrow passage at the back of the hotel it was explained to me that the air con wasn t working before i saw the room i said i didn t mind and was offered free breakfast as compensation however if i slept with the window open there was a constant racket from some machine outside the room looked onto a light well the air wasn t fresh i felt trapped slept really badly and left at about well before any chance of a free breakfast i couldn t stand the room a moment longer the staff were all v kind but the room was horrendous
