the bathroom was terrible the sink was literally at the level of my knees and i m tall the toilet was incredibly old and there was only a shower i met a friend who was also staying at the hotel her room was smaller but was completely updated with a full normal bathroom my room booked as a deluxe double had no refrigerator the bathroom was terrible it was located at street level where anyone walking by could see into the room so i had to keep the drapes closed upon arrival to my room i noticed the air conditioner was blowing warm air i went to the front desk to let the manager know and hopefully send someone to investigate i was told they would bring me a fan it was hot and humid in the room i asked if they could move me to a room even a smaller room with working air conditioning and i was told no because i had already used the bathroom in the room i was in i guess they expect a guest to hold their water after a long flight and an hour ride by taxi from heathrow just in case they need to change rooms while discussing this with the gentleman at the front desk another guest began to express the same complaint his air conditioning was not working he wanted to be moved to a different room and also was told no he had the opportunity to check out and go to a different hotel i was stuck with this hot humid room because i had paid for the room back in march through booking com they offered no compensation not even a breakfast the next morning after a miserably hot night with a fan the air conditioning quit working completely the windows could not be opened to get fresh air i was stuck for the duration of my stay in this room that i had paid over a night for i noticed as i walked barefoot in the room that the bottom of feet were now black from the dirty carpet after that revelation i wore socks in that sweat box they called a deluxe double disgusting
