i had the worst experience in terms of comfort i have ever had in a hotel anywhere in the world the basement room they put me in had faulty ac so was like an oven when i complained they gave me a fan and said there was nothing else they could do it was late and i was extremely tired and had an early start so there was no way i could change hotels at that time i was told there was nowhere else to put me i did not sleep at all the heat was unbearable the next day when i complained i was then offered a cooler a mini ac unit which was not offered to me the night before when i asked to change rooms the manager came to see me and immediately apologised and agreed it was extremely hot and offered to change room the only room available i was told was a smaller room than the one i had paid for it was tiny but at least i could sleep
