i had the misfortune of staying at the property during a heat wave in london i was moved twice in those nights meaning staying in different rooms because of problems with the air con they never managed to fix the problems in any of the rooms during those days the staff tried to be polite and civil but were not very helpful apparently they were still in the process of learning to run a star business
