the room was claustrophobic i travel a lot but i haven t slept in such a small you can not call it a room shoe box under the earth before when i booked i had no idea that it will be under the earth to open the window was possible but you had a dirty wall in front of your face and no normal air circulation only the air from the air con if you need a submarine experience without fresh air stuck in a shoebox i can recommend the single rooms at ground flour
