i got a room on ground zero which i didn t like at first but it turned out to be fine it wasn t as nice as the room in the pictures but it was okay i did miss a small fridge though my only concern would be how to get out in an emergency like a fire there was only one way out from the ground floor up some quite narrow stairs
