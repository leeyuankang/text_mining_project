the reception staff weren t really nice to their own trainee when i checked in it seems roles and responsibilities weren t really clear and the tone was quite rude room is a tiny shoebox just enough to fit a single bed in it also looks out into some form of larger vent or something so opening the windows is probably not recommended i think the description of the room size should be more clear
