where to begin run don t walk away from this property i paid for a single deluxe room which i had read was ridiculously small fine for me since i am knowledgeable on the european hotel standards being much different than american ones i was offered a room so small and claustrophobic that you could not raise your arms to the side without touching the wall bathroom and shower were so small and there was not even a soap holder to hold your soap i had to open the shower door and place my soap and wash rag on the sink i hit my knee several times on the side table just to maneuver into the bed the icing on the cake though is the substandard a c at this property what i discovered was that you have to place your room key in the wall to turn on the lights and for the air conditioning to kick in room was so hot that you could not sleep when i told them at the desk they did switch me to a better upgraded room and they were very accommodating simple amenities like fresh ice needed to be requested at the front desk i will say that property is in a safe location though somewhat confusing to find because a lot of the hotel properties look alike management needs to honestly portray the rooms as they are as i feel very deceived since my original choice was the size of a dorm room with a view of an air duct for any business travelers who are only staying one night this hotel may be acceptable though for anyone wanting to enjoy your vacation and get a decent nights sleep this place is not for you
