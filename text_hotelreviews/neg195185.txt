my booking was described as one for a deluxe room i was allocated room which is wide by in length totalling sq yds of which the ensuite occupied sq yds the shower is ins by ins of the remaining sq yds most was occupied by the single bed bedside table single wardrobe and desk leaving very little room in which to erect the ironing board for admittedly twice the price the following night i had room at the st pancras renaissance hotel which was sq yds in size so the premier worked out more expensive per sq yd as opposed to the renaissance at per sq yd to summarise room was small and rather overpriced in comparison the tv was not tuned properly with missing and reception other channels snowy
