tiniest hotel room i ve ever stayed in no natural light window opened into dark air shaft tiny shower if you re a larger person you won t be able to squeeze through the shower door no face flannels i had to hunt for the hair dryer found it in the desk drawer only local channels on tv not a comfortable place to hang out during the day i basically used it as an over priced hostel
