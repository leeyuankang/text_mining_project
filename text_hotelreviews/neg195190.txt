i had to be shown bedrooms before the receptionist decided he could offer me a better room the first room was a ground floor room with two air handling units running either side of the window making a lot of noise the second room did not have any window at all i cannot sleep without an open window during this saga the receptionist kept telling me that the problem was that some of the guests had decided to over stay i said that having booked this room about a week before this issue was not one that was relevant he also stated a second problem i was staying only one night establishments are free to stipulate a minimum stay if one does not and this one did not they cannot penalise who are staying for one night by confining them to rooms that are unacceptable at this price night in my case after all this i was confronted with a mouse that appeared from under the dressing table the following morning one could not regard this as a good stay
