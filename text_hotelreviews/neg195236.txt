we asked the reception to order a taxi for us to pick us up at the hotel they ordered a private car chauffeur service instead it was pounds more expensive the driver was late i had to use my own phone to give info on postalcode for our destination in covent garden and that got us delayed another min since he didn t understand anything i said finally on our way we found out the fixed price of pounds he didn t have the credit card machine with him we only brought pound in cash since we knew the fare by regular taxi he wanted us to call his manager from our own phone to figure out what to do about payment we refused to do that he said he could stop at an atm and we could get out and get cash we refused since by now it was obvious we would not make our dinner reservation we were minutes late for our reservation that we made months ago and the reservation was cancelled main complaint here is the hoyle should not just order much more expensive chauffeur rides when i as a guest require a london taxi also we were given a room for the disabled unfortunately the room was only helpful to the disabled we did get another room on request the next day but on a night stay it s a hazzle to pack again and unpack
