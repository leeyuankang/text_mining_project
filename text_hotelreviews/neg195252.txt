the room was tiny and had no daylight when opening the covered windows there was an annoying noise when i asked for another room they offered me a room in the basement without window i accepted another room similar to the first dark and the noise generator air condition went on about every twenty minutes during the night i guess the room was ok for the price as the location is great i just imagined a little more comfort in a hotel staff at reception were friendly we did not have breakafst at the hotel as there are plenty of great cafes and restaurants nearby
