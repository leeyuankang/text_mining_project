my super small deluxe single room was situated in the basement and was accessible by super narrow corridors it felt just like being on some ship the room had a window but the glass was not fully transparent and of course it had no view whatsoever the air conditioning was blowing only very hot air and there was no way to adjust it other than calling to the reception so i kept it off the whole time the bathroom sink was not working from the very first moment i opened the tap and the water just didn t drain the shower tap was also leaking water both bathroom failures were fixed the other day when i complained also during the night outside unit for air conditioning could be heard turning on and off this kind of room absolutely does not deserve stars and this should be reviewed
