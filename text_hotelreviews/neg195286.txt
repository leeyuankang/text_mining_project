first of all we were asked to pay for our rooms when we checked in which for me is always an alarming sign as you can t see the room and check that everything is as described on the website before paying as it tuned out the pictures were much better than the reality then we were told when checking in that the heater was not switched on in the rooms of december and that if we wanted the room warmer we would need to call reception as they controlled the heating system from there of course the rooms were freezing cold and it turned out that the heating system was not working in out of of the rooms that we had rented and the maintenance person had to work on the system in these rooms to make it work while our room was ok yet extremely small my friends room were absolutely minuscule i have booked hotels many times in london and the double rooms they were given were the size of single rooms in other hotels the beds would have been fine for person but definitely not for people as the mattresses were probably of the lowest quality possible or old and had a curve in the centre making it impossible not to sleep on top of another the bathrooms were clean and were probably the only part of the experience close to deserving the stars rating all the little details were there to tick the boxes and make sure that this hotel gets rated stars samples of soap and shampoo hair dryer elevator etc however these details were of the lowest quality possible finally two of my friends could not sleep because of a noise which they thought was the tube and turned out to be a big pipe sending steam and vapours against their window when they mentioned it at reception they were told that they should have asked for ear plugs to conclude this place feels like a totally unloved hotel a place that would need a big refurbishment and some care to allow it a pleasant customers experience
