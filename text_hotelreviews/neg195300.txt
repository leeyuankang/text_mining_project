rooms and beds smaller than most wardrobes noisy extraction vents so close to the window you couldn t even open it room changed room for the second night room and was just the same for around per night i would expect to be able to walk around the bed not even enough space to open a case and get changed thoroughly disappointed and would advise everyone to book elsewhere plenty of other roomy hotels in the same location for less money
