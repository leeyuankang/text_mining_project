the room was supposed to be a deluxe double room but instead it was a dark tiny room with window view to a wall and limited sunlight it was so small that you could not walk around the bed and my wife had to climb over me to use the bathroom we had payed in advance and by mistake the receptionist charged us again we were cool with the situation as it was a simply mistake however we didn t liked the way the manager spoke to the poor girl we were also told by the receptionist that it was ok if we needed to extent the hour of our check out if needed but we were not allowed in the day after
