while we stayed for nights and on the third floor there was no elevator working the bathroom faucets were broken in the bathtub including drain shower rod kept falling down shower curtain had orange mildew on it the air conditioning was very loud we paid for a deluxe room and slept in a hard old double bed poor lighting only lit one side of room no view other than large rooftop ventilation system the pictures posted on your website did not come close to what we experienced this is definitely not a four star hotel by our experience
