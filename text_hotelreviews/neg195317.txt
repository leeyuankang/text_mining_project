it was somewhat chaotic at no point did your website tell us that a whole refurb of the reception area was taking place we checked in in a converted bedroom with a trainee woman who was slow and unable to communicate properly in english the room we were given was a single room with a double bed pushed against the window we couldn t walk around it and had no place even to change or unpack when i complained we were told that all rooms in london were small i reassured them that i stayed in london all the time and they weren t they changed our room to a basement with no window but it was bigger and we could at least open our cases they re well decorated and clean the outside of the hotel was dark and i actually fell on the bottom step onto the pavement because i was unable to see though thankfully only grazed but could have been much more serious more and more i feel that hotels in london especially at peak times just want to rip people off
