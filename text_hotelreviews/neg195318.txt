the services of the hotel it is undergoing renovation and they did not let us know ahead of time so you would here the workers all day long the services in the hotel are poor although they upgraded me to club room but rooms are too tiny barely fit the bed the floor makes too much noise and you can basically hear everything the lift broke down the first day we arrived and we stayed days and they still did not fix it so we had to go up and down floor everytime we wanted to go out and it is not very practical the room card had to always be checked after you have gone out as they deactivate when put near metro or credit cards first time i ever hear that
