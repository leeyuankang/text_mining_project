the rooms are tiny and not suitable for adults plus luggage the bed was comfortable though regardless of the facilities the staff is not qualified to handle any problems on the day of our arrival the elevator broke down and was broken for the entire stay we were a family of staying in rooms for days all situated on different floors second third and the fourth you can imagine the stairs we had to climb during the whole day there were construction work going on in the building so it was best to stay out for the whole day then the reception was moved into a room on the ground floor because of some construction work that was supposed to start after the weekend but hadn t started when we left all that fuss and confusion for nothing all our communication with the reception team was really awkward and they seemed to be in a hurry to do something else i take my hatt off though for the bell boy who had to carry all our luggage up and down the stairs the only thing we got out of them was we are sorry for the inconvenience we were not compensated in any way at all or were invited to move to a lower floor not even invited to have breakfast for free or something they didn t seem to care at all they even ordered us a cab that was way more expensive than a regular cab and smaller just go for a london cab with a meter not the ones they call
