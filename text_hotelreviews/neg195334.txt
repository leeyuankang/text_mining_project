the first night when we arrived at the hotel we were given the room the room is in the groundfloo at the back of the building the only window looks at the ventilation shaft m square wide the room does not have proper daily light and the curtains nor the window should not be opened if you do not want to stare at the dark hole of the shaft next door to the room are lavatories for the staff which were used squiking doors several times during the night the room was tiny i have never been in such an unsuitable space the hotel by renting this room is cheating turistis such a room should not exist let alone be rented for pound night disaster i never have been in such a space i can t even called it a room whan i asked for anothe room the answer was that the hotel was fool and that they will solve the problem in the morning mercifully next morning we were moved to a room on the first floor with normal daylight and window looking over the park the breakfast room is too small crampled and siuated in the basement the breakfast is poor i would strongly advised anyone not to even start thinking about visiting this hotel
