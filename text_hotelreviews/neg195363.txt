i got a single room first which was like a box room it was the smallest room i ve ever seen there should be a law about not being able to rent out such small rooms my suitcase took up most the floor space kept tripping over it window opened into some pipes i saw some animal walking around in the corner of my eye think it was a mouse but not sure had to ask to change this room as it was seriously unneceptable next room same size just looked bigger because of the layout it was a bit better but still tiny funny smell in both rooms some staff members grumpy and cold not uk standard place
