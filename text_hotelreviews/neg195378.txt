the room was advertised with a bath and we actually received a room with a shower that was too small to turn around in i struggled to wash my hair in there and felt extremely chlostraphoebic you also couldn t open the windows you can also hear every noise throughout the hotel so we didn t get a very good sleep my partner is just over and was hanging out of the bed all night
