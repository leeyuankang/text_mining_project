room seemed a lot smaller than advertised but did have all you need fridge in the room was a waste of space as it just took up room and did not work shower heads needed cleaning which was off putting and toiletries were of quite a poor standard the room was also very much like being on a ship the building is old and and you have to make allowances for this but the room had a definite slope which was so bad that we rolled off the bed if you have a cheap deal then its worth it but full price i would not pay or reccommend
