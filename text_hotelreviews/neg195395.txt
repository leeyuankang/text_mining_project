the room club room was much smaller than described here amenities are old and the overall cleaning is not good the elevator was not working half of the time of my stay at the time of checkout the personnel was trying to convince other clients to leave positive comments here and on tripadvisor which is probably the only reason why this hotel is featured on booking com would not recommend
