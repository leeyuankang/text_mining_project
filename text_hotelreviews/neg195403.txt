the room was smaller than we d expected it was still perfectly adequate though just don t expect wonders the floor was a bit creaky and the air conditioner made a weird loud noise every now and then that woke us up a couple of times the complimentary hotel shampoo is terrible bring your own but really it s perfectly alright the staff is nice they will keep your bags for you on the day or arrival and when you leave the bed is soft there is air conditioning even if it s noisy it s clean quiet located very conveniently and notting hill is lovely
