the hotel was over booked and had no room for me so when i got to the hotel i was asked to wait for a taxi that would take me to a sister hotel supposedly an upgraded one however in that hotel i was located in the basement in a stuffy room closet actually with no window this type of room should not be offered in such a high price i asked the reception to change my room but they claimed to have nothing for the night the next night i was given a room above ground level and it was very nice indeed just wish i had this room from the get go which honestly i believe i should have how can they charge for a room underground with no windows and air circulation the same as they do for their other rooms makes no sense to me the way i see it this hotel is a gamble
