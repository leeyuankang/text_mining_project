this hotel was probaly the worst i ve ever been in the staff were horrible except porter the room wasn t to high standards and we were lied to we ordered a deluxe twin room and they first placed us into a standard room we then complained about this first saying they didn t have another room then swapping us with another person which is so dishonest we think that this is what they did to our first room as we were given smoking rooms when we ordered non smoking swapping people around is so dishonest aswell as upgrading people that payed less then degrading those who payed for the deluxe room i barely slepped at all not even sleeping the first night due to the noise of people in the corridor and the lift the twin beds may as well have been double beds as they are not separated they just put on two twin beds on a double base the cleanliness was terrible and they obviously do not dust at all the shower was extremely dirty aswell made our stay at london a nightmare
