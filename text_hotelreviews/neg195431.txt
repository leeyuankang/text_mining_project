extremely disappointed with my stay firstly i was rung midmorning of my arrival date to be told i was being relocated to another property then after an hour of phone calls en route whilst on the train to london found i could in fact stay at the hotel despite the maintenance issues that were occurring having had to press for this information firmly and repeatedly i also had to ask for an address and name of the hotel as i could not find it on google worrying to say the least and a little stressful booking com were not very helpful either i d booked this hotel months ago and of course it would be impossible in london to find an alternative accommodation in the vicinity i required at just under for the night perviously they have been great on arrival i was put in a room which could have been considered a closet with a window onto an industrial vent the heat was unbearable and after calling down to reception and growing impatient hailing some porters i saw in the hallway still running late to get to the business event purpose of my trip i was moved to another room and due to time restrains had to just agree to it the furniture was in a deplorable state broken and chipped the shower was dirty with orange scum on the grout and limescale on the head the mirror was cracked down the middle but at least this room had a window albeit onto the back of other properties and having to open and close doors of he wardrobe bathroom to navigate to it later i asked to book a taxi and only on almost arriving at my destination the firm they d used not knowing how to get there i was on the gps on my phone was charged a fare that was more than the going rate for a hackney cab something i thought i was ordering instead of a private firm apparently this rate had been agreed prior to my departure why they didn t tell me this i have no idea
