the room so small low ceiling no room for anything the room was so hot and the air conditioner would only go as low as degs and when i switched it on it smelt of damp air and made alot of noise the bathroom just was not clean enough there was stains on the t roll and the shower was stained the light switch for te bathroom was covered in finger marks it was quite horrible no minibar for water or other drinks the lift was so slow it was just unpleasant to stay in and i woudl not stay there again i don t know why it has a star rating it should be star as it really as nothing but it s location to give it any kind of attraction for staying there
