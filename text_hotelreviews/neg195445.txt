it s not so much of a dislike but one thing i would point out is that the air conditioning seemed to lack power and the instant cold zap expected from air con but we were lucky to have glorious weather which meant the room was very hot anyway so we kept the air con on all the time with a nectar card and it did help to keep it cooler and more comfortable for when we were in the room
