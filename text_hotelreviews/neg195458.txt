the first room i had was tiny it was so hot i felt i couldn t breath air conditioning noisy you couldn t open curtains i assume because window opened onto two huge pipes i asked to move rooms was moved to a double room which was equally tiny but had a view the pictures of the rooms on the website do not reflect the actual rooms a very disappointing and expensive stay for the room
