although i booked two months in advance i was moved from this hotel to two other hotels on the same day with a couple of hours prior notice the hotels are kind of similar to each other however when i choose a hotel online i expect to spend the night in it and not be bothered with moving from one hotel to the other because the booking system they have is incompetent although there is an elevator there are some rooms with an extra set of steps
