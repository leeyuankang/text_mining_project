i was asked to move to another hotel hrs before my arrival because the boiler was out of action when i arrived non of the staff seem to know anything about it which i found a little suspicious the deluxe twin was not as pictured online and the room was very very snug the view was looking out on to ductwork of an extract unit that was constantly running
