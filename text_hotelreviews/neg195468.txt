toilet seat not even attached to the toilet which should have been spotted when the room was cleaned the tv was very old and the picture quality was appalling like watching one from the s the shower tray was quite grubby and the shower had no pressure these are all pretty basic things that you would expect i was very disappointed as i wanted my son to stay in a nice hotel with me
