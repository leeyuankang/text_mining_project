we got bumped from this hotel to the hyde park grand in paddington on what i am sure was the pretext of a boiler problem we were assure it was a better hotel and it would be an upgrade we were offered a free breakfast for the inconvenience we had to check in at the notting hill hotel paid and were sent by taxi to the hyde park grand we were given a basement room that was so small that we could not both be vertical at the same time one had to go in the bathroom the room was tired and it was not a good experience we did not risk the free breakfast
