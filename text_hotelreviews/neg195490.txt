staff was very rude upon check in the receptionist was not able to find my booking even though i provided her literary having written them on a piece of paper and handed it to her my reference number and name under which the booking was made different from guest s name she kept me waiting while calling housekeeping to deal with a room move for a different guest finally when suitable for her she got back to me and having provided again all the details she had the courage to say i haven t done it before really too much on top of this even though my daughter had requested a nice quiet room possibly on high floor at the time of the booking i was checked in a too tiny room on the first floor facing a wall cherry on the top when needed to request something more than once reception staff was looking at their mobiles watching funny video or minding their own business
