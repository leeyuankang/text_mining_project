i don t believe the room was in par with the price the room it s self was ok however the bed was too small my feet hung over the edge and i m only n my partner is over our room was situated on the ground floor next to the public toilets which kept us up most of the night with people going to the toilets and the cleaners filling up there buckets in the morning there was also no view and we couldn t open the window as it looked out onto the vents for the kitchen
