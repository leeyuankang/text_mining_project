they ask you to pay immediately i personally don t like this cause i wanna see the room first and then pay if everything is ok the room is really small nothing to do with the pictures showed on booking i told at the reception and the answer was it s booking fault cause to sell more they put these pics the furnitures are like in the pictures but the size is totally different for person and night it should be ok but personally if i were with someone else i would have complained i said that also at the reception cause it can t be considered for a bed stuck under the window and between the walls that oblige of the sleeping in to step over the other one to go out of the bed this is more a nice single room the floor in the bathroom was broken and for a star hotel this is not a little thing as also the toilet had the sit broken the window was really old and quite creepy and i couldn t open it for more than cm cause then it s blocked in the bathroom no windows so the standard is really more of a vintage star hotel clean and nicely furnished but i wouldn t consider this as a stars hotel in london they should start to understand that in the standards in all europe are really different and i have personally been in some stars hotels or budget hotels that are nicer than this one new more space more facilities for the same price or even less but unfortunately london is still the most expensive city with mediocre standards
