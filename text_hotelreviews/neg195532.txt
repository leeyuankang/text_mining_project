the only negative i can say about my stay at this hotel was i had a ground floor room which basically had no exterior view it looked onto a generator of some kind also the room was on the small side so if you like a bigger room this hotel might not be best for you to be fair i only wanted the room to put my head after a work night out in london so i didn t mind at all plus i d rather have a small quality room than a massive lower quality room the only qualm i do have is the temperature of the room i couldn t quite work out how to use the air con so i was a tad chilly in the night but felt warm by the morning
