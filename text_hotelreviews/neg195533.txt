this hotel took a sum of from my bank account the night before i was due to stay with them i phoned the morning of my flight to query same and was told there was a hold put on this amount and once i paid on check in this money would be released i was then advised that there were maintenance issues with our room and so we would have to move to the london premier kensington hotel upon checking in i went to pay the bill in total with a different card only to be told i couldn t a manager eventually came to our assistance and took the total amount from the second card and told me they would ring the bank to release the hold on the on the original account it is four days later and i am yet to receive this money back into my account despite having paid the bill in full on the second card the girl on the front desk called us a complimentary taxi and asked him to bring us to the park hotel which he duly did we were checked in there by a staff member and sent to a room in a different building across the road from the hotel this building did not have any access to wifi which was one of the reasons that we booked the notting hill hotel this was very inconvenient for my travel partner and i the water in the shower was cold and when i went to bring this to the attention of a staff member at the park hotel i was told we had been checked into the wrong hotel but why was this not communicated to me when i was being checked in there this whole hotel group appears to be in chaos and i would most certainly not recommend any of the hotels which i had dealings with nor would i stay here again have a look at the terrible ratings on tripadvisor and you will see that i am not the first one to have had this experience
