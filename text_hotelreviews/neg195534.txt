i arrived in the afternoon and the reception area was full of people reception was a bit overwhelmed and told me it would take a while until it would be my turn to checkin so i stayed a little bit but then offered to leave my things there with them and go to the city to tour and have dinner and come back a while later which they seemed very happy about coming back around i was told they gave my room away to someone else so i had to be brought by taxi to another hotel where the staff was friendlier and could give me a room the man dealing with me at night was unbelievably unfriendly und unhelpful and didn t listen to a word i was saying of my nights per month are in hotels around the world but in years this is the first time this has happened to me i was very unhappy about it
