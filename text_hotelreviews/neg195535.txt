do not book this hotel when i arrived at the hotel they told me there were no rooms left and that i would have to stay at another hotel they had arranged i was then told the other hotel was in euston i explained that we needed to be in notting hill as we had planned to meet friends there for the evening and that was the reason for our stay they said if i did not accept the other hotel i was not entitled to a refund after much fuss was made amazingly they manage to find us a room in our original hotel the only problem was that they had not cleaned it and the previous guests dirty socks were laid out next to the bed still we were refused a refund so we could go to another hotel we did not even sleep in the bed because we thought looking at the sheets they had not been changed although we could not prove this the next morning after hours of arguing our case i got a refund only the booking com representative who called the hotel manager on our behalf said she had never dealt with such poor customer service and was shocked that the manager had no interest in customer satisfaction whatsoever whist in reception they were redirecting other guests to another hotel so there is no point reading the reviews for this one once you ve paid your money you re at their mercy i never write reviews on trip advisor etc but this time i feel compelled to make sure no one else books this hotel without knowing what sort of stay could await them another point breakfast is ridiculously over priced and cold there is nowhere near enough seats for guests as its a tiny basement room
