i ve never been given such a tiny room you couldn t walk between the bed and the wall without turning sideways there was no space to even put a suitcase flat on the floor the hotel was noisy you could hear machine noises and all the sounds of people coming and going some of the fittings were dirty mould and all of it was in need of serious upgrade this should not be and should not have a high rating on booking com it is very hard not to be sceptical of the reviews of this hotel
