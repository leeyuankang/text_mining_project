rooms are really small and cramped club rooms are small so no extra space for the extra money you spend there is no club lounge so you pay extra to have soft drinks whilst sat in the reception the windows don t open there is a sign that a us of you try to open them they will not return to being in a closed position you do not get the room you request the air conditioning only blows out cold air the heating element doesn t work so your room gets freezing cold you are asked to pay a pre authorisation amount to which on arrival you are told you will receive it straight back this is rubbish they have reserved two separate amounts of my money one of which they didn t inform me of to which haven t been refunded back to me causing my bank to be overdrawn not onlyhos but they have charged me again for my stay so theoretically i have paid twice now i am complaining they are trying to say that it takes working days to get my money released back to me even though they said it would be straight away absolutely terrible experience and can guarantee i will never stay in this hotel or its sister hotels if i return to london
