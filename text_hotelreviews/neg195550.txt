room was tiny i m and the small double bed was the width of the room and my feet touched the wall at one side while my head was on the pillow at the other side there wasn t enough room to lie down on the floor next to the bed the furniture was old and worn drawer on table wouldn t close the shower room was also very very small and the shower tiles grouting were mouldy in places needing replaced duvet could have done with being a king size as the double wasn t enough for the two of us to remain covered all night
