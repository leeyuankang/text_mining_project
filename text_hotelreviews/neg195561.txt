the rooms are very small the bed is not comfortable at all the matrice is too soft and it is a very small bed i would expect from a stars hotel to have at least a bed that is a regular double size bed all in all it is not good value for money as it is quite expensive and the only things that are good about it are the location and the truly helpful staff other than that i would rate it as a less than stars hotel
