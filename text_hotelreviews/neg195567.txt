i had to wait when i arrived because both of the receptioninsts were serving another customer i think one receptionist for each guest would be better the last night there was a problem with the water in bathroom it was very hot and had to wait minutes for the water to get colder in order to wash my hands also the heater needed some time to work everytime i was back in the room
