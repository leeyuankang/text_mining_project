the room we stayed in was very noisy and impossible to sleep in for two reasons window was facing on engins plumbings anyway some kind of huge and embarrassingly rumourous tubes the room is very dark no natural light and from that window you can t see anything at all only those tubes moreover next to our room there was a shared toilet which was in constant use and walls are extremely thin and let you hear absolutely everything in the morning the cleaners were also very noisy and not paying any attention to make their job quieter for people who are still trying to sleep another big problem not secondary was that the room was hot this is shocking for me as i am always cold i have never found myself saying a place was hot in my whole life for the reason i stated above was not possible to open the window and the nights were a real nightmare we didn t try the breakfast so we can t help you with it
