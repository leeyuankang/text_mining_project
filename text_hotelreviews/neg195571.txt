we have been very disappointed as we faced a situation that we considered very cheap we have been informed at our arrival that we will be upgraded to a better room than the one we had during our previous visit the next day we complained on the fact that we have been downgraded as the room was for disabled and not practical at all for us also we had no microwave nor fridge like in the room we had previously to apologize the receptionist offered us a breakfast as a complementary for the next day we really appreciated the effort even if we do not eat in the morning we accepted as she was nice to offer the next day november we informed the lady she looked like the supervisor or the head at reception about the offer we had to compensate us then we went for the breakfast the breakfast was already very simple and poor but the chock was that in the restaurant the waitress informed us that she has been requested to allow us only cold food and not hot food i liked the hotel but for this cheap reaction i will never go back this lady has given a very poor and bad image to this hotel ps we don t even eat hot food and usually only take a coffee and croissant so very cheap from a senior in the hotel
