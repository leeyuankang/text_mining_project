we were told on arrival that we would have to go to another hotel as the boiler had broken down we were not amused as we had small children with us we should have been contacted by reservations we made a fuss and were given a room which was ok when we came back in the evening there was a noise which when we asked staff to have a look at told us it was ventilation we would not have been able to sleep so they moved us to the hotel that we were asked to go to in the daytime
