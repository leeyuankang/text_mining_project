we got a club level room which had a full bed in it while there was a built in closet desk area etc there was just no space to store luggage you couldn t walk around the parameter of the bed so both our suitcases were on the only opening of the floor hard to navigate with two tall people also unsure why there was no conditioner our paris hotel was the same don t know if it is a european hotel thing so if you are used to using conditioner bring some with you
