on arrival staff asked how i booked the room and seemed disappointed by me using booking com suggested that i use their site instead and rather insisted on that to an annoying extent also i felt uncomfortable as i had to give pounds in advance so in case i did any phone calls using the room line the cost would be covered by that amount i really don t understand why i had to do that since i wasn t planning to do any extra costs and if so i could easily pay for that on departure on the top of that the room was ridiculously small so the photos of it are definitely misleading not to mention that it was on the first floor with a view of the inner walls although i chose a room in the upper floors when i booked there are also other funny stuff going on like for example the toilet seat wasn t even customised on the toilet i would definitely not go back or recommend anyone staying there
