i had a club room with my grown doughter we got a double bed that was less than a queen size cm there were no mattress on top off the spring mattress so we woke up several times during the night because we were so uncomfortable the pillows were some strange material one high pillow that made you almost sit up and one worne out flat pillow no down we got a new room the day after with twin beds same bad mattress the rooms was so small we cod only have one suitcase opens and this was a club room i wonder what the other room is like it took so much energy from us not being able to sleep at night that we lost a lot of time in london the managers both that we saw women were very rude to the staff this is something guest notice the breakfast was not good instead of real eggs in the scrambled eggs it was made of powder very small space i am so disappointed spending hundreds of pounds at this hotel catarina
