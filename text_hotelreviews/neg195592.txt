single rooms are extremely small even claustrofobic small i felt like a trunip under the ground night i was given a room with no exterior light and a window with view to a square meter interior hall with huge vertical pipelines the room had no space to put the suitcase other than in front of the cloths cabinet doors preventing the occupant access to the clothes after complaining to the reception staff i was given another room for the and nights the room had outside light was slightly bigger but still a room not fit for a hotel breakfast was lousy
