we were in room which is nothing like it shows in the display picture whilst i understand these things are bound to be varied the bedding decorations were nothing alike the room was small which was fine for the two of us but the window was tucked right round a corner which was opposite a wall so there was no natural light in the room whatsoever the window that they did have back out into a tiny space full of water pipes and wires with an engine of somesort that gave off an annoying buzzing noise the bathroom door was partically see through so you can see your partner sat on the toilet which we didn t really care around but it s just a bit odd on arrival the manager was incredibly rude when i mentioned it would of been cheaper to book on the day rather than in advance she went on to say well obviously here in london which is one of the most popular and beautiful cities in the world the prices can differ everyday we re from the midlands not the other side of the world we know how these things and work in the industry so didn t appreciate being patronised also it s great to have workers that speak different languages but when they can t even understand english speaking customers it isn t not brilliant
