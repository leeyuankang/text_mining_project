room so noisy due to central air conditioning unit placed next to the window room and were single rooms but trikly sold as double the beds were small short narrow and old totally uncomfortable you could not walk around the bed and to go to the toilet we had to jump one over the other literally on the day and after the room change we were told that if we wanted a larger room they could not grant a quiete room unless we paid for an upgrade about pounds per day my husband was disgusted and totally disappointed the following day we were proposed by the kindest of the staff members to be upgraded for free but we did not trust the managers and were afraid they would trick us again so we did not move again
