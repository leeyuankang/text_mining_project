the receptionist was a trainee at check in she took some time but friendly and approachable my complaint is not about her it s about her manager she made me feel uncomfortable at how she spoke to the trainee was very unwelcoming and made me feel embarrassed she behaved the same with all her staff staff all seemed on edge lift was out of order throughout our stay our club room was very very small it was also on the basement floor it was noisy as picked up all outdoor sounds and shuffling of caretakers around the property breakfast was again in the basement very dark and small the gym was locked so couldn t access it was also in what looked like a bed room on the floor which cannot have been that big
