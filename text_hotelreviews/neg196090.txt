we had bad luck wifi and television was temporarily not working and there was no water in the bathroom they on day moved us from our specifically booked room with a view on floor to to another nice room on floor but still low pressure in the pipes they told us it was an outside problem but more sounded like a wellknown internal problems with their pumps the front personel was professionally serviceminded but the attitude was from people under pressure the hotel really has to get a grip to stay stared even if you to not take in mind the missing water and wifi problem it seems more correct to say its a nice star hotel
