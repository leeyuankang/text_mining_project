i would never stay in room again we could hear everything going on in the room above us when we asked the staff they said it was the cleaning people getting supplies this happened several times a day and could even be heard at and tough to sleep when you can hear things being slid across the floor and banging etc it is a floor room just above the hotels main entrance in addition to the noise from above and the cars and people on the street everytime an employee or customer stood outside the hotels front door and smoked a cigarette we could smell it in our room we booked the room for nights and dealt with this every night we asked to change rooms and were told there were no rooms like ours available to switch us too i would ve taken a downgrade if it was offered as an option
