staff was not so friendly this time also my bed was super uncomfortable there were two single mattresses each had a zip to join the two which kept scratching as they were unzipped and mattresses needed to be flipped for these zips not to be on sleeping side unacceptable for a star hotel really plus shower curtain smelled quite bad
