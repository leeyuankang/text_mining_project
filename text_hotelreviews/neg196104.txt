one light in the bathroom flickered a lot but feel like it would have been fixed if had said something to the staff only reason we didn t bother was because we were there one night also on checking in we were told that we needed to make a deposit on the room on card which would be refunded on our check out minus the city tax which i do not remember being on any of the reviews i read beforehand wasn t too much of an issue but was a surprise
