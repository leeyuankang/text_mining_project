we complained about the smoking of other guests despite it being a non smoking hotel the management obviously could not impose this policy as we had to suffer the smoke that came into our room through the aircon vents all throughout our stay aside from the smoke smell the toilet was on one side of our room junior suite and the sink and shower on the other side it was not a pleasant stay at this hotel definitely not worth the money we paid
