even though this is paris the room was pretty small fortunately the good sized bathroom and natural light made up for this however the water pressure was really poor this is a star hotel so being on the floor shouldn t make this an issue on checking out my husband asked for a bill for his work and the service and response was unpleasant i was sitting to one side and saw the eye rolling and dirt looks that went on behind my husband s back this is unacceptable he was informed it would take minutes to complete this procedure if there is an issue with doing this for paying clients than i suggest that the hotel management re access its software or billing processes not a very pleasant way to end our stay
