even though it has undergone a relatively recent renovation the bathroom is already looking a little worn we were in a privilege room room and the tiles in the shower were bulging and warped in places room also suffers from noise transfer from what i can only imagine is the ground floor i don t know if it was the receptionist or bar staff but all night we could hear someone in noisy shoes walking up and down this went on all night through to the morning maybe they need to invest in soft rubber heel shoes complained in the night and the morning but very unsympathetic staff eventually on the third night we were moved to a quieter room at the front of the hotel a much smaller room and no refund was offered for the price paid for a larger room again soundproofing is poor as can hear traffic but preferable to clomping heels through the night if you stay here don t stay in room
