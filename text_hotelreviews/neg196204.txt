a lot of high tables and chairs at breakfast so not very ideal for when you have a toddler they didn t have any meals other than breakfast only sodas and coffee tea hot chocolate but with it so centrally located it s just a quick hop to the restaurant we can recommend the pizza place across the street lovely people and good food make for a great evening within close range of our baby monitor they organise masterchef cooking classes maybe you should put whatever they re making that day or that class on the menu
