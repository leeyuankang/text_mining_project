i was a bit concerned about security at night the front doors were not locked and there was just one person there to mind the front and also the bar its a scary world now sadly so its something that i thought a bit about my first room was tiny but i am glad that i moved to a slightly bigger one they certainly maximized the space i was not certain that the wifi was the best it seemed very slow
