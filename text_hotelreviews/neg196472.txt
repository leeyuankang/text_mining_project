i am an ihg platinum elite level member so usually get upgraded although i hasten to add i don t expect it it s a nice touch for my loyalty on this occasion i was told they were fully booked and that they couldn t do that however they would send a bottle of wine to the room no big deal and i proceeded to my room which was okay at dinner which is next to reception i overheard several guests being told that as platinum members they were being upgraded did i not get the upgrade as i d booked through booking com dinner menu is not exhaustive so i ordered chicken and chips i think when this arrived it was chicken thighs and a bowl of fries no mention of this on the menu and certainly not good vfm imho still feeling hungry i ordered a dessert and was told my first choice was not available i was slight annoyed as it was only in the evening and there were only three people in the restaurant i jokingly asked if i d missed the coach party which i think my attempt at british humour went over the waiter s head somewhat when my second choice dessert arrived creme brulee the brulee was just runny sugar syrup so i questioned this and was told that the chef did not have a blow torch really room hotel in a central london hotel at this point i left unfortunately this is not the first time i have experienced this at this particular hotel restaurant having previously being told they did not have any steak again dining in the restaurant early with only a handful of diners present on that occasion i had to settle for a burger on leaving the restaurant i went to the bar and ordered a drink as i was paying the waiter from the restaurant kindly gave me this on the house again a good gesture however i could not believe that the half bottle of wine that i had not drank at the table was then placed behind the bar
