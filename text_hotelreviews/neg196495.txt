location is middle of no where booking com said it was from the shard which is why i booked turned out to be an hour and half walk or an hour car journey due to traffic the local tube was enough to make anyone not want to travel by tube again hotel prices are ridiculously expensive for the facilities and location if this was more centre london then fair enough but it isn t and made the whole weekend trip more expensive than it needed to be i can t see why there would be any other reason to stay at this hotel
