for the price and location it was relatively good but the breakfast was a major disappointment i usually prioritise that over any other facility i wish booking com would include a breakfast rating by which to filter hotels too the breakfast was quite basic two juice options and neither was fresh one type of eggs fried along with the other standard breakfast options tea coffee baked beans hash brown sausages and a poor selection of processed cheese
