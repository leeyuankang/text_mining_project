i like to be provided with bath robes and slippers when i travel was told when i asked via email that these were only provided in the executive rooms and would i like to upgrade for an extra per night for an executive room i was expecting a slightly different answer it didn t matter as i packed accordingly but in other hotels these would be provided on request
