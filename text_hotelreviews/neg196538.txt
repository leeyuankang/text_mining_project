the bed was a little bit too hard as a twin room we could have done with an extra hand towel and plug sockets next to each bed but otherwise the hotel itself was fab the location was a bit dirty and grubby and whilst fine to walk through during the day we didn t feel it would be safe in the evening to walk to the tube so got a taxi back
