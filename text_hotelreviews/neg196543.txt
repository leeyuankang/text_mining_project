the location of the hotel is in a really not safe area though it is minutes walk to a metro station but strongly recommend people not to take the hotel since you can get a way better location and way better hotel with the same price i was staying in park plaza riverbank with exactly same price in the first two nights but way nicer area and location also way better rooms and services unfortunately they didn t have the other nights available since i booked too late the receptionist who checked us in had the worst attitude ever they locked our luggage and suitcases in the room the second night since our credit card didn t work out and they refused to take our dollars as deposit when we went back to hotel at no upfront notice via phone number or email we left at the check in form they insisted that we shall either go to the atm at at the not safe area or we shall try to make the credit card work an upfront mail about this during the day would be nice very unpleasant stay and not gonna stay there any more not recommending others either actually this worst stay ever even got us really bad impression on holiday inn brand it was the first time in holiday inn and the last time will not stay in holiday inn brand hotels any more
