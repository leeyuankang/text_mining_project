last year the hotel allowed us to keep bikes in our rooms and laid on an early breakfast as we were participating in the ride london i assumed wrongly that their polcy remained the same however despite holiday inns allowing bikes in rooms in other locations this one forbade it their offer to make up for the lack of early breakfast was quite frankly disappointing they could have laid out cereal and fruit instead they provided a ham and cheese sandwich on plastic white bread and an apple i will not be going back
