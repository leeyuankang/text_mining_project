we ordered seafood paella in the restaurant when it came it had other unidentified meat in it as my sister and i only eat seafood i enquired what it was and why it wasn t stated on the menu i was given no apology just asked to pick something else it should have been stated on the menu but even then mistakes happen but an apology would have been nice
