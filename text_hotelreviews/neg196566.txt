when checking in they did not tell us the breakfast time and in the morning we went down and we dicovered that breakfast time was confusing first we were told that it has finished after that another member of staff said but they could not find us on the list which was not supposed to be my problem anyway we did not get any breakfast when checking out i told them the situation and i showed them the booking confirmation just to pay more attention and to double check next time and they found it funny and not very interesting however definitely not star standards
