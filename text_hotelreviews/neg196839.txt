unfortunately once we checked in and went to our room we found that our key was faulty other guests had complained of this while we were in the lobby altogether it took only minutes to resolve but it doesn t make a good first impression london is hot during the summer so the room was humid and stuffy we put the air con on and opened the window only to discover the windows either aren t designed to be opened or quite old and falling apart the latch wouldn t keep the window up and it was too heavy to close ourselves it s disappointing that such a lovely hotel haven t updated their windows
