me and my girlfriend had booked a night at the hotel from the to the of june on arrival just like every other hotel i have stayed at we paid for the room and they add the deposit charge which we were told the deposit is just a holding charge and will refunded back this is completely normal just like every other hotel i have stayed in we were kindly upgraded foc to a master sweet which of course we were very grateful for on departure the following day they requested a second payment for the cost of the room after explaining to the clueless front desk several times i had paid for the room on arrival they were still adamant we need to make a second payment and that the cost of the room and the deposit are just holding charges never heard of this before and nor does it make sense seeing as they have taken the money already on the first day just to refund it back and then pay again great logic there unfortunately i did not have a receipt as we were not provided with one i should have requested one but i did not assume i would need to prove my innocence to them that i have paid already as it would show on their system which they checked and apparently no payment was showing annoyingly barclays bank were undergoing some maintenance so i had no way of accessing my accounts via app or online to show the payment i had made on the the staff were very patronising and made me and my girlfriend feel cheap as if we were trying to get away with not paying in the end we had to pay again as we were holding up their que as i couldn t access my bank to transfer further funds to my account so my girlfriend had to make the second payment this was meant to be a treat for her from myself following a promotion at her work i ve never felt so embarrassed i left feeling very bitter and robbed
