the entire hotel decor was tired i would say it s more a our room needed redecorating as there were dark patches on the ceiling and parts of the walls the rooms were noisy you could other people s doors opening and banging shut you could also clearly hear people s conversations when they were in the hallway felt like they were in the same room i can honestly say in terms of general noise i e doors opening and slamming shut works being carried out outside it is the noiseiest hotel i ve ever stayed in
