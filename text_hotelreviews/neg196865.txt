the room was very dated and needed a lot of refurbishing the window was cracked and overlooked a very ugly sight in order to shut the door completely you had to actually slam it the walls were so thin that we could hear our neighbors quite loudly all night long there were not enough usable outlets in the room and the lighting was very poor
