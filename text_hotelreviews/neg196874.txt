the bathroom was tired the bath panel had seen better days and was tatty the shower over the bath was fine and hot water plentiful however the bath was narrow and the shower curtain kept encroaching my fear when we were informed of the upgrade to a deluxe twin was that this meant no double bed this was realised by the fact that the twin beds were pushed together with no topper or other method of covering the gap between them our experience in the restaurant was not great the food was very good and the menu suited us well unfortunately the staff appeared to be new and had little idea of what they were doing there was only people in the whole restaurant but still they found it hard to attend to us when the wine came it was poured spilt on the table cloth and the bottle taken away the waiter had to be escorted back to the table with the bottle ordering the meal was challenging i was informed that my main course came with mash but when it arrived there was none after what seemed an age i finally had to go and find the waitress to ask for a desert menu my wife asked what cheeses were on the cheese board the waitress went away to ask the chef and returned with the information this persuaded my wife to order when the board arrived it was carrying completely different cheeses none of which she liked this was to be a special meal for my wife s birthday appreciating london prices the stay over was not cheap the experience was unfortunately underwhelming to say the least
