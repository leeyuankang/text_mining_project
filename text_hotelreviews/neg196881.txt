bed was broke in our room took nearly an hour to get moved to another room with waiting for staff to check the bed was actually broke and getting another room key we did get upgraded to a better room though which was much better than the room we were originally in staff not very helpful and didn t seem bothered about making us feel welcome at the hotel
