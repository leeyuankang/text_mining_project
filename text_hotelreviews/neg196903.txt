i booked a twin room and this was acknowledged by reception when we checked in however they had to make a call up to housekeeping to check if the room had been setup as a twin it hadn t reception told me they often don t make up a twin this until the guests arrive so they can confirm if that bed arrangement is actually required this isn t efficient as i had to wait for the room to be fixed they could have called me to confirm before i arrived or trusted my booking and set up the room as a twin if it s wrong that would have been my mistake
