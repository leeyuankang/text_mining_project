the curtains in the room were filthy there was what appeared to be a substance on the bath which i cleaned off and the dressing table was very wobbly i was only there one night new years eve so didn t highlight the issues as especially because i was given a room upgrade without asking and it was nye you have to pay a deposit on a credit card which gets refunded but something to bear in mind our room door also clattered every time someone opened a door in the corridor very noisy and i was told i was placed in the quiet part of the hotel i would stay here again if i wasn t expecting absolute luxury i would say it wasn t worth the money i paid unfortunately would be comfortable paying
