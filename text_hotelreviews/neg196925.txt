the upgrade was a bit of a disappointment for the price we paid we were expecting something a little more fine tuned however one of the major let downs was the air conditioning we couldn t adjust it which meant that we were over heated the entire night and didn t sleep at all well i had reported this to reception but no one came to see it and we had dinner plans so i had to leave the minor details are the room looked tired i had to request a minibar to be in the room but they soon brought one up this was a king size bed but it was quite uncomfortable and was a very hard mattress pillows were not in proportion to the bed i think it needs a feminine touch to bring it really on par with other hotels in mayfiar at the same rate
