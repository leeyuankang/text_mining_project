the room i was allocated was very narrow the bed head was positioned under the window narrow access to bathroom it was an exercise in limited space management and a successful outcome achieved however this is not a budget hotel i expected more space for the rate charged i noted the mini bar was not stocked up according to the list of what should have been available no biscuits or shortbread with a very sparsely stocked tea and coffee area in the room a bit disappointing for a top location in mayfair got the feeling that it doesn t have to try the location alone will sell rooms
