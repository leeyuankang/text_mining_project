the staff were very rude lack of communication the iron that was given to us exploded causing me to have an electric shock the breakfast facilities were not clear in orientation when arriving back late at night the night member of staff got frustrated at us for not pushing the correct door and was not at all hospitable due to the iron exploding we had a power outage for minutes and although the power was turned back on after this time the sockets in the room either side of the bed were not this caused us to have not have charged phones and therefore we were unable to even take photos let alone post them on social media or even use our iphones for gps upon complaining the manager gave us a pathetic discount of and offered us an upgrade this was despite us exclaiming as clearly as we could without swearing that we would not be staying there again in event
