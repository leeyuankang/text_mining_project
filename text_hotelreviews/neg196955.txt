reception on arrival was alright but no information about brekfast times or if we could use restaurant the following night we only discovered it was out of use by a note in the lift from the manager not there in the morning to say it would be closed from for a private function staff would direct us to a suitable establishment we did not think this was at all acceptable we had to go to reception to ask for a room service menu they told us to look for it in the room we already had we were not believed which disappointed us in the end we rang room service and asked for someone to bring a menu to us that staff member then waited at the door for us to decide remember the customer is always right and there was definitely no menu in that room reception gentleman couldnt wait to tell us we had a refurbed room but omitted important things as above no one helped us to our room with the luggage or even pointed out the lifts there were no easy chairs in the room and although the bathroom was adapted there was only a shower over the bath whilst i agree i did not ask for a special room i was unable to use this as i am unable to get in and out of a bath the expense of a part renovated bathroom seemed pointless it needs a rethink no biscuits on the hospitality tray and you had to take the kettle over to the desk to boil we did have to ask for extra tea coffee and milk and after a minute wait i had to ring room service again for these items i had originally asked reception before we went up to our room only piece of paper for the desk and no pen these items would have been helpful helping us plan our day this was the first hotel i have been in where not provided there was no way of adjusting the heating in our room and although we opened the windows we were still very hot for a high end hotel we were disappointed by some of the staff and communication also some facilities were lacking
