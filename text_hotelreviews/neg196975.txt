the reception staff were abrupt and unhelpful daniel didn t offer help with luggage and didn t provide information how to find room the room has inadequate curtains to block out the light they are four strips of material but the biggest concern was there was a blood stain on the underneath of the bedding that we discovered when turning down the bedding to get in we paid a significant sum to stay in this hotel and when we checked out early and told daniel the problems we were not offered any recompense the room was also very noisy located near a fire door that constantly banged we left early
