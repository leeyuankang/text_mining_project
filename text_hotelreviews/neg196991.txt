when we arrived there was no booking record very disconcerting to say the least after min this was sorted out and we were shown to a room which had two single beds plus an extra bed this had not been requested we were then given another room by then much of our time had been wasted as we needed to be else where we had to hurry off on returning to our accommodation late evening we realised that there was only one bedside table lamp no bathrobes only one armchair in a superior king room supposedly the chest of drawers was in a state of disrepair with one handle on the lower drawer hanging off obviously housekeeping left a lot to be desired these issues were raised with management at checking out and we received off the room tariff and the promise of a room upgrade in the event of any future booking which we feel is highly unlikely the whole experience was very unsatisfactory indeed the breakfast by the way was very mediocre overall not at all value for money
