some of the staff were absolutely so rude our tv didn t work so they just messed us around with rooms and blah blah saying they gave us this and that room at the end they gave us smaller rooms then tried to charge us kept taking different amounts of money from my account which still hasn t returned just disgusting service so confusing and time consuming not worth it especially when on holiday just a star hotel with a good name living off the mayfair name nowhere near its standards oh the hotel room was very dusty and caused breathing problems here and there not the fault of the cleaning staff but the senior management who should be on top of these things if you want to be in mayfair as a new visitor in london spend a little more money and get something better yes its cheaper than some but its cheap for a reason spend wisely
