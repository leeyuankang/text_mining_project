we did not use the services of the concierge except once and that individual was very helpful the overall impression given by several of the concierge staff was that they were bored and would rather not be bothered this may be an unfair assessment from afar but on one other occasion when the front desk requested that the duty concierge obtain an item for me there was nothing that would challenge that assessment
