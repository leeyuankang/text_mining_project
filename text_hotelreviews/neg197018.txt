the price if i had not paid for the room and was a visitor i would of thought i was in a travel inn or travel lodge i get the location but is a complete rip off as far as i m concerned i felt robbed the bathroom was exactly the same as a travel lodge for that kind of money i expect a decent bath a shower cubicle something a little luxurious for gods sake my partner purchased the full english breakfast and for it was worse that stopping at a motorway services i would appreciate a refund but i know this will never happen i suppose i can add my negative feedback onto trip adviser and a few various hotel recommendation sites and hope someone see s and does not experience what i did for such an extortionate sum of money completely mis sold and completely ripped off
