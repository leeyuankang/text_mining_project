although being quite clear with reception when i checked in that my husband would be joining later after work when he arrived he was interrogated when trying to check in and in the first instance refused to issue a second key and was lied too telling him that it was not policy to be issued with a second key he was escorted to the bedroom where i was getting ready and in a bathrobe and did not appreciate this situation my husband came down mins later and spoke to another very helpful member of the staff who without hesitation issued a second key
