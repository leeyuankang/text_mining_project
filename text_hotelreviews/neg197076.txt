they put us in a room with dry damp overlooking a building site when we asked to move as it would wake us early in the am they were happy to do so but we found ourselves in a room so small i could not even change in the end we needed to upgrade our room at a charge of pounds per night to get the same room size as we had on night one a lot of hassle and moving room to room made the stay unpleasant
