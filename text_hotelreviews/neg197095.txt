the hotel tried to move me to another hotel with terrible ratings because it had overbooked the hotel it took me over an hour to sort out a room for myself the room i had was right above the street so therefor very noisy there were no sheers in the room so i had to close the blinds completely which didn t allow enough light the soap bars were cut in half obviously an attempt to save money the shower didn t work
