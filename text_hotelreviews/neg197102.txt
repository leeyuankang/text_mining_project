i had booked rooms for the night before my daughters wedding i rang to confirm that rooms were on specific floors with right bed configuration times before we arrived when we arrived there was an obvious mix up no communication had been given to staff allocating rooms my daughter bride to be and myself were taken to a room full of furniture so that we couldn t get in it the staff moved us to another room we were given a choice but one was cold and smelt of smoke the other was ok we wasted hour getting sorted we had booked dinner in the madison restaurant and so were offered a complimentary bottle of prosecco but this arrived at the end of the meal overall we were very disappointed with the situation
