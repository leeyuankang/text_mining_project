the hotel made a mistake with our twin room it took us minutes to get into our room once we had a key as the lock was broken then it was a double room not a twin it was before we got access to use to shower we had to use this room as we had dinner booked for and finally got into our room at pm when we returned from our evening out then we had to unpack not good to say we arrived at am and confirmed with reception that our room was a twin room
