hotel is quite isolated from everywhere closest food other than the hotel restaurant was too far to walk nearest train station is minutes walk away asked hotel to call a taxi and they called a chauffeur which was unnecessary and cost us pound for a minute journey we were also very disappointed to be woken up at around the next day to construction work right outside our hotel door there was a lot of incredibly loud banging as well as drilling into the hotel wall i called reception to ask them what was going on but they had no knowledge about half an hour later we heard someone come up from reception to ask them to stop until our room had been vacated but by that time my three year old son had been woken up by the noise not sure what happened there in terms of hotel organisation but it s not suitable for a hotel to conduct maintenance at in the morning hotel staff were apologetic and i think a little embarrassed that it had happened but no real compensation was offered it really affected the rest of our day as we were all tired and very grumpy especially the three year old pretty disappointed
