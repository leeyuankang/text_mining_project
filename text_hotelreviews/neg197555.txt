the reception staff were incredibly rude and unhelpful to all of my guests having worked on behalf of radisson in the past i found this quite embarrassing no one greeted us on arrival or helped us with bags and wedding bits the check in systems also took ages with all desk staff finding it confusing no smiles no customer charm and no offer to assist with anything other than complicated check in systems the facilities were fantastic but the staff made what was meant to be a very special time for me wedding time quite stressful and i dreaded having to deal with them
