i booked the room last october as a twin room but on arrival were given a king double bed which was unsuitable as i was sharing a room with my daughter we were offered an upgrade initially at which we thought too much but the priced was reduced to we accepted this but i would have appreciated not having to pay for an upgrade given that i had booked so far ahead
