i got into a bit of a muddle regarding a complementary i could use with the room i didn t have the opportunity to redeem it until the next morning when i was checking out all i asked for were a couple of coffees i confirmed with the check out staff who said it was still ok to redeem but the bar staff making the coffee said it wasn t and wanted to charge me for coffees conversations went back and forth between bar and check in staff and confusion reigned for minutes i ended up signing a bar bill still not sure whether or not that will end up appearing on my credit card after all that crazy simplify please
