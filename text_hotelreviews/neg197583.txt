at check in we were offered an upgrade and the member of staff made it sound like we were getting a lovely room as there had been a cancellation eventually she told us it would be an extra for the pleasure no thanks along the way it seemed as though we constantly been asked for our card details or upsold something being asked to spend extra money all the time really left a bad taste and ruined the experience for us at check out we were told we had taken items from the mini bar and were charged for that i nearly lost it as that wasn t true after everything it was the icing on the cake they did realise it was a mistake and corrected it
