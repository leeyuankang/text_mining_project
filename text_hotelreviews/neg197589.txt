i was mis informed in regards to my breakfast i paid extra for breakfast upon arriving and two mornings when i tried to order my breakfast i was told it wasn t paid for on my room the first morning i was sent complimentary champagne as an apology and the second morning they sent the breakfast and tried to charge upon checkout the issue was resolved but they need to make it clearer to guest what they are paying for to avoid confusion and irate customers other than that the hotel was perfect it s missing a sauna and or jacuzzi
