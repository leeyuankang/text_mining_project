dissappointed with check in i was charged the full room rate as the male receptionist did not notice any different from my booking booking com price was i was given no details about the time of breakfast or where it was and he gave us no directions of where to find the lifts or that we needed to use the room key to operate them we had parked our car almost right outside as we managed to get a space and we were quite happy to leave it there so i asked him if it was ok to park outside and he said parking is even thoughbooking com says and so i paid and he gave me an envelope and a receipt so the car could have valet parking which i was not interested in especially after having to pay extra on the price of the room i half listened into the conversation of the people checking into next to me and they were dealt with much differently with more information maybe the gentlemen that served me was new i mentioned it when i checked out the next day and the lady refunded the for me still a little annoyed about the unnecessary valet parking another unnecessary expense but hey ho
