room view was of a multistorey carpark office building opposite lacking a swimming pool which you would expect of a hotel of this type we knew beforehand of course but its just surprising especially where there is a spa staff seemed a bit non plussed just got handed an envelope with key card in it no mention of where or when breakfast was or any other ancilliary info location is bit off the beaten track it seems be located in a semi gated community where cars are given prio over pedestrians for pavement space
