the fact we had to complain waited for half hour to sort it to get the rooms we asked for and paid for originally as put on different floor to our daughters the price of the breakfast for both days we didn t have in the end although did hear other guests offered it for each the cost of parking but then it is london we were offered a room upgrade due to cost of breakfast but would have had to pay per room per night so that worked out the same as the breakfast what was the point there don t think we will be staying there again will go to premier inn or travellodge where we can get breakfast included and free parking
