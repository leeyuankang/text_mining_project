being called down to reception at midnight to pay our bill due to no one on check in taking our details having housekeeping walk in a number of times before and after going for breakfast and having the plates cleared before we had finished there were no trays so if you wanted more then two items you had to go back which we did we wanted fruit too room service wasn t all that great kitchen apparently closes half an hour before it mentions and then the sandwiches offered on the late night menu are not worth the amount they charge you charges added to our bill a day before we even checked in so they weren t us at all minimal tea making facilities only thing offered back after all the inconvenience was the two lots of the free credit included in our room and a free upgrade if we ever wished to return which they managed to take from my account instead of put back
