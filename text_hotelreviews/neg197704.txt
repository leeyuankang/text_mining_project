the location we found it so hard to find even after getting off the drl we could see the hotel but couldn t go round the front because it was gated up with padlocks so we had to walk all the way round the back where we just guessed our way understandably there were roadworks going on but they need to place signs for the hotel around the area we got into the new providence wharf and it still took us mins to find the hotel because there were no signs around just guessing again the scenery views were incredible though
