the bed was still too firm despite being padded with a topper and a duvet facilities being listed on tv rather than in handy booklet form instructions for use of safe and aircon in small type and in dimly lit areas unreadable for the elderly unless armed with a light and a magnifying glass a lovely very slippery bath with soap etc anchored at the wrong end i had to use the bathroom with great caution as so many surfaces were slippery i hate showers so it is accurate to say that comfort was lacking my son complained at the time about inconsiderate parking as cars were parked in the turning circle he drove me to and from the hotel and to visit family etc
