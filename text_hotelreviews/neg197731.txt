as a diabetic the breakfast items were limited we were not offered the menu items to choose from but encouraged to have buffet breakfast the website stated a free shuttle service was available when i asked about this service i was told it wasn t being offered the hotel is difficult to locate due to limited signage which we didn t notice until we were leaving having walked past it four times
