the checkout staff in the morning seemed tired and miserable the taxi firm the reception recommended carrot cars left me and my family waiting in the cold outside the for over an hour we booked it for and he hadn t arrived by so we managed to find another taxi firm this ruined the evening as we had to have the children in school in norwich the following morning they were cold and tired and because of this i ll book at the intercontinental to avoid the trip back after the gig shame because the taxi firm you recommended has cost you future bookings
