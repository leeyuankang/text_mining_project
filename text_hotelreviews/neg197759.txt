after reading the reviews i was expecting something much nicer it s a contemporary hotel but nothing in the room was contemporary i mean it didn t even have a dock for music from your iphone the tv had some channels but didn t offer any movies to rent the king room was very small and so was the bathroom i felt almost claustrophobic the view from this room was down to the hotel entrance was much better than the first room i had been given when i checked in as the room was facing a block of buildings i had this swapped first the walls are thin we could hear the neighbours talking
