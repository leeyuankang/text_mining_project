the bed was like sleeping on the floor it was far too hard we didn t sleep well at all no check back on food from staff plates weren t hot hence resulted in food going cold quickly couldn t quite understand why chips peppercorn sauce came with steak yet all additional side orders had to be ordered separately for the corn fed chicken making it an expensive meal a porter to greet us at the door with our luggage would ve been a nice touch never stayed at a hotel where there is a lovers kit in the fridge door lol
