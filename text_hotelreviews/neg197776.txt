the air con in our room was so loud we couldn t sleep in peace at all not a pleasant experience with staff removing our luggage without notifying us while we were out and checking us in in an existing customer s room no sincere apologies from the staff who made the mistake who was present when we checked out and the staff who said would sort everything out after we return from dinner
