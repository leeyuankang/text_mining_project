i got a room for a higher price than a friend i was travelling with i therefore got a voucher for food for we had diner at the restaurant together but by mistake we asked the charges to be put on my friend s room when we were checking out the next day i asked if they could transfer the diner charges to my room so i could use the voucher the reception did it withot any problem but when it came to paying they said it was not possible to use the voucher i had no time escalate this to a manager on duty so paid for the diner however i am very disappointed in the way i was treated
