we stayed here in for the same event and it was amazingly good the staff went out of their way last year to accommodate cyclists and their was a handwritten card in our room to wish us luck for the event which was such a nice touch there wasn t anything like that this time though which was a bit of a shame it was all a bit humdrum this time and it seemed like a lot of money for a fairly basic room with breakfast not included the really dark bathrooms are a bit depressing and the corridors are a bit bleak
