not very well signposted from the main road very frustrating booking process despite providing full names and details rooms were under children s names booked a number of rooms together enquired about parking spaces but not told there was valet parking not a big problem but just basic information that could have been provided when asked would have been nice to have complimentary breakfast or something as a token though appreciate that s a nice to have rather than something to expect
