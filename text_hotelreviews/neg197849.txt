the food we had as evening meal was definitely under par when i asked for garlic mushrooms in a cream sauce on sourdough bread it was greasy and soggy toast the same was the experience of cheese turnovers on champ literally soggy cheese pasties on mash potato the cream sauce tasted literally like cream with green chives tasteless we expected a much higher standard that matched the quality of the hotel and stay utterly disappointed especially as it was a celebration trip for my husbands birthday we did mention this at check out to the lady at reception who s name escapes me but she was so helpful pr we were offered an apology and service charge refunded
