no direct footpath to arena if you go to a concert you will have to pay ca for a one way taxi ride or take the dlr and change once back to the underground one of the reception staff had quite the attitude while trying to order my taxi not at me but at the cab company rolling her eyes and huffing arrogantly into the phone i would expect more professionalism from front staff came back from the concert to be met by police and screaming guests and night staff it was rather unpleasant to squeeze by a police officer blocking the entrance views where of another office building close the blinds and a building site not many amenities around the hotel as far off the beaten track
