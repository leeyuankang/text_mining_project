i booked my trip with booking com they sent me a text to say i could check in and pay online so i thought i d do this to make it easier for when i arrived but they tried to charge me again for the hotel on arrival which i said and proved to them that i had already paid for the hotel the reception staff asked me to send an email to her so she could send it on they gave us our key to the room until the check out came the following day they tried to make me pay for the hotel again and i explained the situation of events the day before and they said that was fine we check out to only come home and find a second payment was taken without my knowledge really not happy about the level of knowledge when booking online with the staff on site
