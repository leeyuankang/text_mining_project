cleaning could pay just a little closer attention to detail but overall it is an excellent property the most irritating factor is probably the guest services agent who answers each time you phone for anything within the hotel and then redirects your call or takes a message i far prefer to contact a department directly rather than having to relay to guest services that i would like reception to contact me about my stay for example why go through all that when i can simply call reception myself
