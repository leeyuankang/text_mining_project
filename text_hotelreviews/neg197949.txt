when entering the room we found the toilet was still in a mess from the previous customer the minibar did not open but that did not stop the staff coming to our door to ask if we had taken anything from it and even wanted to inspect it and after that the safe wasnt working on the first night so we had to walk around with our valuables on our person we also faced a building site and were woken up at not what i was looking forward to
