the music in the bar of an evening was far too upbeat and way too loud for polite conversation to happen even the waitress couldn t hear me when i was saying i wanted to move to the lobby that s a pretty dumb move rb not easy to get to the as it s a taxi ride away or a long walk to canary wharf tube other than the pizzeria you re only local option for eating out is to walk to the gun pub but they aren t cheap
