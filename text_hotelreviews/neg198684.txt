the breakfast was exceptionally poor looked like a shortage of staff lead to a lack of everything had to wait so long for the rest of breakfast to arrive that what we had already selected was cold none of the staff were friendly seemed impatient with being asked where things were the eating area looked very tired had been down graded to a cafe with wooden stirrers instead of spoons left feeling as though we should have eaten out the pillows on the bed smelt of cigarette smoke which we would have changed had it not been so late when we realised last time we stayed we really enjoyed it that s why we booked again
