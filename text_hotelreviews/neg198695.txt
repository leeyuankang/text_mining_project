no help with luggage one bathrobe missing insufficient bathroom shampoo for two air con awful slept in a room far to hot and air con did not work and yes i did follow the instructions we didn t call for help as we were far to tired and didn t want to have to wait for assistance and after the service at the concierge we didn t think the hotel could be bothered the room was supposed to be a deluxe which was supposed to include a seating area unless this meant the desk chair there was none i was suspicious this was not a deluxe room i have stayed in american chain hotels before never again in a hilton
