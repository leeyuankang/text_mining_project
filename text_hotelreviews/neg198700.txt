i was disappointed about a paying extra for the roof balcony for a special occasion and we wasn t able to use because it shuts at i wasn t been informed and it wasn t been run briefly what s written on the paper that was given to me i guess it will be a good idea if you run briefly what s on the paper because not all guest have the time to read especially if rushing into something e g like getting ready and going out for dinner b being disappointed with the receptionist night duty when we are trying to enter to the left side entrance and he showed me a rude gesture instead of saying please use the other entrance door c same as the door staff whose a bit rude about asking for room key assuming we wasn t guests even if it s protocol to ask maybe in a nice way not being so rude i just find it humiliating showing of rudeness paying that amount of money is not worth to be not treated nice
