this appears to be a hotel which caters mainly to business people decor is modern and bland shades of grey some rooms have separate bath and shower which we would have preferred bathtub deep and narrow some difficulty in getting in and out when wet shower doors tend to allow water to flood the floor found the air conditioning to be too cold and somewhat noisy window opens but too noisy outside at night to keep open
