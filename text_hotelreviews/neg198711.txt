some of the staff was not very helpful and not understanding making it our fault they did not have a room according to our order and trying to be nice as if they were doing us a favor when finding another room that was according to our booking we had seen some feedback from geust getting cakes and welcome gifts when there was a birthday or anniversary i don t know who payed them for writing that comment or feedback because that is not how it is we got neither eventhough we sent them messages through bookings as we were celebrating both as if they had never got the messages and did not expect us at all if i refer to the arrival the staff was just not helpful at all trying to make us stay a bit more comfortable eventhough we asked for it
