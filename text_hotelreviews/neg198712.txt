third year in a row this hotel has messed up our booking details i would never choose to stay here if it wasn t for work on check in we were also convinced to stay in accessible rooms on a newly refurbished floor the rooms were not newly refurbished they were simply refurbished to make them accessible by removing the bath and having accessible friendly features this type of room wasn t necessary for myself and my colleagues and were totally mis described at check in my advice would be to stick with your original room if offered this it was a busy period in the london bridge area but even so this hotel is very over priced i d recommend the london bridge hotel in preference if available
