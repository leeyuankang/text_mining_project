i was charged safety deposit without my knowledge the staff did not mention this at check in or check out which i think is really unprofessional i had to call them to find out what it was for the breakfast was good with a varied choice but because it was a buffet some of it was cold would be fine of course but for what you are paying you would expect a higher standard basically you stay at this hotel for the amazing location and nothing else be warned though they are currently constructing a new part of london bridge station which is opposite the hotel they work at weekends and through the night and it s noisy no sunday lie in that is for sure try and request a room away from the street if you can
