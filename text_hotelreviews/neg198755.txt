as soon as we got in the room there was a awful high pitched noise coming from the bathroom i called down to reception straight away they sent someone up who told me it was probably just air in the pipe and if it happens again just run the taps for a bit not really the response i expected from a premium chain of hotels it did happen again and again it was ear piercing and it went on through the night i didn t want to ring down to reception again as i didn t feel i was being taken seriously all in all a very disappointing stay
