first experience at a hilton hotel i booked it thinking it would be a a step up over premiere inn and also perhaps a nice romantic place to stay it wasn t no attention to detail tv features for movies were slow and occasionally crashed the tv itself was pretty old with a terrible picture we ordered room service at it was promised minutes later but turned up passed and stone cold shower leaked everywhere breakfast was a rush and pretty manic the bar at the hotel was pricey but the cocktails were good we had a voucher for off which was met with a feeling of hostility as the bar manager went of his way to approach us to query it which was surprising especially as it only saved us quid lastly the noise every morning at around there was some high pitch repetitive squeal which came from within the hotel
