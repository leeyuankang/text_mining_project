i ordered breakfasts to my room we was looking forward to the breakfasts after a great night out i was told it finally came and everything was cold and didn t looked cooked and the toast wasn t toasted and it look like stale bread u wouldn t give it the birds the manger was nice and offered two more but i didn t trust the person cooking the breakfast the manger took the breakfast off the price i think but we left the hotel hungry very disappointed and also when i arrived to room the battery in my tv remote had gone i phoned down to the desk but didn t come to the room so i had to go down myself to get some i didn t like that after they said someone will come to the room
