bar prices very high even for london although the food at jamie s was good we felt the restaurant was understaffed we had quite a wait for tea and coffee both mornings and tables were left uncleared more staff on duty would resolve this shower is over the bath which means space is a bit restricted minor point we thought hotel was a bit stingy with the toiletries left in the bathroom as there was only enough for one person although it was a double room
