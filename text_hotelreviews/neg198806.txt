the room i was given had a broken window could not close properly when we arrived in the late evening of the the night manager reassured us that it will be fixed the following day the following day we left to town and we specifically mentioned at the desk that we were leaving and that they can do their repair they did nothing on that day and neither on the following net result we spent loud and rather cold nights wind howling through the window crack ac working overtime to keep up you could call it romantic but it was not what we were after very disappointing
