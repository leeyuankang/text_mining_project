this hotel is run by accountants not enough managers and too many untrained teenage staff the room lights are such a low wattage you can t see length of time taking to be served is very long bar prices are very high for this standard of hotel and service had to queue for breakfast coffee at a leaky machine weak tea is served from a flask food at the breakfast buffet was cold even as it arrived from the kitchen pillows were low quality there was a fire drill at just after am i don t mind fire drills these are essential but not all customers left their rooms and we just walked to the lobby and straight back up if you don t do a fire drill properly you are just disturbing your customers for no reason
