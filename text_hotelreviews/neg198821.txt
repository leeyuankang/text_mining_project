breakfast was poor no one serving at cooking area visiting electrical tradesman had to go through the back to get someone when chef arrived he pointed for me to go to the other counter but i said there are no eggs or hash browns he then brought out a tray of cooked eggs from the back that unfortunately were completely cold not a good experience
