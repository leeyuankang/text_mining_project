at the moment with the closure of tower bridge and the building works at london bridge station there are delays with traffic fortunately there is a pleasant walk from the hotel along the river to london bridge where traffic is moving a little better also the music if you could call it music in the bar was so loud we had to shout to each other and the bar manager did not reduce the volume on request
