the reservation staff member who checked us in was very pleasant but did not inform me that he had tried to take a deposit from the bank card on the hotel s system that card declined had he told me first that he was going to take payment i would have been able to transfer funds on my phone instead i was a little embarrassed and had to ask why he didn t inform me first before taking funds apart from this the stay was great
