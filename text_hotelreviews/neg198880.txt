we were given the option of a larger room with walk in shower or a smaller room with a bath tub not needing a bath tub we opted for the former but the staff didn t explain this was a room for people with mobility problems the room and bathroom would have been excellent for someone in a wheelchair but less so for people who aren t in a wheelchair better communication from staff would have been appreciated
