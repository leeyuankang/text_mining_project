cold shower in morning not pleasant hairdryer didn t work but did get it changed towels were tatty and fraying the screen on the bath was not fixed properly and was a safety issue price of water small bottle for night expensive and money taken from my card immediately when the booking said it would be done on arrival also i was under the impression i had booked the double tree at tower hill which is where i had been before so i was very disappointed when i arrived there to find i was not booked in even though i d paid the confusion was explained by the consierge and my partner and i had to walk all the way to the tower bridge hotel site which in my opinion having now stayed at both is the poor relation both in location and amenities last time i was also given a vip card on arrival for the executive lounge this time i was told it would be extra each per day obviously i was very disappointed with the lack of customer care
