the breakfast at jamie s restaurant was very poor the food was ok but the service was shambolic on both days we stayed we had to track down our own cutlery cups and coffee tea which was horrible anyway we complained about this to the hotel who told us it was subcontracted to jamie s and there was nothing they could do
