we checked in at and the only available room was a disabled access room we could have waited for a regular room but had time constraints as we were meeting friends so had to accept the available option the room itself was fine but the shower absolutely soaked the entire bathroom no matter how accurately you placed the curtains making it unusable really for anything other than another shower
