breakfast was disappointing whilst the food was tasty and varied we were seated only for the table to be taken by another couple whilst we were getting our food not sure how this came about but it led to an embarrassing situation which with better management could have been avoided the staff failed to help and the breakfast experience certainly didn t seem like value for money definitely put me off returning in addition we wanted to eat our lunch outside because it was a beautiful day and the promotion pictures suggested that this would be a lovely thing to do but staff told us they were only serving lunch inside so we went elsewhere couldn t help feeling that the great potential of this hotel isn t being fully realised
