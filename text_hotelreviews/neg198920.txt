the breakfast at jamie s was very average the staff in jamie s weren t very professional or interested at all in the customers we had to ask for cutlery and milk for our drinks we weren t told where anything was and most of the food was just leftover scraps only good part of the breakfast was unlimited orange juice although the room service from jamie s was brilliant so perhaps just the morning staff aren t too good
