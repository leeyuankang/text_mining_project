one of the reception staff aleksha not quite sure on the name spelling nevertheless she was on duty on april at upon arrival i approached her and informed her that i want to book a room for the night lifting her head she said we are fully booked and head down back on what she was doing scrutinising some papers well that s fine no harm done only if she was not lying we are not stupid to pay for a taxi and head to the hotel if booking com did not show rooms available as my phone s battery is so low we chose to book direct when she said we are fully booked i sat on the couch near the reception area and booked online so we got the room the staff who assisted me offered a free wine and bottled water probably as a compliance on the hotels protocol if you are not satisfied with your stay let us know and we ll make it right thank you for doing that but such gesture can not cover a staff negative attitude as it comes within if you are busy on other things you should stay on a room where you are not visible to guests or at least put a note like proceed to next till maybe rather than giving a negative vibe on the hotels reception area when i start talking about her attitude one of the male receptionist tried to cover her by saying head office sometimes forget to update the system really another lie if your head office forget to update your system booking com should not be showing rooms available besides when i said i have a room booked the receptionist was not even worried that it s an overbooking so meaning you have or maybe even rooms empty i booked a double and she was happily asking me if i prefer twin than a double honestly i stayed to many hotels some negative staff behaviour just passed me along but this kind of attitude is embodied with lie as all proof of her lying was proven
