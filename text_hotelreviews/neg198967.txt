we stayed new year s eve and were not told there was a private party being held so we were not able to use any of the ground floor facilities we were told to go to bar on first floor which were not serving either cocktails or coffee the toilets in ground floor were a disgrace after people had been sick and toilets were filthy the room was basic with a poor view and i specifically asked for good view and phoned and sent emails to request this the balcony on floor closed st which would have been great to view the shard and new year s eve fireworks
