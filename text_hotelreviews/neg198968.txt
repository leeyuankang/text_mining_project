we were a party of in london for a special occasion we all had deluxe rooms i am unsure what extra s we got for the additional expence hence because we paid a little more for better accommodation this has impacted on the overall review there is room for improvement as a regular traveller uk international i cannot understand why large hotel chains in the uk do not provide free wi fi for everyone the pillows were very soft there was only spare the info states dressing gowns and slippers are available we only had one of each in a twin room the shower was disappointing as the water pressure was not very powerful and the water did not get very hot our water glasses were not washed and the coffee making facilities were not returned to the cupboard when the room was cleaned the maids knocked quite early circa to see if the room could be made up we acknowledge that we should probably have put the do not disturb notice on the door this really could be organised so that rooms are identified as vacant once people having booked out our tv did not work on our first night we reported a fault and someone came to look at this he was unable to rectify the problem and said he would come back with another cable and didn t we reported this again the next morning and this was fixed whilst we were out for the day all equipment should be checked when the room is prepared for the next guests breakfast is available in jamie s and is quite expensive we asked if there was a weatherspoon s in the area and the staff did not know an internet search revealed there were a short walk away staff having better local knowledge would be helpful a covered smoking area would be good a lot of people congregated on the terrace outside jamie s in the rain and as there was no specific smoking area or any ashtrays the floor became littered with cigarette buts
