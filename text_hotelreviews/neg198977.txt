on arrival i found an open half eaten prawn sandwich in my minibar not pleasant but it was dealt with satisfactorily the jamie oliver restaurant in the hotel was ok for food but the staff were sullen and not very friendly at breakfast i had to get up and ask one of the staff about coffee no one approached me or asked me if i needed anything very poor
