the gym on the floor is too small going to another place for a workout is not practical so that is a downside the only downside about using jamies is that they should have a better selection for breakfast for example there is only one cheese cheddar it is a nice cheese but there should be some choices e g cheese spreads feta cheese etc basically something else also there should be a bit more selection for people from the med such as olives black and green sliced cucumbers you can get these but you have to ask again all of these are just constructive criticism because the hotel is very nice and i would definitely stay there again
