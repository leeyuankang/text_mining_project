room particularly bathroom was a bit dirty when we arrived we found a pair of women shoes under the bed a clear sign that the room was not properly cleaned in addition the daily cleaning was very basic unacceptable for an hotel of this category such a pity because everything else was great my advice to the management is more attention to details having read the previous reviews it seems that the hotel managers don t really take comments on board not conductive to maintain grow the business listen to your customers please
