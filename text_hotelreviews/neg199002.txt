hotel called us about minutes before we were due to arrive by car to tell us they d had a problem with their system and we had to be moved to another hotel this wasn t any good as we booked the hotel specifically for a nearby business meeting so managed to get them to give us a room there upon complaining it was a smoking room so not great so overall pretty poor service for a hilton
