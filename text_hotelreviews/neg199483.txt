bit stingy with teabags milk but could get extra at reception on our last night i was kept awake all night i m not kidding all night there were doors banging shouting to one another in the corridor in out of lift area it stopped when they left at about but i was too anxious to sleep by then i went out to them at asked them to be quiet that was when i realised they were in room next to us she said what quite abruptly i asked again please be quiet she said ok then carried on doing the same i think they were leaving flying home to india or the like but they kept us up all night i rang down three times when they got to our floor it had all quietened down for about five minutes but the duty manager was gone when it started again when he came the last time the women from next door the man in the room opposite were going back into their rooms i went out this time voiced what had been going on all night in front of them i think the ma must have said they were leaving then i watched through my peephole as they went about ten minutes later when i asked for an extra hour the next morning so that we could shower pack as we had been up all night the night staff hadn t even left a message about it i was too upset dumbfounded to complain again that really was unfair completely spoiled our break so the hotel was great but in the scheme of things it doesn t matter
