service was quite poor and was completely over priced for what was on offer but due to the weekend adele the prices were put through the room for nights keys didn t work in lifts or stairs leaving us unable to get to our room several times then when finally reaching our room we were unable to get in due to the keys not working in the door reported several times to be told they worked each time having to be reset got a little tedious
