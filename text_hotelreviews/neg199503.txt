when i checked out i seemed to have been charged for water we didn t have anything from the mini bar when i said so the lady removed the charge but how did that happen the same two bottles that were in there when we arrived were still there also we booked without breakfast i think it was on the website so i considered that too much when i arrived we were offered it for that s a bit odd
