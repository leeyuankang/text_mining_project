the hotel television transmission is via the internet the signal was such that it was impossible to watch the television for the duration of my stay as the sound and picture quality were poor very frustrating as i felt out of touch with what was going on in the world the reading light was faulty and kept flickering so it was difficult to read in bed and by the time i found this it was too late to try to get it resolved
