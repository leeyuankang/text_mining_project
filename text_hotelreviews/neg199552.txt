there was an adjoining door to the next room which let in a little bit of noise from the guests there it also did not feel very secure perhaps a lock could be installed the door to the hallway was not soundproofed so one could easily be woken up by people talking in the coridoor finally it was hard to work out how to turn off the fan in the bathroom and it was noisy at night when trying to fall asleep
