breakfast time was mayhem all the hot breakfast items were empty and guests having to wait for a while for more to be cooked etc the bar in the evening was a long queue for people just coming in for a drink to let the train queue die down guests having to wait in line not acceptable but i emailed hotel and manager is going to rectify these issues
