the price charged for the room because it was the night of the billy joel concert was extortionate i appreciate i have a choice to book but my expectations were greater than the room that i was given i usually stay in the hilton which i much prefer and feel that it is worth the money but unfortunately it was sold out the minute i had booked the tickets on the day of release the standard of the room for the price paid executive room was disproportionate but appreciate that when in demand they can charge what they like
