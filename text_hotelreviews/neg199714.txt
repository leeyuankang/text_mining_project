concerts mean this hotel has a captive audience so they can charge you through the nose and give very average service knowing full well that the client has very little choice but to comply the hotel has the potential to be very good but the reception staff and particularly the bar breakfast management was abysmal the hotel was full after the springsteen concert so it is obvious that those clients will want a drink after a and a half hour performance how many people did the hotel put on bar duty that night two the result was a minute wait to get a drink with the hotel s own rude security guards not allowing guests to drink anything they had bought elsewhere even outside the front of the hotel same goes for breakfast a full hotel a stupidly narrow period for breakfast to be served finishing at means guess what all the guests arrived for breakfast at result absolute mayhem with staff rushed off their feet queues food drink constantly running out and loads of people complaining the worst breakfast experience i have ever had in a hotel it s not rocket science the management need shooting terrible value for money
