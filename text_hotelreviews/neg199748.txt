the breakfast was exceptionally poor after waiting over minutes for a table we waited a further minutes or more for teas and coffees and that was after i chased down the waiter the cooked breakfast was just about edible we waited minutes for the bacon to be cooked very poor the staff were polite in particular the gentleman who was front of house i visit and eat at the novotel in cardiff on a very regular basis and the food is far superior to the food served at your hotel
