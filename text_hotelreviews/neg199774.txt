check in very slow only two desks open when i arrived around pm used room service for an evening bottle of wine snack and waited a long time and i when it finally arrived it was not with a smile queue for breakfast next morning was so long we cancelled our breakfast reservation loads of empty tables but not enough staff on hand to direct guests no idea if it is always like that but odd that they could not cope with the numbers given how close they are to wembley arena room was comfortable glad we were on first floor as lifts were as slow as the staff they were happy to look after our luggage until the evening overall a mixed bag
