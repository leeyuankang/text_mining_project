the toilet paper was cheap not very soft even tescos basic t paper is better than this seemed penny pinching considering the cost of a night s stay is over i could not care less about having a large lcd tv it s the little details that make the difference especially regarding physical comfort the bed felt a little unsupportive and the pillows were too firm for my liking there was also grime in the centre of the shower head the main thing i noticed was the poor sound insulation between the room and the main corridor the door and the large gap underneath it let through too much noise the noise from other guests doors banging loudly in the early hours of friday night saturday morning meant i only got hours sleep when i stayed at the hilton hotel in wembley i found the room much quieter with no percerptible noise from other guests in the corridors based on my limited experience of the two i would choose hilton next time unless price was significantly cheaper at novotel that being said the novotel has a more friendly feel to it overall however due to quieter room i would choose the hilton given the choice
