not a major issue but i wanted to just use the desk lamp to do some work at the desk without disturbing my wife who had gone to bed but the only way to have the desk lamp switched on is to have all the main lights in the room switched on a very odd light switching arrangement not sure if deliberate for some reason of if incorrectly wired when the system was installed i could not move the floor standing lamp stand over to the desk to plug into the socket behind the desk because the lamp stand has an old fashioned s stle round pin pin plug which won t fit the square pin socket behind desk again very odd electrics
