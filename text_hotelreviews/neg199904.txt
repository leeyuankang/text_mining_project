security alarm in room went off at asking us to evacuate the building immediately not the usual fire alarm and was instead a automated voice saying something along the lines of a serious incident has happened and we need to immediately evacuate at the same time the electricity in the room had stopped working so we were in darkness terrified and unsure of what the hell was going on eventually we found out that it was due to someone having a shower in the hotel and the steam had set this alarm off i was very nearly standing outside in my underwear so this in summary was not the best experience the staff didn t apologise either housekeeping arrived about after they were called to fix our broken electricity
