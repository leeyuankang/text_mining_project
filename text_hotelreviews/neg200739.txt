we stay for four nights breakfast are included we are three people and comes to the same table at a few minute apart we have to keep asking things that they should provide like water milk for tea if you don t asks they will not give another pot of tea for second or third person but we could hear they talk and talk in the kitchen and a few time we have to go approach them for services it is such a shame it is a lovely hotel and great location
