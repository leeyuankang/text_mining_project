i had asked for a quiet room as i am a very light sleeper and was given a back room facing the inner stone square which was lovely and quiet for all but the last night of my stay as bad luck had it that s when the next door neighbor decided to throw a dancing party until then i wasn t aware that my bathroom wall marked the limit of the hotel and that the next apartment belonged to a regular paris old building no isolation in retrospect it seems safer to ask for a room facing the street which isn t very noisy to begin with
