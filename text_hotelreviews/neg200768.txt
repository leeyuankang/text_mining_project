breakfast was disappointing with very limited choice and not worth the charge eggs and bacon ran out an hour before the official end of breakfast time i mentioned this politely to a member of staff and asked if any more would be forthcoming he shrugged and replied non c est fini no it s finished and that was that some of the hotel decor is over the top for my taste a lot of glitter but i accept this is a matter of personal taste and not a big deal for me also i prefer a shower one can stand under without having to hold it theirs can only be fixed at waist height or hand held
