we booked a package with breakfasts but got charged for the price difference between continental and buffet breakfasts the staff told us there are two kinds of breakfast and the package we booked only covers continental and since we had buffet we had to pay the difference this was never mentioned in bookings coom and caused unexpected confusion the food is so so not much variety either
