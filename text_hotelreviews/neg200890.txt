the fact that the bathroom toilette is in a separate room than the main bathroom that has the washing basin and the bathtub which was not very practical or comfortable since you have to go from one room to another to wash your hands after using it if you are not staying with a close person this may become an issue especially if you are the kind who prefers to wash your hands before you pull up your pants just joking lol
