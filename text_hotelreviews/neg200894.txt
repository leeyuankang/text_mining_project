the receptionist did not agree for early check in although the rooms were available and i requested this early they promised upon availability also she asked me the credit card and i told her to charge the amount from the same amount reserved on time of reservation she promised to do that but she reserved another amount on the time of check out her colleague informed me that she don t need to do that because the amount reserved in reservation is enough you know while traveling you don t want extra reserving with your credit card
