had asked for quiet room booked a deluxe king size room and was told it would be on one of the upper floors and over the garden i e quiet on arrival told we had an upgrade to much larger room etc this was on floor and over entrance on main road was awake from due to people loudly arguing outside and earlier traffic noise gave disturbed sleep position of dining room in basement see what did you like comments on request was given a new room in terms of original booking which was very quiet on floor overlooking garden did feel that a day of our holiday was lost was this a genuine upgrade or due to lack of available room as per booking two electric bulbs not working hence poor lighting and bath plug didn t work hence no bath sink plug didn t work but we repaired that room size very adequate and comfortable which would have been enhanced by a second easy chair turn down service a nice touch but why only on nights a drawer on bedside table would be useful
