we are usually traveling to paris times a year for business and leisure we have stayed in much smaller hotels typical of paris too but our stay at warwick was our worst ever stay in the last years the name is too big for this hotel with zero standard we were in a deluxe room with extremely dirty curtains walls and bathroom the curtain walls and ceiling had dirt marks of insect killed on them that were not removed the phones in the room were not working the pop up blockers in bathtub and wash basin could not be opened but to be removed on night my wife was screaming of seeing a coackroach in the bathroom we complained about hygiene and poor condition of room the next morning in the afternoon we noticed the cleaners had not properly vacuumed and cleaned the room and even intentionally left bunches of hairs on table wash basin and bed so rude even scattered our slippers on the floor after our complain and opposition we were moved to an executive room which was a bit less outdated but strangely the cleaning and room maintain service was completely different in our night stay we could finally sleep night a bit comfortable the breakfast dishes are mostly dirty with food and oil stains this hotel is suffering of a serious hygiene issues i do not recommend this hotel to anyone expecting stay in a starred hotel it can be a cheap dirty hostel
