i don t think the staff was very welcoming or nice actually when we arrived there were of us because one of my kids was staying with my mom in another hotel but i wanted to check in first since the room was only for three they were claiming that we were and not and although i let them know my older son was not staying in the hotel they were doubtful about it and rude they cleaned our room very late although we usually would go out before overall it was clean but the toilet had stains it is old but they need to change it because it looks dirty we left glasses with water or juice and when we came back they were still there the cleaning lady would not take them away which is also not very thoughtful or clean
