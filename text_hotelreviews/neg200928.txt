the service in the restaurant should improved when the breakfast buffet almost closed since staff took away my dishes and spoon when i need to eat the fruit on the table i need to take another spoon from buffet area but the staff just told me buffet are closed i noticed the time and wasn t going to take any food in the buffet area but they didn t known guest s intention and thought i want to take food plus the food was still there which made me very uncomfortable i wish service really need to be improved if hotel wants to have good reputation and sustainable development in hotel industry
