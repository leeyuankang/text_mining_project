only complaint is we asked for an iron and it never came had to ask again and that time they brought it to the room very minor complaint given the rest of the experience at this hotel the location is great to get around the city but champs elysees doesn t offer many great affordable food choices within walking distance most of the restaurants cafes are either outrageously expensive or not very good suggest researching and venturing out of the area for that
