if you want check in early make sure that the hotel will take an advantage of you in my case the receptionist sofia almost forced me to upgrade my room for the whole stay to benefit from the early check in and the discounted rate of the upgrade although when i checked online i found availability of room the same type of my original booking and also i found a cheaper rate for the upgraded room the receptionist claimed it was discounted rooms facing the street are very noisey because of the night club near the hotel internet signal is weak in the room my honest opinion is to book in california champs ely ees hotel
