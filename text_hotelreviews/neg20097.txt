my only complaint would be that dogs are welcome in the rooms and tea room but not in the restaurant it would be nice if the hotel was pet friendly across the board rather than only in some areas other pet friendly hotels in london such as the milestone do this so it would be wonderful if well behaved dogs who are hotel guests are welcome everywhere
