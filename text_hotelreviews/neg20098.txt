i didn t like that we were in a room that had lots of adaptations for a person with a disability nothing was mentioned when we checked in room nice size room though lots of grab rails and emergency cords hanging my sister has a disability and uses a wheelchair this would have been perfect for her and her husband there was no switch for the fan in the bathroom in the bar at night we ordered drinks and they were never brought it was a little late but it was like they were forgotten the night before we ordered food in the bar and had to send a burger back as it was raw inside and very undercooked overall i was a little disappointed really for the cost of our stay
