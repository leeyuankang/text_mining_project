the room was appalling i had originally requested a room with a balcony as a special request and i understand that may not always be possible in saying that they gave me a room in the basement supposedly it was a bonus gift from them as it was a bigger room to what i had originally booked which made me think how small could my room have been if this so called bigger room was this small there was a window with three magnificent view of the buildings pipe work there was a constant noise out the window from a machine of some sort there was not much room to hang clothes or put things away there was a tiny built in wardrobe which could barely fit a handful of tops but the room was for i will not be staying here again
