the change of hotel story it repeated with every gusts so i have reviewed some of gust comments before and i faced the same if you booked a room for three adult which is queen bed and sofa beds you will stay in the basement which i will not recommend so the only room fit adult is in the basement otherwise they move you up in room with extra bed for non adult the room pic dose not match the reality
