everything was great i ordered breakfast the night before leaving the paper hanging on the door as instructed the breakfast was not delivered in the am but it worked out fine for me i wasn t even going to mention it but i wanted to order again a few days later and explained that i no longer had the paper needed to order they immediately came to my room and took it from me personally to make sure the order would be taken care of they apologized profusely and then returned with complimentary champagne that was the only blip but it only served to show that they have good customer service
