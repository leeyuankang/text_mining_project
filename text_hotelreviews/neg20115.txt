there were two drawbacks firstly there were no grips to get in and out of the bath so i could not take a bath and it was very dangerous getting in and out of the bath just to take a shower i am no longer young the other thing is that the bar and restaurant is in a basement and i have never seen that in any other good hotel and may account for why there was never anyone there i certainly am not going to eat in a basement at a or star hotel
