the hotel manager was not happy that we didn t want to eat breakfast in the hotel euro person it was our first day in paris and we wanted to go out and explore and eat in a parisian cafe we ended up eating breakfast there one morning because the manager basically told us we were rude for not eating breakfast there after they upgraded our room from classic to deluxe for our anniversary stay the deluxe room was quite small so i am sure the classic room would be even smaller for perspective there s just enough room to stand in the restroom between the shower and the toilet and the vanity sink is right next to the bed our room faced the street which had several bars around it there were people talking yelling and laughing in the street until in the morning which made for difficult sleep i saw several people rate this as a star hotel but this is not comparable to a usa star hotel in my opinion
