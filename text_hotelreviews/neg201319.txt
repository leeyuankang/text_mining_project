i picked this restaurant on the basis of two key points a bathtub and a good breakfast there is not a single bathtub in the entire hotel even though its advertised as such on booking com when i complained i was told by the check in desk that bath means shower and when i argued that she is incorrect she dismissed my point saying that she is right the breakfast was different cuts of ham which both my wife and i do not eat cheese selection breads and cereal no variation and no hot cooked items
