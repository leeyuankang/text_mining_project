i had a superior room but many things were missing like a big mirror a bedside table soap in the shower a bathtub a bin under the super tiny desk or a bottle opener it s way too expensive for what is really is and they charge euros for a simple breakfast you don t even have eggs only one kind of bread pastries are not the best and fruits are limited the cheese and ham were delicious though
