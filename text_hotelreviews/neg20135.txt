the room turned out smaller than i expected but i didn t dwell on this fact because i did book the room online and the images could be deceiving what my main issue is and what left me utterly speechless was the lack of trustworthy staff this hotel employed i left my ring in my room s table i put it in the same spot every night and when i remembered after coming back to the hotel it disappeared i decided to not assume the worst and looked everywhere but there was no sign of it so i decided to speak to the reception and ask for their help to check which members of staff entered cleaned the room the response which left me utterly shocked was when i asked them to check cctv and they replied that they would but that s assuming someone from outside the hotel somehow entered my room and took the ring they didn t want to question any of their staff at least the ones who entered the room because they wanted to give their own employees the benefit of the doubt i understand that employers must protect their employees but what if that compromises the customers experience my primary issue was the ring that was stolen which has a lot of sentimental value linked to it but it s certainly a matter of trust now you d expect the hotel to contact you even if they didn t find the ring and the issue they claimed to look into but guess what no one has contacted me ever since it s been a month even to apologise i m writing this review not to express my anger only but to warn other customers from a hotel which clearly has their customers at the bottom of their priority list
