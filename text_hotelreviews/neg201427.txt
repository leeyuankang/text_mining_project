the hotel is really tiny the elevator cannot fit more than person the reception is non existent do not take the breakfast option as it is located in an underground cave with very poor food options finally do not be fooled by the pictures as the rooms are extremely small we had to pack our stuff in the wardrobes because you can t fit one open suitcase in the room and still be able to walk the bathroom is also very very small although it contains everything you need
