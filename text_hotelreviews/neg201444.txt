the room was tiny compared to how the picture made it look the tv only had french channels despite according to the room information leaflet having english channels the telephone in our room did not work we could not phone receiption or anyone and reception could not phone us meaning the receptionist had to come and knock on our door the reception was left unmanned and we walked in with no one to question us making it seem unsafe and anyone could walk in and use the lift to the rooms the stairs on the first floor had no carpet and i understand there to be some work happening to them however the smell of what i assume to be alcohol based solvent ran through the while hotel the receptionists were friendly and spoke good english
