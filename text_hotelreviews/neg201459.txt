our room faced a small street and i was worried about street noise during the day yes honking cars trucks mainly traveling to local businesses at night it calmed down considerably the twin beds room boudoir was small no drawers just some shelf space here and there we basically lived out of luggage the whole time irritated me at first but after a day i got used to it good that there was an expandable luggage tray to make it easier and plastic chairs to put stuff on smaller rooms are common for hotels in a convenient location at a decent price in a touristy european location simple but quaint view from floor seeing terraces mini roof garden but opening windows during day just brought in hamburger smells from restaurant across the street not really ideal teeny tiny sliver elevator seemed modern but small it only comfortably holds adults maybe bigger carry on luggage or adult big checked in bag you get used to it or you can take the carpeted spiralling stairway for daily up and down travel interesting that there s a motif of marie antoinette on mirror inside if you look closely
