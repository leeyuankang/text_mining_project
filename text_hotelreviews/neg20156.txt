staff were a mixed bag to be honest on arriving back at the hotel after night out we couldn t get into our rooms as the system had advised we d checked out i was then questioned and queried by the night staff and made to feel like it was my problem and not the hotel s i had to wait over minutes for keys to be re programmed to gain entry to the room not much sympathy from the duty manager the next day this was the only bad thing but did leave a cloud over our stay the lady that we checked in with and checked out with however was a delight
