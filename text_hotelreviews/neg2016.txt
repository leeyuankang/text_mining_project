our rooms were in underground floor it s nothing specifically bad but was not mentioned during booking unstable wi fi signal in the room but still working the worst part is tiny bathroom it combines toilet and shower on a very small patch and if you are not alone after one person takes a shower everything around like floor toilet is absolutely wet
