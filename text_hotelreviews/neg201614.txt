the ad said bedroom which was the reason why i had booked it but in reality it was more like i ordered in room dining which took more than hour to be delivered while i was asked to spend more than i had originally planned turned into a minimum order and was even charged a supplement for a past order without being informed the toilet smelled like gutter and the bathtub wasn t cleaned properly hair sticking on the walls when i asked for an umbrella at the reception as it was pouring rain outside they told me there is no such service as though i was requesting something totally extraordinary
