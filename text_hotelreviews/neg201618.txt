the wifi was literally unusable a stingy and illogical internet policy that logs you out every hours and takes about min to login again continually fumbling with passwords login screens etc when finally logged in its dead slow i found the internet experience unbearable in this hotel given that there is barely a signal you are left with no option but to suffer this experience sort it out such a wonderful place what a pity to have something as commoditised as the internet ruin a stay
