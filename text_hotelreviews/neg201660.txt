we were double booked for the first night i had booked months in advance so this was slightly annoying disappointing to receive an email only a couple of days prior to departure informing us that we had been offered a place in the sister hotel we met other couuples this had happened to this hotel based on peruvian design had the feel of a nightclub everything very dark and although everything in our room was high spec our windows opened onto a very noisy road which kept us awake all night this was a hotel of acquired taste our luggage was transferred by the hotel but it would have been nice to have had free breakfast for example for the inconvenience
