this was our second stay at villa beaumarchais this month our first just the two of us was excellent this time we needed extra space as one of our adult sons was arriving in paris and staying overnight as well so we booked a junior suite it cost a fair bit extra but really was little if any larger than the earlier room having the toilet separate from the bathroom was good but overall it was a let down relatively speaking
