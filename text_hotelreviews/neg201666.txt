we had to clean the bath out before we used it as it still had hair and dirt in it from the people who were there before us the walls were covered in marks and the wardrobe doors had piece of wood missing had been broken off it was a bit scruffy especially for the price we paid per night the wifi didn t work in the room which was frustrating i would say this was a two star hotel a member of staff also over charged us for our drinks and we were given coupons for complimentary drinks which we weren t able to use as the cocktail maker was never there we were not offered a substitute i wouldn t stay here again
