my stay started during one of the july heat waves and unfortunately the air conditioning system was down for a few days but all in all it was ok as there were electric floor fans available the hotel contacted me one day before my arrival offering a full refund because of the broken a c that had just occurred but i had not time to find another hotel so i kept my booking the room was quite big but a bit old fashioned furbished and the bathroom tub had poor sanitary joints attached to the wall
