we had a beautiful shower only to find out we had no bath towels in our room and the reception phone number was no where to be found we awkwardly had to go down to reception and ask for towels where we were treated as if we were lying or stole the towels this is particularly humiliating standing wet in a robe the man also only gave us one bath towel one hand towel which meant two trips to reception to collect another towel they were very apologetic the next day and all other staff were fantastic i hope this was just a one off unfortunate occasion
