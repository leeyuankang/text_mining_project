there were no available plugs the only way to charge your cell phone tablet or laptop was the get down on your hands and knees unplug a lamp and charge the devices one at a time this is a very easy fix and the hotel should do it also the wifi was not working at all well when i was there and i saw a number of guests coming down for help confused and disgruntled also breakfast at euros is most definitely not worth the money walk down to a nearby cafe for coffee and croissants or something better
