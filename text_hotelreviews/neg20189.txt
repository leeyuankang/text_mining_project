luggage space in the room as you d expect london hotel rooms are slightly smaller and me travelling from australia with a large suitcase was a bit of a struggle where to place it so i don t trip over it as it didn t fit in the wardrobe but that was a minor thing the room was on the ground floor so i could hear the underground going so next time i will request a room on the upper floors as i am a light sleeper
