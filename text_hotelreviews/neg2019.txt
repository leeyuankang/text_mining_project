it s very close to another hotel with almost the same name so we went to the wrong one first not really their fault checking in was very chaotic it was very busy some people had been double booked also when we went to check in at one of the rooms wasn t ready as they had a late check out which i didn t think was a very good excuse the hotel was ok but it was expensive for what you got it s the location you re paying for
