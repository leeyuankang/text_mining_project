small bed definitely not large as stated in the room s description no iron should be according to my room s descripton mediocre breakfasts the biggest dissapointment the view on montmartre which you can find while browsing hotel s photo on booking com website is only available from some of hotel s rooms so don t expect you ll be eating breakfasts on the hotel s terrace and looking at sacre coeur unless you book the proper suite
