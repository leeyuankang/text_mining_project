power cut on the first night despite the two cafes either side still having full power no lifts no lights in the room so couldn t use the bathroom as it was windowless no apology from the staff we asked how to use the safe a staff member was promised to visit our room but he she never materialised so completely wasted our time very expensive breakfast at euros per person across the road we got two hot baguettes fruit fruit juice and tea for half that price paris was lovely the hotel was awful will not be using holiday inn again
