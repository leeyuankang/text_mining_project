the hotel doesn t respect the terms and conditions described at booking com as they imposed me to pay for an extra room cause we were two adults and two young little children although my kids were under the age that is allowed to stay for free as quoted below free all children under years stay free of charge for children s cots cribs free all children under years stay free of charge for extra beds and that s what i did exactly i booked a room and asked for an extra bed but when arrived at the hotel the answer was sorry we can t accommodate you in one room but when i said that is as per your terms and conditions when i booked the room they told me that those condition are not applicable any more when i asked to see the responsible person he didn t want to even walk out of his office which is a very very very bad attitude from the top person of the hotel so imagine the rest of the staff although also i had a loyalty member ship with this brand of hotels also this didn t give me and advantage i would like to also request booking com to review the t c s so people wont get in a situation like the one the that i ve been through please post every word i said
