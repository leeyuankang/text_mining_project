the area is crowded with too many people small local shops that aren t the kind you want to be a tourist at its noisy all the time and most things shut very early with the exception of street side bars unlike a lot of the other places in paris they don t place a kettle in your room and other amenities along with towels bed room slippers bath robes and hot water for tea were either out of stock or took too long to be sent to our room the standard room for people is too tight and might be fine for one person if you re going to paris and you want to have a pleasant time book a place in a more touristy area so the places around you stay open and is a safe place even at night also be very careful about your belongings everywhere holed your bag to your heart
