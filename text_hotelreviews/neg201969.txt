the hotel is situated at a place very close to the train station but very unsafe because my purse containing all my belongings passports all cash euros swiss francs aed emirates i d s credit card camera watch iphone etc was stolen within seconds when i was talking to the receptionist in the hotel lobby at the time of checkout the hotel personnel refused to take any credibility refused to show the cctv footage tried to tear the police report on the pretext of taking photocopies for us i still have the torn copies even telling the indian consulate that this did not happen in the hotel i am pretty sure that the hotel staff is in collusion with the thieves as the receptionist saw what was happening as there was no else around me at that time it was a terrible experience and i do not want anyone else facing the same please be very careful staying in this hotel
