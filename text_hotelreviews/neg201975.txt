i didn t like that the hotel had a failure of their hvac during a record heat wave i didn t like that their only option for relief was one of five fans available for the entire hotel obviously i wasn t one of the lucky or quick ones and had to endure a room that was degrees that may have been ok if i could open my window to let air in i did and until nearly in the morning got to listen to the dance clubs and drunks from the massive station across the street one of my colleagues while enduring the opressive heat also woke up to ants crawling on him in his bed the hotel management refused to speak to our group and the rest of the staff was terribly rude i also didn t like the fact that staff kept telling us the air was fixed when degrees on the top floor of the hotel clearly proved it wasn t lastly having to change hotels in the middle of my trip doesn t rank at the top of things i like about this terrible hotel my advice if you re looking for a place to stay where staff treats you as a guest and not as if they re extending you a great privilege by letting you have a room go elsewhere
