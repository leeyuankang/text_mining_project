we had a tiny room that was nothing like the size of the room shown on the booking com website the breakfast situation is a joke the dining room is far too small the food runs out on our second day we waited and waited for a table when we finally got one we went to get our breakfast of which the hotel had run out of croissants meat and the tropicana juice only to return to the table to find someone else sat down so we ended up taking a cup of coffee and a danish each up to the room hardly a great breakfast i asked for at tray to take food up to the room and wasn t given one we ended up at mcdonalds down the road one hour later the phone in the room doesn t tell you how to dial out or reception etc so you end up having to walk down to reception there is apparently wifi in the hotel but nobody ever gave us the code there can be long queues at checkout there can be queues at check in and although there is supposed to be priority check in for loyalty card holders there aren t enough staff on reception to cope with this i would not stay again primarily due to the breakfast situation sorry
