it was difficult to find the number for the reception room service and or other services in the hotel as the telephone did not indicate which one was which unfortunately i had a bitter end to my stay as i had trouble after leaving the hotel i remembered that i accidentally left behind jewelry in the safe box and that i had not emptied it correctly and left behind a necklace i contacted the hotel almost hours later but they had no report of my missing necklace from their housekeeping staff the person responsible for lost and found was very helpful and assured me that they will investigate the issue it s definitely my responsibility for forgetting to take it but i feel that it could have been easily found had staff promptly reported the item left behind by a guest
