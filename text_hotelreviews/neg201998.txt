reception staff rude disinterested was not acknowledged at all whilst standing at the desk as the receptionist changed the paper in the credit card machine for a good minutes rooms not as requested told we had interconnecting rooms but one had a door to adjoining room on the other side to the room we were given changed to rooms on opposite side of hotel as no adjacent rooms were available one room was large spacious other was tiny could barely get around the side of the bed the windows didn t open and lacking toiletries on checkout i asked the difference with the rooms assuming they were of different standards and was ignored broken light fixture broken kettle which tripped the electricity no kettle in one room never rectified despite assurances also no baby cot despite a request prior to arrival i feel this hotel could be so much better simply by a different attitude from the reception staff and some attention to detail from housekeeping staff
