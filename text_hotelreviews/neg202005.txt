room was perhaps small worst thing is there is no universal plug point for the mobiles and laptops to be charged unfortunately when checked with reception the answer was no proper i had to wait for the next morning for the shops to open and get stuffs charged instead you may need to change plug points as most people visit as tourists and if not atleast provide with suitable adaptors to fit the charging equipments i couldnt charge mobile phones cameras laptops and the next day plan was almost flopped
