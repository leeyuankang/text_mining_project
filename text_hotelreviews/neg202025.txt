we arrived and paris was having a heatwave and the aircon was not working at the hotel but they did not tell us when we checked in when it was unbearable to be in our room because the sun was blasting in and so hot i asked if we could be moved there response was no and shrugging of shoulders they really could not have cared less told them it was about customer service and they should have advised us before checking in asked when the aircon would be fixed and was told from one staff member weeks and the other one said may anyway in the end i had to call booking com for assistance to which they had to talk with the hotel to get some action in the end the lovely michael advised that they couldn t do anything for us for the night but tomorrow they could move us if only someone would have responded pleasantly in the first place and offered a solution the situation could have been so different and i would not have been so upset by how the staff reacted i must say the staff is hit and miss some are lovely and friendly and the others are just rude then there is the location this would be the main reason i would not go back again we did not feel safe walking around of a night time or catching the metro home to the gare d lest did speak to one of the staff at hotel and asked about walking around or coming home on metro to the station of a night time and he said he did not recommend it really was unpleasant and a bit off putting if you do stay when you walk out of the hotel and turn right it is a little better than turning left after being in london and travelling on underground late at night and walking back to apartment and feeling safe it was very different here in paris lots of beggars streets are dirty and smelly we did not enjoy our time in paris at all
