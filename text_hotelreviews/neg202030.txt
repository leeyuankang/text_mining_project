almost everything the room we took smelled so bad when we further checked it was the problem of the sink that kept the water blocked inside it a guy came and removed this cover of the hole of the sink to make water run which happened but so slowly and we had to wait a lot of time for every time we were washing our hands then the air conditioner was not working and the air inside the room was still smelling bad and suffocating so we called them again they promised to come and then they did not show up we asked to exchange the room and they refused claiming that they do not have any extra rooms and everything is fully booked then we found plaster containing blood in the basket the knob of the air conditioner was broken and we could not turn it on or do anything the staff was so rude talking to us too about exchanging the room
