well within being there for minutes me and my partner went downstairs to get the wifi passcode and succeeding so we went back in the elevator lift and went in the very end one as we pressed the button it jolted and wouldn t move so we pressed again not thinking anything of it and it shot straight up to the floor when we pressed for the and then wouldn t open or moved we was stuck for hour and had no reassurance of getting out there was a few hello s exchanged from the other side assuming from staff but the staff didn t actually get to us for at least minutes we was with other strangers in the lift who spoke german so there was no way to communicate eventually we got out yes but i did not feel compensated for and when we got out the lift there was no staff to greet us to make sure we was okay or to check which i was really disappointed with and suffering from anxiety this was not the best never the less we did speak to the manager who is a pleasant man but only made a note on my booking saying that i was stuck in a lift that was it no compensation for what had happened which is very scary adult or not and leaving the hotel i spoke to a lovely lady who showed me a computer i could use to say we was leaving yet it said i still had to pay which i had already payed for causing me to stress over and i had to really persuade her to double check that it hadn t been paid because i know it had but she kept insisting i would have had a receipt and then after me slightly loosing my temper she finally checked in which i was right but still had to pay for tax why i should have at least got this for free after everything
