we use this hotel very often for its location is comfortable for us one of the main reasons that we choose it was that we had tea pot in the room so we could drink tea in the evening but this time there was no tea pot in the room and when we asked for it the receptionist refused to do that being quite unloyal that is why we give lower estimate of the hotel this time the tea pot should be in the room
