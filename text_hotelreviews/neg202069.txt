we booked an executive room but the heating wasn t working ok these things happen but we had to ask times for someone to have a look at it when they couldn t fix it we were moved to a cheaper room smaller with twin beads at a junction so quite noisy we did get a refund at the end to bring our pre payment in line with the cheaper room rate but they were not aware at the desk we had to spend time explaining what had happened no apology was offered we were asked wasn t a similar value room available well how would we know presumably not or you would have offered it we ve stayed at the hotel before without problem but it has put us off from re booking we re in paris twice a year on business usually book a couple of rooms we know things go wrong but felt it could have been dealt with in a better way after we d been moved on our first night no one mentioned it as we re occupied all day for business didn t really have the time or inclination to ask about moving again to a better room as it was too much bother for us to have to pack up all our things move again what i would have expected if the same or a better room was not available was that at least someone would explain this apologise
