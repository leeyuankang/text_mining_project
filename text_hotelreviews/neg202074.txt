overall i had a terrible experience here as i had my purse stolen from the hotel reception while collecting my luggage there is no security whatsoever everyone can come in and out of the reception from the street and while the location is convenient close to the train station it is also one of the rougher areas of paris so some form of security is a must some ideas have someone supervising the door at the very least and a door that stays closed unless someone buzzes you in
