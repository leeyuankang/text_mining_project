weird but the toilets were very high i am and was on my very tippy toes when seated on the toilet which is very uncomfortable as it turns out i found the staff while not rude weren t welcoming either out toilet blocked and the staff member who dealt with it was not terribly decisive she was you can move rooms if we can find you one in the end we did and the moved was a significant improvement our first room was little more than a cupboard with barely enough room to get to either side of the bed overall it was ok for two people but our second room gave us room for our bags and to move about a bit too much nicer both rooms had unfinished plaster work and lack of attention to detail that i would have expected better from a chain hotel like the holiday inn
