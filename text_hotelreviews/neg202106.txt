staff was not friendly it took over an hour and two phone calls to front desk for a remote to television because there wasn t one in the room i asked for a taxi and one was supposedly called but never arrived when booking i requested a late checkout but on departure date no one knew what i was talking about despite an email confirming the request luckily the one woman on staff on october at had sense to honor the request to allow me to retrieve my luggage from room
