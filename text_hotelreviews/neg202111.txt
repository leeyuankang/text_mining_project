it is noisy especially on a saturday night if you have a room on the street the area is a little seedy but very handy to the metro and the two main train stations easy walking distance if you travel by eurostar staff pleasant although we did miss out on visiting versailles because the receptionist didn t tell us it wasn t open on mondays despite us telling him it was our plan to visit on monday when we booked the other tours we went to chantilly instead which was fantastic so everything worked out ok
