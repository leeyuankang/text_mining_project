there was no outlet in the bathroom for a hairdryer or flat iron i had to stand in a poorly lit hallway looking at a mirror on the closet door to do my hair there was an outlet in the closet the duvet on the bed was lightweight but very warm and even with the heat turned down in the room i woke up every night feeling hot no other blanket or top sheet was available
