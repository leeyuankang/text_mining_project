the reseptionist was very rude and ignorant they have minor capability of communicating properly with the customers there was a cockroach in our room one night and it was extremely disturbing we sensed that the hotel was very dirty for that reason and it was not possible to sleep with calm in the night because of this happening we had to kill the bug and throw it away they have also told us that the rooms are for people but it wasnt true we were and we had to stay in a room with bed one night it was vey bad service as they have said they couldnt do anything because the room was too small to put an extra bed inside the reception and the manager even offered to put an extra bed without a frame just the mattress itself on the floor we told him that it is not possible and this suggestion is humiliating in the meantime
