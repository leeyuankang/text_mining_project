i asked for my breakfast at it was delivered at it was delivered without a top over the hot plate so that the hot plate was actually luke warm the breakfast to the room is mediocre and they really need to source better sausages than the plastic muck on the plate i tried ringing room service twice and they did not pick up the woman at reception checking me in was unfocused and distracted totally not concentrated on checking me in and far too slow with all actions she also did not act on my email request for late check out so i had to come back down once i remembered this had not been done
