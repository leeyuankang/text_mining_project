our airconditioning was not working therefore we changed rooms that day unfortunately the airconditioner was not working in the room we moved to either we asked for someone to come up to check the airconditioner and acted as if we were crazy luckily the next morning i spoke with someone at the front desk and he had assured it was fixed by the time we got back there were also ants crawling on the floor and a very big bug ran behind our beds just before we went to bed
