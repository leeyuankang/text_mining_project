staff was very uncooperative we had no problem staying in a small room with kids but they forced us to get a bigger room and pay twice as much then they put us in a room where a c didn t work upon asking we were told that they couldn t do anything about it until the next day had to approach the higher ups who finally put us back in a smaller room but still charged the same double amount use this hotel as a last resort
