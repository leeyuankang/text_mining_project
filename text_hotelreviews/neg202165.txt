definitely not value for money for a star hotel i have stayed in better stars the expectation was too much due to being holiday inn however i believe that i didn t get what i expected the room space was pretty tight for a double room also the breakfast was the same items of food everyday there was a kettle in the room however i had to ask for tea bags and cups everyday and as well as this the room was not cleaned properly i booked three rooms and found that two of the three rooms didn t have a kettle i had looked at other stars before booking this hotel but i only went for holiday inn due to the brand name i must say the service provided was satisfactory
