we did not enjoy the staff very much the stewardess woke us up every morning asking for service even when the do not disturb sign was hanging on the door the reception staff was not very professional we stayed over four days and nobody told us about breakfast hours it s a good idea to have late breakfast during the weekend however you should inform your guests upon check in we paid our breakfast in advance and lost a day because of this money was reimbursed however it s still annoying when check out receptionist told us we still have to pay for our breakfast ridiculous communication has to improve this is embarrassing and could be easily avoid
