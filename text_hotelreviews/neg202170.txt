all room was too small and dirty we had requested while booking weeks before that we are travelling with small children and we need interconnecting rooms but on arrival the staff informed that interconnecting rooms are not available so we had to take two adjusant rooms and to our utter dismal in one of the rooms there were may white ants the first day we checked in when they changed the room after complain the new room was very far from our other room for kids and the staff informed that they cannot find any thing better the breakfast was very limited and repeated throughout our days stay i must say that holiday inn standards have dropped and this hotel is over rated housekeeping was terrible housekeeping didn t bother to replace toiletries throughout our stay and never cleaned the carpet which was badly soiled it was terrible stay in a beautiful city
