unfortunately i booked on line and made an error with the date and booked the wrong week upon arriving at the hotel bags in hand at in the afternoon the male receptionist was quiet happy to take a copy of our passports credit card payment and have me sign the necessary documentation to check in before advising me i was booked in for the following week and that there were no rooms available that night also that he couldn t help me any further and to ring booking com if we required assistance booking com did the best they could for us given it was an obvious error but to no avail whilst they had days to re let the room the hotel refused to give a refund there was a manager on duty who arranged another room for us at a motel nearby which we appreciated as by this time it was getting late and we were both exhausted a lesson learnt and two very expensive nights in paris
