sadly this is where we felt the highlights ended for us we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and although we were left a gesture in the room the service we expected was far below average i called down to reception to advise that we had opened the balcony door and could not shut it so if someone could have a look at it and whilst they were heading up could they provide ironing facilities the room was not looked at for several hours even though it was pretty cold and when they did arrive no ironing facilities were provided i called down to reception to advise not to worry however i would like the bluetooth code to connect to the media system to which i was told they did not know what it was but someone would call me to let me know again i was let down and no call was received i quickly overlooked these things as the time came for us to head down to a pre booked dinner in the restaurant for our anniversary the restaurant is in the lower grounds of the hotel we arrived at a little earlier than our reservation however the waiter was happy to seat us early we asked for a drinks menu so we could order a bottle of wine and decided to order some olives whilst waiting for the food menu minutes passed and still no food menu minutes later and after asking once already the food menu it finally arrived hour and minutes later and no wine left in the bottle we decided that clearly no one was interested in taking our food order again after asking waiters if we could be served finally we got someone s attention which turned out to be the manager and he was very quick to apologise and as a gesture agreed to cover the cost of our olives and did not apply a service charge how spoilt did we feel we had noticed we were not the only people facing difficulties as a gentlemen sat opposite had to ask for cutlery twice as his food sat in front of him getting cold in all honestly for the money sadly we won t be returning
