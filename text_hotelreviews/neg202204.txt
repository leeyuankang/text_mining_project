room was very small and the air condition did not work had horrible nights at the hotel without the air condition working as the staff could not arrange an alternative room due to full occupancy at the hotel i was expecting a compensation from the hotel but that didn t happen as well not the usual thing that happens with holiday inn stay very disappointed
