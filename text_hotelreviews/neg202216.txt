rooms are extremely small the room had one bed and we still were barely able to get our one large suitcase that we shared in the room to open the bag we had to open it on the bed i m american so it may be different in other countries but i have never been in a hotel room this small there is no reason to stay in a room this small if you re college aged stay in a more expensive room and split the cost if you can afford to then just go somewhere else with a bigger room for your own sanity
