the hotel receptionist did not respond to my request and seems to take things for granted i requested a room sandal but it was not there when i arrived i requested again when i check in but the receptionist asked me to check in the room yet the sandal was not there so i have to ask again i have requested the receptionist two times and december to fix the safe deposit box which was locked hence i cannot use it as i arrive in the evening it was still locked the next day i asked the same but it was not also fixed please pay attention to guests request especially since it were normal requests
