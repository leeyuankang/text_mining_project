on business i have stayed in many hotels so feel able to review constructively the rooms were the smallest i have stayed in although clean the carpets were dirty and stained and no kettle was available although tea and coffee facilities were in place when is asked for a kettle i was told there was not enough available then advised to leave my room and go to the bar on ground floor and ask for hot water if this hotel was a a night stay totally fine but for a night not acceptable the breakfast buffet was very basic and again not worth the additional cost plenty of nice cafes in the area
