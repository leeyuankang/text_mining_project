room was extremely small with very strange walk in wardrobe space i feel the layout of the room and the dark wood did not help not good if you are claustrophobic also as we were in an internal room we were unable to open the windows bathroom tiny but adequate with a fantastic shower anyone of a larger build would struggle to move around in there i would suggest a taxi from the station or underground if you have any luggage as its approx a minute walk and there are a few junctions to negotiate
