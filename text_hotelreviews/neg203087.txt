standard room is sooooo small not even close to being worth the price and because they are soo small they smell like body odor two adults cannot stay in this room comfortably probably fine for one adult but the smell is still there they need to rip out the carpets regularly in those rooms bathroom is so small it stays wet the entire stay hot tub in spa was cold and the hammam smelled like dirty socks
