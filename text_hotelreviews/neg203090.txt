as your room isn t ready at and you have to wait minutes more in the bar well i don t know how long we had to wait if i checked in at if i go to the reception after minutes for asking if the room was ready and an explanation for the problem the front office lady said easily sorry we had a problem we had to do the evening service and had to change the towels hey hello we haven t check in at the room so there s nothing to be changed and for sure no towels than after the check in the curtains were electric to open and to close a really bad luck because one side was only closing so we mentioned it at the reception and the would handle it when i was on my way to the restaurant but bad luck again the curtains were in the same position as before last but not least the day after in the morning at a waiter knocked at the door for a room service breakfast again bad luck because i haven t order no breakfast at all for a stay of a night without breakfast i could find better places in the city of love
