we paid for nights not including breakfast the breakfast i believe is over priced so if you are going to stay here i would advise to book including breakfast our reservation got cancelled the same day of our arrival it was an error on there end we rebooked within the hour for the same duplex room but ended up paying over more very upsetting they have shower gels and creams to use as expected knowing the price you pay for your stay but our rooms where never topped up with new bottles when our rooms where cleaned quite annoying we would recommend this hotel to others as you will enjoy your stay please book with breakfast the only reason we will not return is the fact that we had to pay extra for no reason of our own we stayed in no may hear a few footsteps in the morning but nothing to moan about
