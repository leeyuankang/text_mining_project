we have the duplex room but the stairs were a bit dangerous the shower is very small and only one hook for bathrobes all the towels i was taking a big shower and washing my hair then water started going out disaster btw the shower was very difficult to switch on off especially when your hands are wet i was panicked when i realized water was flowing out but i couldn t turn it off since my hands were wet i also took a bath in the bath tubs next to the bed but it ended up i couldn t wash away the bubbles on me in the bathtub so i had to walk down to the shower covered with bubbles there were many switches in the room but apart from master switch do not disturb nothing was written complicated for turning on off the lights their staffs were very friendly but not very well trained like there was water at the check in lobby but they didn t propose anything when we arrived for check in there were umbrellas but they didn t say anything when it was raining the bathrobe was on the handle of the stairs for days that they didn t move it for the night service they let the slippers next to the bed but in the bag i know i am picky but many details were missing it s design and trendy but not very comfortable it can be a star but definitely not a star the last thing when we were checking out we had rooms x nights euro but they told me they had pre charged as guarantee euro x plus euro for the room services when we check in so he gave me a refund credit card receipt i used booking com many many times but i never had any other hotel made the calculation this way very confusing
