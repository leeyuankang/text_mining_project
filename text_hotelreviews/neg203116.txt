as of practicality i would say it was only okay the stairs made it a little bit annoying sometimes to move around the room for example when i want to go to the bathroom at night the comforter was really really thick so it was hot at night but when i got out of the bed it was super cold the living room as well as the bathroom were a bit crowded but still comfortable to use also one thing i found a little bit annoying was that i asked the hotel to book me a taxi at my departure to the airport and i specifically confirmed with them that there wouldn t be extra charges for simply the action of booking the taxi however when i got on the taxi the driver told me there was actually charge for calling the taxi so the price i ended up paying wasn t the price the staff told me
