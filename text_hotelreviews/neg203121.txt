we stayed here for our honeymoon and this was the fancy we hotel we chose while in europe it s nice but does not feel like a star hotel we got massages that were nice but not much of a spa despite the decription the space is very small and the changing room is very tiny shared and has just a curtain to close for privacy even though this is where the shower is as well they had a hot tub but it was full when we tried to use it really more than two people is a lot unless it s your friends then maybe four the room was interesting the stairs were intriguing at first but not so fun if you want to use the restroom at night they are small and uncomfortable to step on first thing in the morning making it a bit of a challenge everything was very expensive but the breakfast was good and the staff were friendly
