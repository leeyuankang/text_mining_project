the only thing i didn t like was that all tho the hotel is in a great location it tucked away down a little street and it didn t feel very safe to walk to at night and i had someone actually follow me and tried to take my bag literally from the hotel doors not the hotels fault at all tho and it s the only negative thing i can say as i loved this hotel
