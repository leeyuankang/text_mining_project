the area where the hotel is situated is a bit away from shops and restaurants and not much of a buzz around the location had to travel out of the area to have our evening meal would have liked to have had access to a bath in the room but this was not available even in the upgraded room the shower however was very good the room size was a bit tight and was happy to get the upgrade as not sure if the room i had booked would have been smaller but if it was it would have been very tight for two people
