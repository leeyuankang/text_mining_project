we arrived late and tired because of a taxi strike and were told there is room service so we ordered what we thought would be quick and simple snacks pizza and pasta at about on ordering i was told that it would take about minutes or max which i thought was poor for a star hotel but decided to go ahead anyway one hour later nothing and we re even hungrier and tireder i call again and am told it will be ready in minutes the food eventually arrived minutes later just after hour and minutes after we ordered it as a result we were tired the next day which spoiled the entire trip as we were only there for two days that level of service is simply not good enough in any hotel and is incomprehensible in what is supposed to be a star hotel
