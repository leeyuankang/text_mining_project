we booked at this location mainly because it has a spa unfortunately the sauna was under construction there was no warning on the hotel website or booking com that the sauna was not working it was very disappointing to not be able to enjoy something we were looking forward to the complete spa at the end of a long day of touring in paris we also chose this hotel because of no floor carpeting but the room was still apparently dusty
