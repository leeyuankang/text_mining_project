the room that i booked online was not the one we finally got for me it should be stated on the website that this room is not available and not mislead us like this we wanted to try jacuzzi first they said its out of service and will be available in min nobody was there to provide us an update or more information finally the jacuzzi never worked so we didn t use it again no updated provided and this was not stated on the website one guy from the staff was really reluctant to help us to book online a train ticket and print it really unacceptable for a hotel
