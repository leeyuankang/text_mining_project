the staff were lukewarm they didn t want to be there horribly understaffed i think they only had people working there at one shift one staffer forgot to load a luggage in the shuttle and we had to go back for it nearly missing our flight out this was really unforgivable we were lucky the driver of the taxi shuttle was so nice and accommodating it felt horribly over priced for what you get you are essentially paying for location that s it you can get more from other properties in the city
