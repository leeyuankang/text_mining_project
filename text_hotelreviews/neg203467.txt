extremely expensive for what was offered room had a theme which was nice but was quite old and looked a tad shabby per night and breakfast not included but they don t tell you this till you leave at which point they charge you another per night for city tax and breakfast no tea or coffee making facilities in room room service is lazy as they could not be bothered to replace our dirty wine glasses with clean ones nor to replace the mini complimentary water bottles that we used on first evening there breakfast was quite nice but not worth the money they charged even an expensive restaurant would of been cheaper an extremely disappointing experience
