stayed here for my partners birthday and unfortunately our room was stinking hot which limited sleep we were told the air conditioning was broken and we could move rooms but didn t fancy it at the next night we moved to a lovely room but the air conditioning was really noisy so unfortunately we didn t get much sleep all weekend and felt too tired to do much in the day really disappointing
