the staff were unfriendly and didn t make us feel welcome and it went downhill from our arrivial we waited constantly for someone to answer our room service calls and the food was very underwhelming especially the breakfast which we paid for the misfortune of having when we finally got an answer to our calls there was no acknowledgement of the delay and the staff were abrupt in their tone that said the chambermaids were very polite and the most welcoming of all the hotel staff we stayed during dec and it appears they were understaffed so that might account for the less than experience
