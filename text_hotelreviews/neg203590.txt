i have stayed a few times before in this hotel and know how nice the rooms are however my queen room although heavily discounted but said to have originally been more than per night was somewhat disappointing as it was clearly for a disabled or elderly person equipped with red cord alarms and a seat in the shower and the bed was in an alcove and almost touching the wall i appreciate that i checked in late at about after a long day s work but to be told that that was the last room available was disappointing as my expectations were high
