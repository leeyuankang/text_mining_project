we had planned to stay for nights and left after one night we had two rooms a classic superior this hotel is of a minimalistic design which is very nice except the space is not not used well or functional it is just weird they sell something for using the bath in the room but there was not a bath in the room the picture on booking com shows a bathtub when i asked i was told i didn t pay for a room with one no place to put your luggage they are so worried about design they don t have a coffee maker you can ask for one brought to your room the coffee was awful the walls are paper thin doors slammed shut all evening this was a very noisy hotel which for me is unacceptable construction all around the hotel up and down the streets tried the restaurant which was okay but pricey the concierge was a joke he told me there were no tickets left for the dinner cruise and when i went online myself i was able to purchase them
