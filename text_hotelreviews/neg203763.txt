the room is very nice but there is no storage area to hang clothes except for a hanger in the bathroom the bed was a bit small although very comfy we tried having lunch at the sukka hotel restaurant service was very slow and the food varies from excellent fish to bad chicken they were nice to compensate us with free drinks lychee martini yum
