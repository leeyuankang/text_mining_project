no coffee facilities in your room when not checking in till it s not something you would notice till the morning when paying such a premium is that too much to expect this was booked as a special anniversary treat and no acknowledgement not even a congratulation from receptionist on checking in which you do get from hotels of less than half the price of staying here shame really didn t feel special
