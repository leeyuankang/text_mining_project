no coffee machine in the room for a star hotel you would expect to have at least coffee or tea and an electric kettle if coffee machine in the room is too much not to mention no complimentary coffee in the lobby which these days is a standard in most of the high end us hotels spending fortune for philippe starck s barbells to fit them in the room just to add poshness is a complete nonsense especially when you forget about basic things like coffee or at least some free snacks to nibble instead you get two bottles of mineral water that you normally get anywhere else in or star hotels as a standard late check in starts from which makes things difficult if you arrive in the morning and have to wait until mid afternoon malin goetz soap bar in the bathroom that you cannot wash off your hands as it sticks like nivea interestingly all other toilets in the hotel are equipped with washable liquid soap remember to adjust water to the right temperature before you wash your hands as tap has two separate slippery knobs that are impossible to move with wet hands open plan bathroom and toilet divided by thin curtain so if you are travelling with someone that you don t necessary know well be aware of the smells from the toilet that will most likely be travelling around entire room as toilet ventilation sucks room entrance door just by your bed without any internal corridor so all sounds travel easily both ways in and out especially if your room is by the lifts no wardrobe instead you get few coat hangers in the bathroom separated by the curtain no idea why this hotel gets so many good scores its not always about design but functionality too did not take a chance to try their breakfast to avoid further disappointment paying over for one night excluding breakfast is a laugh unless you are an avid fun of a beetle juice design salvador dali lips sofa philippe starck barbells and nothing else
