the service at breakfast was the worst i have ever experienced in a quality hotel there were sloppy untrained staff it was not busy staff were hanging around chatting to one an other i twice had to send my eggs back as they were not what i had asked for i asked to speak to the manager and was told he was busy eventually i when to the desk where you check in for breakfast and complained and eventually the manager came over he did take the cost of breakfast of the bill but it was the worst experience i have ever had at breakfast i think there needs to be a lot more training
