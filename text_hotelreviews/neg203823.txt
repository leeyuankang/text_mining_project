the hangover from the too excellent bar no smoking on the interior bars is not good it s a shame that their security guards do not understand guests needs and instead insist on behaving like the rude and thuggish ex nightclub bouncers that they seem to be they need firing or customer training in how to talk to people who are paying these prices this place would be much better if the very pretty interior gardens allowed smoking
