we found the design to be a triumph of form over function even down to simple things like the towel rail being out of reach of the shower and the mirror over the sink jutting out over the shower entrance and not being adjustable and there being no tea and coffee making facilities in the room they are provided on request also having to sit on the bed to watch tv because the fixed bench seat was behind a column also the blinds were very irritating so that you couldn t prevent people opposite seeing in to the room without it being totally blacked out because they have removed the facility to adjust the blade angle
