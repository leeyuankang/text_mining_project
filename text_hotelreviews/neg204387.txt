when i first arrived the male attendant was not very friendly i was given a very poor room and the air conditioning was not working and i could not open the blind to let light in the male attendant was not happy that i complained and reluctantly shifted me to a satisfactory room the female attendant the next day was delightful and helpful and reassured me that i could indeed stay in the better room
