the hotel is now very worn and old not in a good way i used to stay here a few years ago and quite liked it but problems with bookings meant i switched to other properties when in london the place feels disorganised my booking had been mixed up and i couldn t get the room i had booked i was given another room which already had other peoples luggage in it staff did not seem to understand why such things are annoying when i eventually spoke to the manager he was very good and promised to rectify things for future trips but there was no practical solution offered i did get the suite i had booked on a my second night but my evening was busy with work and i only got to use it for hours before checking out for the airport all in all very disappointing
