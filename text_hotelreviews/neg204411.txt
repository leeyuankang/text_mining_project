the check in staff were terrible we waited an hour after the check in time and one of our rooms still wasn t ready when we complained about the time it had taken we were told it was our fault for changing from a room we hadn t even booked in the first place no one seemed to have a clue what they were doing then after waiting all that time we were finally told we could get into one of the rooms or could leave our bags behind the desk for later terrible service unfortunately as the hotel was nice
