the facilities are very outdated for a four star hotel i expected it to be in better shape the floors are in serious need of replacement the wifi wasn t very strong but worked okay at first we were in a basement room that has a dead cockroach and were moved upstairs to a much nicer room though again the floors were not great and came off in your socks also the maids did not refill all items each day or take away dirty dishes
