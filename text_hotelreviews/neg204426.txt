a few afternoons were very warm in the room and when there was a breeze it was comfortable however on a couple of days it was quite warm but the a c did not work it appeared that the units were on a timer since they did not function during certain parts of the afternoon the thermostat was locked out but the fan still worked this occurred in each of the rooms in which we stayed we did bring this to the attention of the front desk the first day it occurred but they were not able to adjust the thermostat either it did work later during the following afternoon
