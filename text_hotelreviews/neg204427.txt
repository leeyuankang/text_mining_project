we were given the most dreadful room at the top of the hotel outside the laundry cupboard devoid of any decorative features or comfort it felt like the servants quarters in a town house having stayed here several times before i know there are nicer rooms so we complained and were allocated another room but it was pretty basic the glamour of the entrance hall certainly doesn t run through the hotel the carpet outside our room was totally threadbare the electricity kept cutting out there is a line between shabby chic and downright scruffy and i m afraid that whilst this hotel used to be the former it has become the latter
