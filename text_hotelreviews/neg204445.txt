the first room we were given was very outdated there was a crack in the window and a frame covering a hole in the wall the shower was in a bathtub that was a death trap to get into they had installed a wall along the side to prevent water from getting out and you had to climb in through the slanted back part of the tub surprised nobody has been injured yet the sink also lacked running hot water however when we shared our concerns with the hotel staff they immediately offered to move us to a more updated room
