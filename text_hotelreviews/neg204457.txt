staff were a bit offstandish and even though i chose to pay at the hotel on the saturday the hotel had pre authorised the money since monday when i got to the hotel they pre authorised another in case of damages and mini bar use this money was also held for several more days after we checked out although the staff s defence was that it was made clear before we booked it was not i have never encountered this at a hotel before and disliked it very much also it was not up to the standard you would expect from a star hotel
