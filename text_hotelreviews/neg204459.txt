very basic room with duct tape holding the carpet down asked for breakfast to be sent to in the morning at the front desk the previous evening which the receptionist noted down we waited the next day only to be told we should have put a card on our door we called down for ice to have a drink before we went out and having waited over minutes we called down to cancel as we were leaving hair dryer in the room didn t work so a new one was sent up by the plug on it was broken called down again and the receptionist said their was nothing he could do as that was the only spare i asked if he could get one from another room and he couldn t eventually an electrician was sent up to fix the plug the receptionist seemed as if i was asking a lot of him and as if i were making him go out of his way for something which you would expect to be provided in a hotel room not all the staff were bad and most were helpful and friendly but overall with my experience i would not go back you can get a better room and better service at other hotels for the same price
