the room the carpet is about to come off the cabinet door cannot be opened fully because the bed was blocking it so the drawers could not even be opened the creaky ceilings it was so loud on the very first night of my nights every time the guests in the room above mine walked my ceiling would creak so loudly i reported this to reception when i got back from class the next day they said let me check the guests in that room just checked out to which i replied i m staying for nights you can t assure me that you won t have guests check into that room can you to which he smugly replied we can t transfer you now you can try tomorrow morning if we have an available room no apology and since i was taking short courses my entire stay i didn t have time to unpack and repack to move rooms it was horrible every single night the unaccommodating staff aside from what i said in number i left a denim shopping bag in the room along with some other things i m willing to let go of and on the day i checked out i called them to say i m coming back for it when i get picked up by airport transport they said they ll check but when i went back the concierge just said dismissively that there s nothing i insisted that they have someone check and so he took a binder and said housekeeping reports all items left behind here and there s nothing in your room i can understand if they just don t keep things left behind but they could say it politely like they actually care because i paid gbp per night for nights the pathetic service they have old carpet on the narrow corridors leading to the rooms it s so difficult to pull luggage on it and when i was led to my room i wasn t even offered help with my pieces of luggage which i was clearly having difficulty with despite them being rimowa with wheels the lack of linens
