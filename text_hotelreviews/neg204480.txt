i don t know if room service for food was not available at the time i arrived as the menu actually looked really good with some lovely dishes i was given a menu from a local take out place it was pizza and pasta and the usual high carbs what i term as terrible food i m into healthy eating and gluten free if possible so i was struggling to get something reasonably healthy
