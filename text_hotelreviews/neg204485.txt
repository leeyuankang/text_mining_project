there was a problem with the booking we had paid for a breakfast on booking com but the people at the hotel refused to honour it despite being shown the email they tried to make us pay for it and held us up by insisting on discussion it really this was between the hotel and the booking company if they don t want to use a booking company they shouldn t do it or they should fulfill obligations without argument it certainly was not our problem
