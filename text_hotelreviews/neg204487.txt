on arrival we were allocated a top floor apartment whilst the apartment was nice there had been a bed made up in the lounge area that we didn t require we asked if we could put the bed away and we re told that it was broken the bed took up all of the lounge defeating the object of staying in an apartment keeping the lounge and bedrooms separate secondly and most importantly the locks on the windows of the bedrooms were broken we were floors up and there was a sheer drop to the ground the windows opened up fully and with ease and as we have small children we asked if the locks could be fixed or if we could move to another apartment we were told the locks couldn t be fixed that day and they had no more apartments left so we were moved to what they described as a family suite the suite was in fact a small room on the floor with beds in it it was old dated beyond hot and extremely noisy the bathroom was disgusting this is apparently a hotel we explained that we were not happy and that we had paid for an apartment and that s what we wanted the manager assured us he would do his best to sort out an alternative apartment the following day but we would have to stay in the family suite the first night we were told we would have to pack all our belongings up for a third time and that we would be moved the next day we went off in to london to spend the half term with our children seeing the sights we were contacted by staff at the hotel no less than times throughout our day asking us various questions and completely ruining our day out the manager also insisted we return to the hotel at to have a meeting all while we were simply trying to enjoy our time away with our children on return to the hotel later that evening my husband was summoned to another meeting lasting over minutes by the manager
