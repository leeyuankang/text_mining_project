full english breakfast was a tad expensive at each and fairly average to be honest if it had been better i may have paid for the second day but in the end found a better caf around the corner which was better value and better taste the hotel is a little bit shabby in places which a little more tlc or maybe a bit of touch up painting would improve for a small cost however this was fine given the cost of our stay so i have not marked the hotel down for this as overall i would definitely stay there again
