i booked the hotel to include a full english breakfast to be told a couple of days before that it was actually a mistake and they could only offer a continental breakfast on arrival at the hotel when i made an order for room service they told us that they had no food so we had to order from there partner takeaway service which was a kebab shop we ordered through the hotel quarter pounder cheeseburger and paid they delivered just a portion of chips that we did not order and no burger spoke to the hotel and the kebab shop and was refused my money back the hotel did nothing to follow this up so i was without the correct food i ordered and down by from the room service menu there was a cream tea which was a tea and a fruit scone the man said they should have this minutes later he come up to the room with just a cup of earl grey tea an apple and an orange to compensate for the scone and charged me there was already tea in the room so i refused to pay this as firstly i asked for english breakfast tea and not early grey secondly there was already tea in the room i just wanted to order the cream tea as it came with a scone but they was unable to provide this in the end i disputed this charge for the wrong tea and they removed this from the bill
