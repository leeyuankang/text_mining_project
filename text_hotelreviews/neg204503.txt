the hotel itself is incredibly outdated and could do with a serious update the carpets appeared filthy i felt i had to wear shoes in my room the throw on my bed was tired and had some sort of coffee ring stain the fitness centre was extremely limited and the wifi was exceptionally poor slow and kept dropping out the bed was exceptionally uncomfortable i like a firm mattress but this was like lying on a board and the pillows were flat lumpy not impressed and would not consider staying here again
