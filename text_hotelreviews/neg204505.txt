the staff would put a letter under the door daily telling you that although you request no room cleaning after days they require to be cleaned ok so on that day we left and came back after to hours of being gone and our room door was ajar a slight crack and not pulled shut luckily for us nothing going was taken but definitely made the staff aware that this was unacceptable
