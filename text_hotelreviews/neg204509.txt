the quality of the rooms is quite bad overall everything in the hotel is tiny bathrooms are small and cheaply built the continental breakfast was not really eatable overcooked eggs and cheese which is wet from fat due to planned engineering works at the nearby underground station the hotel is not that easy to reach and the worst the hotel is that bad built that i woke up every time sbd used a bathroom next to above or under my room
