we arrived back at the hotel on day of our trip to find a live cockroach on the floor we were given a different room but we never expected to see a cockroach in our room although the hotel looked relatively clean and tidy it obviously wasn t we were not offered any compensation for this and hardly an apology it felt like this happens more often than not would definitely never recommend or return
