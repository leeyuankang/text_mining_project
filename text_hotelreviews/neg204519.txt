we booked and executive double bedroom and received a shoe box the room was tiny you had to walk like a crab between the bed and wardrobe to get to the other side of the room the carpet was coming up in places and it was horrifically stained there was a massive brown stain in one corner looked like it might have been false tan or something i have stayed in travelodges far nicer and cleaner than this place the hotel itself was grotty appreciate it is an old hotel but if you re boasting stars and charging that amount per room you would expect it to be a bit up to date or at least clean i booked this for myself my parter and another room for my parents for a night out in london to say we were all highly disappointed is an understatement i complained at the desk about the state of the room and was just stared at blankly i was then told that if i come back at the following morning they might be able to offer me complimentary breakfast poor customer service as if i m going to set my alarm to get up and go seeking a free breakfast something should have been offered on the spot as is common practice in customer service really really disappointing altogether
