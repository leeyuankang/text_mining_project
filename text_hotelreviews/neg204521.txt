terrible staff last day there was an extremely rude receptionist they lost our luggage that was left in storage after that they have realized that it was locked somewhere and they could not find the key it took them more than an hour and only after my call to the police they finally opened the door and returned me the bags but i missed the last train and was almost late to the airport very very stressful
