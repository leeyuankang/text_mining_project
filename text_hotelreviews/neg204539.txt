i m amazed that this place is considered star hotel i would hate to see a or star either the aa reviewer is completely blind or the hotel has painted an extra couple of stars on themselves grumpy staff badly threadbare carpets tired decor non functional aircon and a broken lift i didn t want to risk eating in the restaurant judging by the rest of the hotel and the fact that the enticer menu in the lift had serious spelling errors i arrived in my cupboard sorry room which hadn t been hoovered to find that the tiny room was baking on discovery that the aircon was broken i called reception to be told that all air con in the hotel has been disabled for winter i ended up having to stick a fan in an open window to try to cool down the room fortunately there was not much room to cool lets just say that after a shower it was not possible to stand at the end of the bed to to use the towel as there wasn t enough room all in all a very unpleasant and overpriced place to stay needless to say i shall not be returning here
