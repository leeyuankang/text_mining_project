the staff was not particularly friendly my room had a interior garden door which wasn t closing it s also so loud i could hear the woman in the room next door talking on the phone it was so loud it sounded like she was in the same room as me also there was some constant noise in my room might have been the central heating system or something like that but thankfully i had earplugs
