staff were rude and unhelpful we were placed in a basement room that smelt damp and had peeling plaster our view was of some grates that cover the storage heaters the bathroom was very cramped with the shower tray having a crack running through it also the cradle for the shower head was not fitted correctly so it fell off each time you attempted to use it as a responsible guest i had reported these issues so the following morning we were visited by maintenance and cleaning staff from this hotel saw fit to ruin my stay with this behaviour as i had traveled to london for a relaxing time and this was spoilt by their insistence to fixing these issues they could have simply waited until i d checked out to do this if you want to stay in a hotel that completely inconsiderate of it s guest stay at the commodore hotel
