the rooms were smaller than expected barely fitting for two people the bathrooms even smaller when we arrived the room looked like it hasn t been cleaned for days the carpet was stained room service barely did any vacuuming they only made the bed and that is all definitely not value for money please spend your money elsewhere with the rates we got which was quite expensive we did not even get breakfast
