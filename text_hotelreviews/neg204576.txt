the price went from to because i changed the date by one week when i arrived the price was plus breakfast i was with my wife so didnt want to start a fuss as it was our anniversary the bedroom was cramped the bed was like sleeping on a door the dinning room was far to small for the amount of people staying it was chaotic to be honest i am a seasoned traveller ive only ever stayed in a hotel this poor on one other occasion it felt like a second rate guest house
