we had a good sized room and bathroom but the hotel does seem a little out dated and dirty the hotel is in need of a little restoration or deep cleaning we had mould growing inside the shower and my girlfriend was complaining about the hairdryer as it was from the if you are thinking of staying bring your own hairdryer probably shouldn t be rated as a four star hotel
