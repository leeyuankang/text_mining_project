given wrong room despite booking and arriving on time double instead of suite and offered no apology or reduction in price other than two complimentary continental breakfasts which had a poor selection room was incredibly noisey and nowhere near what you d expect for a star hotel tiny lift and worn carpets tatty furniture overpriced plug sockets minimal and inconvenient to get to also our luggage was stored unacceptably for hours in main reception area by a communal doorway very disappointing
