everything else was beyond awful the fridge inside didn t work the shower flooded the water temperature fluctuated from scalding to freezing and would even switch off entirely the sink tap spits water at you as the plumbing is hopeless the curtains in the room are hung on with seriously sharp hooks bent to all proportions and fall off occasionally the tv regularly turned on by itself during the night due to a timer that couldn t be changed and the air conditioner blows out dust as the bottom section is not closed off plus the top floor cannot be accessed by the lift and the lift itself can only fit person with luggage at a time the staff did not appear surprised when we raised concerns about the fridge not working i suspect they ve heard it all before a real shame this hotel could be so much more
