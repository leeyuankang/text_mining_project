the hotel was scruffy and run down dead plants on the doorstep and pop music playing in the lobby in an edwardian style hotel was really tacky i was in a room facing the inner courtyard with a view of air con pipes and some plastic plants in pots the courtyard was netted against pigeons the net was full of litter the room was dusty the bathroom door handle broken the shower curtain mouldy and the hairdryer cut out every seconds due to overheating staff and guests sitting smoking on the front steps created a really poor impression on arrival the lounge was closed off with plastic hazard tape it was somewhere to lay my head for the night the best i can say is that the sheets were clean
