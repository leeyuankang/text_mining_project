the first night i was put in a room located at the floor no elevator on this floor got to stop on the and climb some stairs which was next to the elevators generator or something that was extremely noisy and totally unacceptable i called the reception who offered me straight away an option to change room but as it was at night i preferred to move to another room in the morning the next day i moved to a bed room floor which was very spacious and great however i consider bad choice to put me next to the noise in the first place as they were aware of the problem at least they were very helpful and wanted to make up immediately in addition the hotel is relatively old and requires some maintenance on the other hand the great location minutes from lancaster gate station and the helpful staff especially the greek receptionist will make me to visit again this hotel
