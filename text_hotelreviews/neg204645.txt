i had to move rooms because the water didn t drain out of my shower so my bathroom flooded then my shower in the second room went from scolding hot to freezing cold and was never a suitable temperature to shower under the hotel called me back after i told them about this problem and said they would look at the issue but they followed up with an email saying that after investigation they found nothing was wrong with my second room shower the email implied i had made it up they offered an abysmal discount and made me feel like i was the one that had done something wrong whilst checking in several other customers were complaining about various things and were met with blank helpless expressions at reception not nearly enough man power either
