the conditions of the rooms i asked to be moved because the first room smelt stale smokey and damp the staff were helpful and offered me a twin room not ideal but did smell of fresh paint the rest of the room was tired the carpet was threadbare there was paint all over the carpet and generally the room was the type you would get in a star hotel
