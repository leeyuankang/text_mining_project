after being shown to our room we discovered the bed was broken we complained and told there is only one more room in the place in the basement this wasn t great but we didn t have a choice so accepted it then discovered that half the sockets on the room didn t work this if we r honest was more annoying than a problem then after a few drinks and a meal in london we get back to the hotel into bed only to find out that the underground runs under our room that will be us awake till then at the front desk phones us to say that s our wake up call which is fine except we didn t ask for a bloody wake up call no apology no nothing not one manager spoke to us about our disappointing stay after we complained numerous times would stay again
