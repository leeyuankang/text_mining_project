the condition of the room in the hotel and apartment we had were not great floors had stains and the hotel room smelt a little musty wouldn t say it was for hotel rooms sofa bed in the apartment was extremely creaky and could not be folded so was a bit out of place in the lounge dining area and in the room for there was barely a sofa bed just a thin small sofa with sheets on top if there are larger guests it would not be appropriate
