the staff is kind and smiling unfortunately behind this kindness there s no real willing to provide proper service on the second day of our staying in the hotel hot water finished in our room we had to move to another room the only available room was really downgraded although the at the reception we were told that it was a very good one it s enough to say that it was a smoked room it was also cold and the air conditioner was broken there was no personal lights near the beds and so on only when i really insisted they finally found one better room
