it s advertised as a hotel however i have stayed in hostels with better quality than this hotel i would not recommend to anyone as i had to complain twice to get my room changed as it was not what i payed for the shower as you can see in the pic i have posted the door is the opening forward so if you wanted to close to have a shower you would have to be a skinny minny to do it so otherwise you wouldn t be able to close the door
