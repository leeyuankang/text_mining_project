i was given a room where i had to climb about flights of stairs there was no lift the bathroom was tiny and in the shower it was not possible to bend down or move your arms at all because of the size of the shower there were two windows on the ceiling where light came down but there were no blinds to control the light it was difficult to rest and get decent sleep i had paid for the room on line but at the time of check in i was told that it was not paid and i had to pay around which was double the amount that i had already paid i asked the guy at the reception to check again i was then told that it was a mistake and the bill was someone else s however i was not offered any apology for this error
