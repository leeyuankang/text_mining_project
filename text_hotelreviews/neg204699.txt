the standard of the room was below average considering the price we paid there was lots of little things about the room that brought down the overall quality for example there were holes in the walls partially covered by paintings the tv reception was often poor and would drop out there was a big crack in the floor in the corner by the shower where water would gather after dripping down the side of the shower wall as a result you could tell there was water damage to the floor underneath as it was quite warped you could tell there would be issues in future with water leaking down the walls into the floors below causing mould and structural issues also there was no lift in the building at all which was a pain and something i didn t realise before booking here we were lucky to be on the second floor but could imagine it would have been difficult for those who ended up with a room on one of the floors above ours
