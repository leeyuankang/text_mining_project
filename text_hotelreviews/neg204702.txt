room was very basic which is partially understandable as its in london but cleanliness waa questionable at one point upon entering the room we saw a beetle cockroach run actoss the floor the biggest problem however was the squeaky floorboards and bed we were woken up multiple points during the night because of this and were both restless the following day as a result will not be staying here again
