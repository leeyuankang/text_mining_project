we friends had booked a bedroom apartment which was down in the basement no info on the website of that with a bunker feeling and a clear smell of mould we were offered a bedroom apartment with a sofabed in replacement and the feeling from the concierge was that if we did not accept it we would not have anywhere to stay or had to go back in to the basement the apartment was poorly equipped so we did not even think about using the kitchen it was really cold in the apartment so when inside we sat in the bed with our blankets on the breakfast we paid a lot extra for was not worth the penny for the same sum you get a full english breakfast at any cafe in the neighbourhood
