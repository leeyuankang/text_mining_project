the rooms were dirty especially the carpets and sink the electrical box was exposed above the door way the tv cabinet doors were broken the sofa bed had big gaps between the end of the frame and maytress at both ends this is very dangerous for children becoming trapped the breakfast was none existent and extremely expensive we were given upgrades so i don t know what the otber rooms were like the poster bed was comfy tey didn t replenish the taea or coffee or put clean cups in the room after the first night the hotel was just lacking in all areas for the price and being in london i expected much more i recommend it if you can get a cheap deal we paid for our rooms for nights i wouldn t say it was value for money you are better off staying in a travel lodge or premier inn the location is good for winter wonderland we were disapointed
