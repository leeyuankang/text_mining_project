the hotel room was small and not very well appointed the hotel was gloomy and in need of a face lift there were health and safety issues in that the stair carpet on the th floor was fraying and loose trip hazards i have photographs the staff plainly have not had any training in customer relations or of working in a service industry once my daughter and i had booked in no member of staff spoke to us at all not even to say good morning or have you had a pleasant day it was as if we had become invisible having not taken any heed of us as we left and returned to the hotel i cannot imagine what a problem there would have been had there been a fire who is in the building who is not in the building the staff would not have had a clue i used to be a management surveyor and therefore know a lot about safety issues and the power that the health and safety executive possesses neither of the two men at reception on the day we left made a move to help me with my case down the steps i am years old female i suspect they were still reeling after i gave them my views on the hotel it was unfortunate for this hotel that the hotel we had staying the night before was a premier inn which was light bright slick and all the staff were smiling helpful and looked as if they gave a damn what our stay was like and happily their floors did not creak every time we made a move it was more central and also was marginally cheaper the only cheery person i encountered at the commodore was vincy the person who carried our cases to the room for us
