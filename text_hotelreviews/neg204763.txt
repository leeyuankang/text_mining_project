really bad condition on the inside of the hotel and we were sent to the basement to stay which were very dissapointing that we would not settle for so we told the staff who said all were booked and then the phone rang and he offered a room availeble for that costumer and also moved us up on the floor instead the carpets are finished and in the room it could not be more stained and the cover on the chair looked like a chair in a garage who fix cars i could not touch the floor with my bare feet and der were no slippers the towels smelled like they were hang to dry nextside the kitchen it is way to expensive with that standard we will never come back
