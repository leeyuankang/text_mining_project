unfortunately a very bland experience a hotel that seems to rely solely on location to get customers not making any kind of lasting impression and therefore no incentive for me to go back on arrival i was given an upgrade for some reason and therefore given a double room w twin beds what use i as a single traveler have of a room w two beds is a mystery to me
