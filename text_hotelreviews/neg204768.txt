i was upgraded i did not ask for the upgrade to appartment accommodation a short walk from the hotel the porter who accompanied me was new and we ended up climbing numours stairs in error when i final got to my room i did not like the alone feeling also the hotel had no restaurant for dinner and they did not do room service to the appartments so i walked back to the hotel where they were able to give me a nice room in the hotel it would have saved an unpleasant experience if they had done this first
