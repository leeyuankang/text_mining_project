we were told the appartment i had booked was not available after i had already booked it and paid for it the month before then we got given a suite which wasn t very clean and had a metal staircase to balcony bed not good when you have young children so changed rooms to another room which was much better but not very big when you have two young children they did offer return which isn t much considering i was paying for a large apartment anyway i also asked for an iron which when it turned up at the room the electrical cable was exposed in places and badly twisted not safe at all and extremely dangerous around kids didn t seem to be concerned when i returned it to reception and explained the standard requirement for electrical cable
