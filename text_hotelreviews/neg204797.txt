we couldn t get the room we booked which was a post bed suite with a balcony so the receptionist said there were maintenance issues so for the night we were put in a normal hotel room and weren t refunded any money the second night we were put into the type of room we wanted but minus the balcony which we specifically booked so we went down to breakfast in the morning but were mins late our fault the waitress said she can give us some croissants and coffee and we can go back to our room which made us feel like we ve been bad and should be punished so we complained and this time she said the customer extended their stay which is different from what she said before after all that we still had to pay full price for the room we didn t get
