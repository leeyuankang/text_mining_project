booked as a special christmas present for my wife musical and nice hotel although room was lovely we were disappointed to find it was a basement room disappointment further compounded on return from show by food and cooking smells in room from nearby kitchen breakfast average eggs benedict on somewhat hard muffin overall ok but not the special hotel we had expected for the price
