disguising cleanliness the carpets are so dirty i would never think of lying or sitting on the floor the bed spread on my bed was so full of dust that my eyes became itchy when lifting it to pull it up or off it took requests to have it changed to a clean one the internet works spasmodically i was moved times in my first day as the first room was so small you could not walk around the bed and it had no tv as advertised the second room had no internet reception the third room had two broken bedside lights which were never repaired but i had given up changing rooms lying in bed at night you can hear all the movement from the rooms next to you and above and even hear them talking my bed only got made properly twice in my days the other days a half baked attempt was made to pull the blanket up without even straightening the sheets the only electrical plug is under the tiny desk so i had to boil the kettle under the desk and charge my phone plug in my computer in the same place my laundry was lost until found included in another room s laundry normally when travelling your hotel room can be a sanctuary from a busy day i dreaded coming back to the hotel every evening and on the weekends made sure that i stayed out all day booking com refused to let me cancel as i had prepaid which given the state of the hotel is a very poor reflection on bookings com as well
