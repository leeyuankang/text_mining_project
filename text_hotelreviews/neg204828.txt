there are squeaking sounds from the floor when you step on it in the room and you can her it from the other rooms and it s very disturbing the room i paid for was an executive one but i found out it was very small and it was not as shown on the booking web site the hall was small an narrow the hotel had only one lift and it was small and narrow as well the furniture was old and not in a classic way it is a motel not a hotel i can t believe someone gave it a star hotel i don t recommend this hotel to my enemies
