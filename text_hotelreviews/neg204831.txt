we had stayed in this hotel before and thought it was good returned to find we were given a room that smelled and had dampness all over the wall and asked to change rooms we were given a new room which wasn t much better walls were dirty the curtains were falling down and there was dust all over the chair which was not cleaned for our stay awful experience we will never stay there again
