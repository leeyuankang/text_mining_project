hostility of staff all foreign so not as understandable when booked requested early check in and the receptionist refused to even check if the room was ready until after even though requested on booking online had issue with breakfast as booked online and paid an extra extortion for what it was only to realise in hotel it was only actually each then we went for breakfast they told us we couldn t have any as not paid when i had booked online and had an email proving it this was very embarrassing and even after showing the staffy email and them timing reception i still had to go up to reception myself to sort it out and leave my partner very embarrassed waiting at the breakfast room
