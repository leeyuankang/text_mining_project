how noisy the hotel was the carpets must have needed replacing about years ago they are so worn that it is almost a health hazard the place is also very dirty rooms and halls bathrooms are a bit cleaner although my shower would not drain properly so i had to limit my shower to minutes in order to avoid overfill flooding this was my stay and my last stay
