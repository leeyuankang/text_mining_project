the staff here are indifferent and the hotel didn t respond to communication in the lead up to my stay i arrived hours prior to check in time and had emailed twice in the week leading up to staying to ask for an early check in even offering to pay for it after a hour journey from australia i didn t receive a response and my room was not ready until hours after their advertised check in time i was offered a toilet off reception to use to change and told they would store my bags the toilet floor was covered in urine it was a disgusting and disappointing start to my trip that coloured my view of the hotel
