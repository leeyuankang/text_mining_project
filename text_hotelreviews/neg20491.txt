we reserved two rooms one of which is a deluxe double room with a bathtub which is recorded on the booking com s confirmation document however there was no bathtub in the room and the staff at the front desk told that it was a pity that booking com showed incorrect information on web and there was not such room available for us after a discussion they offered a higher rate room with a bathtub we enjoyed london trip very much but did not enjoy the discussion we stayed at the room paying extra charge but for us it was not a pleasant experience and the explanation of the staff at the front desk was not trustworthy nor reliable
