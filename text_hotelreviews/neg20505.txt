the breakfast was a bit of a disappointment the first morning the process was not explained to us very well the second morning the young waitress explained all the options to us although i did have to wait minutes and ask twice for the cereal bowl to be filled before i could have some it seemed a bit hit and miss on the pastries as there was not a lot of selection on either morning we normally stay in either the waldorf or savoy both star and their breakfast is the same sort of cost but with a lot more choice of items to choose from
