air con in room was set for heat only this could not be changed for individual rooms so when the ambient temperature in the room was high even with the air con off the only way to cool the room was open the windows which made it quite noisy although the room had a mini bar there were no facilities in the room to make a hot drink and none in the hotel that were available to use during the day not very good for a star rated hotel
