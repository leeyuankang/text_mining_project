warning the pictures can be deceiving not all of the rooms look as fabulous as depicted on the website when we arrived we were directed to a room that was downright gross stains on the carpet and chairs run down water stains on the walls and ceiling and smelly when we complained we were directed to another room that looked like it was recently remodeled it was better than the first room and overall it was ok but the experience left a bad taste in my mouth i did not expect this type of experience for the amount of money that we paid they have a key policy that was strange to me you had to turn in your key each time you left the hotel and had to pick it up when you came back this made me feel uneasy as not every desk clerk asked me our name when i asked for our room number key this means anyone could just walk in and get a room key
