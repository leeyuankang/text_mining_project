as i was with a person with reduced mobility the negative points concern accessibility the bathtube is very high difficult for a disabled person to enter and leave by itself the breakfast was in the basement not accessible with the elevator the steps just outside the elevators that give access to the rooms required some care the room is a little bit dark wifi unstable access is hard few buses far from metro stations
