the parking is incredibly expensive euros for the night the cleaning ladies transformed my mornings into a nightmare they bang the doors of the neighboring rooms all the time and worse they chat all the time among themselves but dont imagine they just talk silently they yell they laugh and they will make your morning rest impossible if you are sleeping later than am the room service is charged euros on top of the price of what you are having and room service is all you have after because the bar wont serve any kind of snacks
