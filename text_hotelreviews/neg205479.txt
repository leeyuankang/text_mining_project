i didn t like the fact that although we were paying a lot for the price of the room we couldn t get an adapter to use for free we had to buy it from the mini bar for which is unexpected for a stars luxurious hotel as i have stayed in many hotels before also all the movies provided on tv required payment however this is kind of usual in all hotels spa facilities were priced the same to hotel guests and outsiders usually guests who stay at the hotel get more offers
