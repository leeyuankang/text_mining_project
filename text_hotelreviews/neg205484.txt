when a hotel is this expensive and also not exactly in a prime location to justify the extra expense it is at least minutes walk from the champs lys es then my expectations are much higher and unforunately there were two key areas that i felt were lacking the breakfast it is either for a continental breakfast or for full as always i opted for the continental however the selection and quality was very poor for this price point utensils and plates hard to find and the facilities such as the cereal dispenser and toaster not well maintained and not working properly overall very disappointing especially as breakfast is what you do before checking out so is the last main memory i would recommend any guest if they have the time to skip breakfast here and search out a cafe or bakery somewhere nearby wish i done that my room was a little cold and this remained despite turning the heating on full also i could not find the hairdryer which only increased this problem also the wifi seemed to intermittantly drop out and i had to reconnect my devices numerous times during the stay not huge issues but again for the price you expect more
