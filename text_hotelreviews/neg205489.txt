there was nothing superior about our superior room and expected a lot more for our money i feel if you are after a deal at this hotel they put you way out the back in the star area nothing star about our room whatsoever when we called in advance about the spa we were told it was just for access per person so we decided not to take our swim suits but when we arrived we were told it was free but we had no swim suits door staff and the staff roaming around reception not very friendly but the lady who checked us in was very nice overall i wish we booked elsewhere for the one night we stayed in paris it s not the worst place i have stayed in paris but have stayed in many better welcoming cheaper hotels in this city
