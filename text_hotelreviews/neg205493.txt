this is never a star hotel in any sense and more akin to a medium star the hotel is old and shabby and dirty shower was pathetic and the furniture damaged and broken and showing signs of repair other than the location which is good and close to the arc de triomphe and the champs elysee i could not recommend it to any traveller
