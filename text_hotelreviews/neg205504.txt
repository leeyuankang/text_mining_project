the staff were not helpfull couldn t go in the gardens had randomly closed it as they pleased and never turned the lights on so was always dull out but that was not what i read when i booked the hotel water and coffe were over priced the only clean part of the hotel was the lobby i hated my experience in this hotel would never go back even the extractor fans in the bathrooms did not work
