booked executive floor especially for the lounge told closed and gave us euro to use in overpriced restaurants an bar s the upgrade to a executive king is not value for money rooms are just slightly biggear but not worth the extra euro per night would suggest ask to check the room prior as some are tired we would not stay here again
