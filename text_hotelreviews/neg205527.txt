the gym was not just for hotel guests my wife and i found out they have memberships for anyone the equipment was always in use by people not staying at the hotel the location also was poor it was over a minute walk to get to any shop or restaurant worthwhile it was also far from tourist attractions they also would not let us get delivery to the room so we would have to pay for the food then pay for delivery to the hotel and then tip the concierge to bring it up our original room was smoking even though we specified upon booking we wanted a non smoking room
