some general confusion around payment i was told accommodation had to be prepaid but i wasn t charged in advance then the reception staff got a bit shirty with me when i questioned an additional preauthorisation on my card attempted without explanation which i did not enjoy the spa is tiny it s just a large jacuzzi and a couple of small sauna rooms also the room aircon was pretty loud so we settled for an open window and street noise
