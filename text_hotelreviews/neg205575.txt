my son is an accomplished pianist and asked if he could play the grand piano one evening the lady on the reception said he could when he tried to play the next day he was told by the concierge that he should stop and he was not allowed to play the evening before we had see other children playing using the end of an umbrella on the keyboard but they were not told to stop
