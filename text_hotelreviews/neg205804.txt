we travelled with friends and had two rooms side by side quite a difference in the room sizes especially the bathrooms our bathroom although beautiful was tiny you could not open the shower door great shower though unless you wedged yourself into the corner by the toilet fine for a couple of nights but would have been a problem for a longer stay as no space to put anything
