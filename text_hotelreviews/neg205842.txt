the receptionist who helped us checked in was the most unfriendly receptionist we ve ever seen and did not make us feel welcomed she was not smile at all and did not tell me whether she s finish using my passport or not and just left it at the side the most weird thing was when i had eye contact with her she was starring at me right into my eyes expressionless i smiled at her and she was just keep starring at me like i m a alien or something however the receptionist who helped us checked out was very nice and friendly
