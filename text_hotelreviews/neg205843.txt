the fire alarm went off three times due to system issues during our stay all in the middle of the nights the hotel did not handle it well after the alarms went off there were no effort to let people know that they were false alarms i called the front desk but the no one answered the phone i had to get downstairs to ask the staff for information the hotel does not seem to understand the customers are scared when they hear the fire alarms the no action of the hotel staff is extremely disappointing for this reason alone i will never stay here again
