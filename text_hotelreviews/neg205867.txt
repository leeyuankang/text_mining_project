rooms were very tiny we took a deluxe double studio and a deluxe one bedroom suite they were both very small for the price no room service in the hotel breakfast as we were told only consists of tea coffee and croissants for pounds a day hotel is not bad in general but it s we felt that it was a bit overpriced for the size of the rooms and services available in the hotel overall it was an ok stay
