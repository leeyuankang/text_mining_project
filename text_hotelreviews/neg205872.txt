the temperature control in the room was not good it was either too hot with the heating on or too cold in the bathroom if you turned it off made the stay very uncomfortable also room was tiny and did not make good use of space no provision in the shower to place your toiletries had to put them on the floor also the towel rack was so high i needed to climb on the toilet seat to grab a towel just needs a bit more care and attention
