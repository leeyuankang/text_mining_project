it is not a hotel but more like a b b no bar no room service no food served no mini bar even if there is a kitchenette it would have been nice to have a mini bar part of it and some food available just in case no proper breakfeast served either so in terms of value for money it is fair water was not hot enough in the shower temperature limited and heating was a bit fussy additionally having a bathroom equipped with the disabled equipment makes it a little less charming and plastic tiles on the floor and walls too ok that is looking into details as in general the rooms are really comfortable and hotel very close to paddington station which is so easy to get to and from heathrow
