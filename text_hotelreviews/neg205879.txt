there was no door separating the bedroom to the living area with a baby that s a complete bummer tge cleaning times were wacky and not very client friendly abd even when raised this point they still didn t do it sooner we had also to pay for a baby coat and not cheap they can be more transparent about this hidden cost and follow other hotels that do not charge anything small things toiletries were fully changed renewed only at our request room vacuuming could have been better
