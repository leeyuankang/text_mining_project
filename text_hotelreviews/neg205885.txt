room was extremely small the road outside of the hotel was perpetually lined with honking traffic it was so hard for the uber driver to stop and pick passengers up the hotel also does not serve breakfast lastly the hotel does not even have the facilities to store our luggage for nights while we sightsee in paris even though we have booked for the subsequent nights in the deluxe suite in the end the options they gave was ask my pregnant wife to lug the luggage to the train station to store it there find another hotel i cancelled the remaining nights and found a more reputable one that stored our luggage
