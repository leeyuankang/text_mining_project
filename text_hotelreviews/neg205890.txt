getting in and out of the bathroom was a struggle small doors were hitting i asked to extend my stay by a day or two if available days before checkout the gentleman at night suggested i contact the staff tomorrow i thought it strange since he was at the desk already i asked the young lady at the desk the following day she said there were no availabilities that is all i am accustomed to hotel staff offering other options but she came off as inexperienced and quite rude i think unintentional on her part i expected they were filling up but was fine with booking a different type of room or paying extra had it been offered i think she meant there were no similar rooms available at my discounted rate rather than there were absolutely no rooms available was not keen on that lack of courtesy i stayed somewhere else the following day after checkout
