my only complaint would be the positioning of a bright green light in the passageway ceiling possibly part of the alarm or smoke detector system which for us was quite intrusive not a complaint but if we were staying for a longer period i would go for an upgraded room with more space although there was a small bar in the foyer it wasn t attended so i guess they don t serve drinks there but not a problem in central london
