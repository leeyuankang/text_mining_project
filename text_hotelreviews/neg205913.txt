reception at this hotel checked me in to the hotel room n the afternoon at pm they checked in further quests into the same room total strangers walked in to my guest room when i was undressed very poor attitude of management and terrible security and in my case total disregard to my privacy total strangers being given access by reception to my room late at night is reckless and dangerous
