wifi is a little weak rooms on the first floor are a bit noisy you can hear the rooms above and some street noise room was near the lift so i would advise a room farther away the bed was singles pushed together and even though they placed a thick bedding on top to hold them together you could still feel the crack in the middle classic room is a tad small
