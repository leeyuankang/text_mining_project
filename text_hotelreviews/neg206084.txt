rue de malte is a quieter side road and there were discarded needles and homeless men close outside i did feel vulnerable at night when walking back from the metro my fault as i should have got a taxi to the door however this is paris and the hotel is so well positioned to walk and explore that such issues which are issues in any major city are ones that are no fault of the hotel
