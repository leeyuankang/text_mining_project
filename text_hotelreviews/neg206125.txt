at night there was no one manning the front desk and the electric door of the hotel was open to anyone to walk in it should only open when you swipe a hotel key for example for added security floor has stairs to get to it as elevator only goes to had to carry my bag up stairs with slipper discs and wasn t told ahead of time at night as a woman alone i felt there could be additional security at the hotel doors and reception to restrict who can come in as no one around to ask for help in case it is needed a tight squeeze to get into the shower if you are big or pregnant as a small framed person i had to put my back against the tiles to get in as it only swings inwards due to tight space
