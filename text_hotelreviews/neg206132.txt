the room was tiny even by paris standards the bathroom was in a cupboard no room at all the shower was minuscule decor was extremely tired and dirty in places lots of mold in the bathroom all english speaking tv was broken and the reception would not apologise or resolve wifi was very very slow sound proofing in the hotel was non existent in general a tiny property in need of a refurbishment really not up to mercure standards
