room is indeed small bathroom included the neighborhood can look sketchy but you only take a minute to walk to the hotel from the metro we didn t have any problems whatsoever this hotel has of the smallest elevators we ever used only persons fit barely with suitcases as a result it s very busy in the morning the view for which we payed extra means we have to stick our heads out the window to see the sacr coeur so not really worth it pay attention when booking the price doesn t include the tax of plus euros per person per night
