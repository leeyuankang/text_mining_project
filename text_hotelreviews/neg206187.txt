first of all the name is misleading this hotel has nothing to do with a best western second i have no clue if the stars they say they have are real it would be incredible the neighborhood is not nice i was there because i needed to be in that neighborhood the rooms are very small the breakfast is ok and the rest of the facilities are just average
