overall very satisfied with our stay however would have preferred a walk in shower instead of over bath tub not ideal for older person to climb in and out unfortunately there wasn t air conditioning a definite must in hot summer conditions so the room became too warm and uncomfortable an electric fan was available this helped a little but obviously couldn t be used through night because of the noise
