the only negative thing i can say about the hotel is that our room had the window completely frosted over we thought this might be for privacy but it wasn t particularly overlooked and this can be dealt with by using a net curtain of some sort it made the room feel very claustrophobic especially as the windows only opened partly due to the fact that we were on the floor
