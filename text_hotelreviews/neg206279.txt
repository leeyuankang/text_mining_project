my son and his partner were competing in the london marathon and requested an early breakfast but the staff said they could not supply it before we have stayed in hotels in london before and they have promoted an early marathon breakfast this spoilt our whole stay as we had to dash out to local supermarket and buy yogurts serial etc for them to fuel up perhaps you could think again before another year there are people competing in this event
