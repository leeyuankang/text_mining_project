check in even though i had prepaid my stay because i had a new debit card different to the one booked they refunded and then recharged me the recharge would take a couple of days to hit my account which didn t impress me i would have been happier if they had charged me on the new card so that they had insurance backup and not to have inconvenienced me as this took a while to sort out
