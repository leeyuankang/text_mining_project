the room was tiny and the window looked straight into another room but there were no net curtains or venetian blinds so we had to keep the curtains shut as did all the rooms opposite the floorboards in the corridor and stairs were very noisy and we were woken up at as the door in the corridor made a lot of noise it claims to be stylish but it s a bit less smart once you head down the corridor to the rooms for breakfast is expensive if you only want cereal or toast many hotels offer a continental breakfast for a lower price
