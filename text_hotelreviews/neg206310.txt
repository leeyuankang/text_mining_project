i really didn t like the fact that you had to pay for your stay in full during check in i don t remember ever having to pay for a multi day hotel stay in full on check in normally most good hotels will take your card details and usually block out a certain amount during check in and then you pay your bill on check out but not this one i spoke to the staff about it and they said sorry that s our policy i can only imagine the ownership of the hotel have a low opinion of their guests and they must think their guests will disappear without paying which is a strange assumption given that they take your card details during your booking my position on this is on a point of principle only dishonest people expect others to be dishonest you have a pretty decent hotel don t ruin the guest experience by tacitly treating guests like scoundrels especially not at the prices you charge for your rooms
