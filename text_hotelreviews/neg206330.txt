we booked the property because it advertise free parking when we arrived there were no parking spaces available there were not enough parking spaces for the hotel advertise free parking without a warning there was only extremely limited street parking in the area with a hour limit we had to park in a multi storey car park quite a distance away there is no way i would have booked this hotel if i had know there was really no chance of getting parked
