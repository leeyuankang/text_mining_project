overall no problems with the room was exceptionally clean and had plenty of storage unfortunately the room was very noisy sound from the tv in room next door was very loud not ideal when trying to sleep also floor of above room made annoying loud creaking noises everytime the occupants moved about hopefully the staff would have provided a quieter room if i had been staying longer
