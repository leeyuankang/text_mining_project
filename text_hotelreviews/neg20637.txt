the room was very small way too small for a couple despite requesting for a larger room in response to the general manager s welcome email no effort was made to find us a larger room complimentary bottle water was provided only on arrival but there is a charge for additional water which is not the norm in europe the hotel was little more than a serviced apartment location was convenient and close to historic tourist sites and access to public transport there is major construction work going on opposite the hotel and around the precinct not a huge inconvenience but not a pretty sight
