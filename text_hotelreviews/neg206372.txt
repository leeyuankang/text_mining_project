didn t think the room should have been called executive more of a standard room there was not a lot of space and it was very gloomy other than the bathroom the water was tepid in the morning due to a fault for which the receptionist apologised it would have been a nice gesture to have been offered a cup of coffee at least as a gesture there were no instructions on how to use either the phone or the coffee machine in our room
