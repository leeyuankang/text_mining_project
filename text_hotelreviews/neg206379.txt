wasn t a bad experience but due to work being carried on hotel the corridors were dusty from work dust and visually not very pleasing we were told that we had been upgraded from executive to superior executive no idea what that meant the room did not warrant being described as superior executive xno bath was expecting one no kettle or tea facilities in the room bed was extremely hard
