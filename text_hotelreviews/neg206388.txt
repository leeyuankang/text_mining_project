it s was clear some of the staff didn t understand what we were saying which made things difficult especially when ordering food which always turned up wrong and usually cold burger first night was extremely undercooked then pancakes were rubbery and lukewarm but the worst was the english breakfast which turned up completely cold really disappointing as it s a nice hotel the staff are helpful i can t even speak another language so i appreciate most of the staff trying but i think that it is important to have staff in a hotel in england that can understand english properly
