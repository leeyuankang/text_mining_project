we have always stay at the lodge when visiting putney all the rooms we have stayed in in the past have been great but this time it was the complete opposite on this occasion very noisy from the room above just foot steps back and forth across the room and planes from early hours of the morning where the rooms at the front of the hotel are very quite also a little disappointed about the building work still going on when we were told it would be finished by now this impacts the number of parking spaces that is the most unique selling point to staying at the lodge with free parking where we have found the premier inn over the bridge for the same price including the parking charge with more parking spaces available
