the room was small as compared to other hotels in that price point also my room was in the basement of this hotel pitch black when you get off the elevator automatic lights do turn on after you exit the elevator but they are really dim no windows in the room with that said i do not know what above ground rooms look like so to be fair if my room were on another floor it might have been perfect
