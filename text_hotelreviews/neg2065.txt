booked a club room when we arrived the room was under the main street and didn t even have any windows hardly star and what you expect from a club room then we asked to be moved in the second room we didn t receive the complimentary dressing gowns bottles of wine or fruit platter that you were suppose to get with a club room also when going to shower ready for the theatre at there was no hot water which meant us having to have a freezing cold shower the club room bar they advertise is actually the only bar and the same as everyone else you just go through a different door to get to it with the label club lounge on it and we got charged for everything we had in there so don t see the point in having it or the difference in what you get for paying for a better room tottlag a waste of good money spent
