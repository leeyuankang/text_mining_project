we arrived having booked a family room for ourselves and our teenage daughter and checked in around only to be told by the receptionist that our room was not available and they would transfer us to one of their sister hotels about half an hour s drive away apparently the reason for this was that they were undergoing some renovation which meant that family rooms were not available this alternative was not acceptable to us as we had deliberately selected the location close to a restaurant where we were having a family get together we had to stand our ground and be extremely firm before being grudgingly offered a double room and a single room in lieu of the family room we had booked the receptionist was extremely unhelpful
