the double deluxe room they gave me was the size of shoe box nothing like advertised in the pictures the true designation would ve been extra small single room it also reeked of cheap perfume that they used to cover up bad smells sewage smells in the room and also in the hallway it was such a strong smell that not even hours of air conditioning ventilation helped it fade away the mattress on the bed was also very poor quality like it was years old why would you pay a night for a fake star hotel which in reality is a dated star hotel when you can stay at hotels like premier inn or holiday inn which are star but look much better than this one and have far more spacious rooms extremely comfortable beds and great locations all throughout london don t be stupid use your money wisely i would never come back to this hotel or recommend it to anyone it s a ripoff
