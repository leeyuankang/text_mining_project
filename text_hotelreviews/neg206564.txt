the first room we were given was such a disappointment it was even smaller than a single room there was no way we could fit into that we could not even open our medium size suitcase we immediately requested an upgrade and the next morning we were transferred into a club room which was not much bigger but at least we could open our suitcase all rooms are small apparently in future we can not come back to this hotel with our toddler because of the rooms size
