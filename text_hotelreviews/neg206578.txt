when arriving we were told my deposit was not allowed to be used as part payments so good job i had my credit card with me because they would not accept my debit card because there was not enough funds in there because they kept what i already had paid and reimbursed me when i got home if i hadn t had my credit card we would not have had enough money to pay the hotel and have nowhere to stay
