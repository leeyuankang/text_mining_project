the deluxe double room is far from it don t be impressed by the pictures it s okay for one person but not for two people the bed is too small for two people it s more like a good size single bed or a very narrow double the carpet is not so clean needs replacement we first had a room in the ground floor and got some reasons a huge bright orange industrial dehumidifier was in the middle of the room we laughted and wanted it romoved but got offered another room the second room room was so small that the very small bed needed to be against the side wall and window blocking the curtains the shower is on the small side too my boyfriend could barely fit inside we asked for another room no other room available si we were offered to go back in the first room and they removed to deshumidifyer this room was a tiny bit larger the bed wasn t against the wall and had a bedside table so it was an improvement the carpet was wet though in total we had wasted between the moment we checked in to the montent we settled it was almost we didn t have luggage just bag but just so you know wardobe is okay for a suit and two coats but do not expect to have the space and the practicality to store what s in your suitcase
