room was extremely small i though i booked a double room but i hot a sigle room the type of room didnt show up in my booking confirmation so make sure you check if you are booking i know its an old victorian building but when i say small i mean really small there is hardly space to keep you luggage and you an hardly move in it let alone work this is the only drawback of the place expect a small hotel with very little common area and small breakfast room
