the room we had deluxe room it was incredibly small we could not open our suitcases on the floor because there was so little space the bed was very small it was terrible to sleep together in the bed we were two we were disappointed the pictures that we saw of the room was very nice on booking com but we were shocked when we arrived because this should be a star hotel we complained after one night in the room we were in and got a slightly larger room with a slightly larger bed but i am in lenght and my feet were off the bed it was better then the first room but not as good as they say on booking com we were on this trip to relax and have a good time at the hotel but we were disappointed by the rooms we slept not well and it was a bad smell upwards shower i would not recommend to go to this hotel to relax this is a great hotel for one to go where the beds are very little for people and i found on the floor a pill when we arrived but i throw it away it was nasty i will not go on this hotel again i ve been in london before and been in star hotel near oxford streete and there were larger space and much better rooms and beds this hotel should not be star hotel the only thing they should get a star for is the staff and the internet i am wery disappointed of the stay there
