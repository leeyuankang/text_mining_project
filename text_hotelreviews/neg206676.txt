upgraded to club room not a good room felt like we where in the store cupboard so small bed hard pillows hard furniture dark and chiped pealing carpet had a ball of hair on it on arrival and crumbs on floor toilet roll should be quilted not cheap thin paper window might as well be left open as can hear every bit of noise outside room is right opposite the lift like two feet away so got very little sleep with people coming and going all night talking out side of bedroom door
