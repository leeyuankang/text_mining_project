the room was extremely small from the photo we saw on the website is very deceiving there is only one stool with the dressing table and most of the time we have to sit on the bed you can hardly have any space on the dressing table as they put the tea making facilities there one thing that worries us the most was the room we occupied has a bath tub and it is very dangerous when you want to get out for it the rail was at one side and there is no hand rail when we want to get out of it either of us has to be there to hold our hands to help one out i don t think i will come again
