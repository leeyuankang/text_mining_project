although the money for the price of the hotel was cashed by the hotel more than one month before through my credit card i had to show it to them and they copied my credit card at the arrival otherwise they told me i would not have got the room i showed them the statement of the bank on my name that the money had already been cashed but they insisted they wanted my card
