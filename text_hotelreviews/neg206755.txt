the double bed mattress was very hard and if one person moved the other would bounce the bedroom was not easy to negotiate for a disabled person as it had steps the person in the room could not see the tv a small one next to bed would have been great some kind of curtain to pull across for privacy from the single bed to double the draws in the room were difficult to open no view whatsoever from the window even if it was just some flower pots would have been lovely
