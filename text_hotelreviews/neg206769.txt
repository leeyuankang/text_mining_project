we stayed in a standard double room which we knew was going to be small but didn t realise how small the bed although stated as a double was not a standard double as it was much shorter in length as my fianc s legs dangled of the end another downfall if that our room was in the basement so our view from the window was of the stairs this also meant that at i was woken to what i presume to be a delivery with noise of people and items moving up and down those stairs
