room is very neat and has everything you need except space i knew from the other reviews that it would be small but didn t expect it to be so cramped we had pieces of luggage and used every surface space of the room the bed was also smaller than usual not more than wide the bathroom size is ok we didn t use breakfast price was too high and more fun to eat out
