everything they tried to send us to another hotel we also heard them say this to three other people however because we made a fuss they miraculously found a room it was tiny bashed about the air conditioning didn t work bed was not double my husband had to climb over me to get out of bed the shower leaked and tv had terrible signal we were moved the next day to a club room which was adequate we paid for a deluxe room it wasn t even the club room was basic the bedrooms need a complete makeover and generally better customer service the staff don t acknowledge you when you walk through the reception we never complain but feel that the hotel s poor standards put a real damper on our weekend away and people may like to know that they could try to move you to a different hotel if possible we think it may be in case of footfall bookings
