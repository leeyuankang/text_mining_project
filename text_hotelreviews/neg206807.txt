the check in experience was really poor and i thought that i wasn t going to get the room i d booked and they d confirmed the servicing of the room also left a bit to be desired on the first day the milk was off on the second day they didn t leave any the locale is also noisy if you have a room at the front of the property the room was smaller than average for the hotels i ve stayed in when i ve visited london
