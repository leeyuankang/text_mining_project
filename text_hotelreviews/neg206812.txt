it s not a hotel as advertised check in was a little confusing i d already paid on booking but was asked to sign the receipt and show photo id which i didn t have i wasn t told i d need it either when booking so i was asked for the card i d used when booking this was then swiped by one of those awful old machines nothing strange there you think it s commonly requested for extras such as bar mini bar only to discover later there s neither i was asked if we d like to book breakfast so i had to get my card out again to pay for it in a chip and pin machine so i m really not sure why it needed to be swiped breakfast experience was awful no one there to greet seat us so we just sat a young woman came over with a pad in her hand and asked for our room number then pushed it in front of me saying sign here then disappeared she didn t ask if we d had breakfast there before or ask if we needed anything in fact i don t even recall her saying hello we just found plates cutlery etc for ourselves tea and coffee is out of a machine as too is juice it s reconstituted and far too watered down it was like orange squash there was a chalkboard offering an asian breakfast which sounded delicious and another offering crepes porridge etc but nobody came anywhere near us so if we d wanted it we couldn t have had it absolutely terrible
