my room was impossibly small even thought it was supposed to be a double room i am not sure how you would ever get people in that room you couldn t i had a small suitcase and there was barely room to open it i had to wedge it open between the wall andthe bed i also had to walk sideways to get past the desk and the wall and the bed and the wall good possibly for one night or if you just plan to sleep and then leave each day but not suitable if you want a confortable place to hangout or for longer stay
