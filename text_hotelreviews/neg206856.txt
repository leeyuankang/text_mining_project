bed too high for ft chinese like my daughter and myself bed too hard you had to shuffle sideways to move around in the toilet there was no place to hang your clothes and towel in the toilet when having a shower i had to put the towel on the bed piece of glass on shower serves no useful function apart from preventing extra toilet roll from getting wet the floor was soaking anyway when we finished our shower because the piece of glass is situated at the curvature of the bathtub and you cannot stand on the curve the water went everywhere an adult couple would not find the room very comfortable as i was travelling with a child it was just about bearable
