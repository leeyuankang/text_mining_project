would have loved to been able to open a little window for some fresh air rather than the air conditioning i would suggest maybe putting lock bars on the window so it can open to a certain extent could do with a full length mirror where there is more lighting rather than on the back door of the wardrobe aslo the lights of the kitchenette and the wardrobe decided themselves when they wanted to come on not when we actually want them to come on lol
