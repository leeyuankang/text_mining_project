the room although we were told was an upgrade to club class was very small the noise from the air conditioning units outside the window was very loud even with the windows closed in addition the noise from the toilet above the room off of the stairway was very disturbing particularly at am waking us up the room was very stuffy and because of the noise from outside the windows could not remain open and the air conditioning within the room was far to noisy to have switched on on reporting the problem we were told that we were in the biggest room they had and that we could be moved into a smaller one needless to say we stayed where we were and put up with inconvenience although the location suited our requirements for this trip we would not repeat the experience
