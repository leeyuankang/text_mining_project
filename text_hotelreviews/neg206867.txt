we got given a free upgrade but it certainly didn t feel like it would have been much better than any of the other rooms our view was of a concrete wall with the air conditioning condensers right outside made it very difficult to sleep the pillows were either extremely flat or way too big the remote didn t turn the t v on but worked for changing channel etc if they never said it was a free upgrade i probably wouldn t have had a problem with these things
