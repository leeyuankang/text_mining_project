the room was incredibly tiny to the point where you couldn t open the door of the minibar because the bed was in the way the ac made a terrible noise on the last night and we had to turn it off to be able to sleep but then the room got really hot staff was nice and helpful but there was one night when we wanted to order some food and a bottle of water and they ordered a pizza for us and told us we could have water from the reception if we had ordered the water it would have cost instead we got water from the reception and paid the photos on booking com show a basket of fruit for the kind of room we booked and there was no such thing
