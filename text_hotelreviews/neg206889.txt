where to begin the rooms are tiny i stayed in a single room and it was by far the smallest hotel room i have ever experienced the single bed was not full size and i could not lie down entirely the wardrobe that reduced the size of the bed would not open fully as there was a wall in the way and did not have capacity to hang a suit and shirt the staff were incompetent my business trip plans changed a number of weeks in advance of the stay as such i would be staying for rather than nights when i informed the hotel of my change in plans weeks in advance of my stay they advised that the extra night could not be refunded as i had selected an advance purchase rate this is a fair position however when i suggested that perhaps there was something else they could do for me upgrade room for night etc as i would be paying for nights but only staying for i was simply told no very poor customer service and they simply sought to take advantage of the change in my plans without thought for the customers position upon arrival i sought to pay with the business card that i had used to book the hotel the staff were unable to facilitate this and i had to use my personal card to pay for the nights of which i only used on my personal card again the staff were extremely unhelpful upon proceedings to check out after night the reception staff could not understand that i was not staying the second night despite the fact that i had advised the hotel weeks in advance and at check in that i would only be staying night the staff at check out were unable to provide an invoice for my stay and were again entirely unhelpful to the situation the hotel needs to invest in staff training as a matter of urgency in addition to review of the room size and layout my one night was simply an awful experience and i will not be returning
