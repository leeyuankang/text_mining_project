false advertising on hotel part the hotel and room i was assigned to was totally different from what was advertised the hotel staff only informed me that my room will not be at shaftesbury but at another hotel a few blocks down after i have made my payment for the nights i could not back out at that point in time very sly and totally not professional booking com shouldnt allow such establishments to advertise there as a consumer i felt totally cheated and the room was very narrow that i could not even open my luggage properly otherwise room was clean a very bad first booking with booking com certainly not worth the money i paid for
