i stayed in this hotel for a weekend away with my partner and some friends it was brilliant that they hold your bags for you before you can check in and when you check out this is a lovely hotel however we was given a single room the beds are nothing like the pictures we got given a single bed for two and they refused to do anything about it i had an awful nights sleep my two friends were transferred to the shaftesbury premier because of electrical faults in there room and that was much better than this one
