don t expect all the amenities of a club room from lounge hours or wine bowl of fruit per their website we were in a club room and did not get wine fruit we did not care about this but we were disappointed that the club lounge was not consistent supposed to be nightly not always open during stated hours did not complain as we were always about to go out it became a running joke for us to see if it was open but it would be an issue if you expect it
