the superior bed was actually single beds so the gap in the middle was really annoying we could also hear something in the evenings an early mornings above us which sounded a lot like a really loud washing machine the staff were very good an gave us another small room just so we could sleep there if we wanted to so although this did solve the issue it was a pain having our stuff in one room an sleeping in another we didn t want to move our stuff in that room as it was simply too small
