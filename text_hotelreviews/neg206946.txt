first of all the rooms were too small there is no sofa or chair to sit if you open your suitcase on the floor you literaly no place to walk around so you have to jump over it the bed is too small for two people that was really uncomfortable with the worst thing in london was this hotel there is no place to hang your towel in the bathroom and that s just one example to emphasize the size breakfast room is in the basement so there is no windows
