room was too small shower was awkwardly situated with the shower head too low staff at the front desk was friendly but quite consumed with talking to each other and not paying enough attention to the people standing at the front desk one staff member hung up the front desk phone and immediately started laughing and making jokes about the caller with the others at the front desk while i was standing there that was very unprofessional
