the first thing i didn t like was that there wasn t one room available upon check in at on a saturday morning but it was carnival weekend so i understand they were busy the main thing that i didn t like was that after i did check in that they try to stick you in the worst room first when you ask to change they stick you in another room i went from the back alley room off the lobby to the floor room next to the elevator it was just annoying that they do that especially as a solo female traveler i read other reviews where they did the same thing to others i think it s really bad hospitality they told me i could look at a third room but by that time i was just annoyed and thankfully the room next to the elevator was quiet you couldn t hear it and there wasn t a lot of people or loud people constantly using it so it was easy to sleep through the night
