room was absolutely tiny and had a very strong unpleasant smell the whole time i was there no information on hotel facilities or the nearby area was provided by staff on check in and there was none provided in the room i needed to use the safe which did not work and needed maintenance to come out to it twice staff on reception were pleasant enough but when i asked really quite basic questions about how to get where i needed to be they did not know london well enough to answer booked because it was relatively cheap and now realise you get what you pay for
