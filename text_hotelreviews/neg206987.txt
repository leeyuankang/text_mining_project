this room was advertised and booked as a deluxe double room single would have described it better the bed was right next to the window so one person had to get into the bed from the end or crawl over the other person there was a suitcase stand in the room but nowhere to use it we had to open our case on the floor directly behind the door good job we didn t have to evacuate in a hurry would not book again
