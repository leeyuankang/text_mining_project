well there is rather a lot i didn t like firstly my room was flipping miles away it was in a separate wing i had to be escorted there up the lift to the first floor walk for miles across a footbridge find another lift up to the fourth floor walk for miles again getting back to reception was a nightmare i went a different way every time and often in circles i know women have no sense of direction allegedly but this was ridiculous then i was in a very small room with a chipped bath tiny dirty windows loose electrical parts hanging down in the wardrobe and dusty instead of hanging a do not disturb on the door there is a small touch panel you are supposed to press near the bathroom that says if you want to be cleaned or not i didn t even know it was there no instructions anywhere and must have pressed it in the night unseen so they didn t even clean my room on day the bathroom has the most complicated set up with no taps and an automatic bathplug that has to be prised out with your fingers as it doesn t work so you gingerly twist a chrome blob and the hand shower whacks you in the face full pelt no instructions anywhere and you shouldn t need a manual to run a bath all the surfaces in this tiny room were covered with things to make you spend more money i don t need four wine glasses menus corkscrews bottles of wine tubs of nuts etc etc the fridge is full of overpriced alcohol that i don t want how about putting a small carton of fresh milk in there montcalm and reception is full of snooty staff who can t break a smile and don t even ask you how your stay went all this joy for a night without breakfast unfortunately i have to stay there again as my company is hosting an event and we will be taking rooms it had better improve or there will be fireworks
