apparently the hotel had been rented for a wedding party the night of our stay our room sat over that party which lasted well over midnight the music vibrated the walls of our room keeping us from sleeping then to add insult to injury as staff left the hotel at they stood beneath our window on the street loudly visiting with each other at times yelling and joyfully screaming this lasted for at least minutes they apparently failed to consider that they were standing underneath guest rooms our window to the street was very poorly insulated and so all sound from the street was audible the next problem was the dearth of usb outlets and universal plugs we had to keep the bathroom light on all night in order to use the plug in it to charge our devices very disruptive
