initially the room we went to first was small and there was a loud noise outside in street so we couldn t sleep however very helpful staff upgraded us to a club room which was more spacious and quiet it was done quickly and we were impressed with how the staff responded also no spa facilities for a hotel unless you are a montcalm club member and can access the ones at the other montcalm hotel
