photos are misleading we had booked a large double room which i refused to accept when i saw it it was barely big enough for a kid we were moved to a larger room where if you put two suitcases on the floor you can t walk pass through to the bathroom anymore you cannot open the windows in this hotel due to safety reasons we were told so at the reception so you ve got two options either suffocate or put on the a c i would consider the second one if the a c wasn t blowing directly at my head while sleeping the kitchenette and nespresso coffee machine is a good touch if we had more space to actually enjoy it
