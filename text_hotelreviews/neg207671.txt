reception staff were cold and indifferent on check in slightly better on check out given the room was paid for and credit card details given was there really any need to take copies of photo id of a british citizen the bed had a cheap open coil mattress putting a lovely topper on the bed does not solve the issue of a dip being created in the middle of a cheap mattress if one person weighs more than the other this outdated style also means there is excessive mattress movement everytime someone turns over generally good hotels use hand side stitched pocket sprung or memory foam for this reason the lounge area was tiny and uncomfortable not everyone wants their social space option to be the noisy pub the coffee in the room was little instant packets at the room price point i d expect nespresso or krups
