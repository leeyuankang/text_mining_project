i booked a room at the montcalm at the brewery but was upgraded to one of their hotels minutes away which was annoying on counts i had parked my car on the barbican car park before i found out about my upgrade only for the other hotel to have an ncp right outside it so had to walk mins to pick my car up and i wanted to stay at the montcalm at the brewery which is why i booked there poor show really
