our room was very small and very dark the mattress was not very good and could have been firmer the room was very dark even when we opened the curtains view was a wall so no light could get in anyway we were told at reception that we had been given an upgrade and i can t help wondering what a lower grade room would have been like i think that we should have been taken to our room by the most direct route rather than via two lifts and several corridors and steps fortunately we found the shorter route afterwards as directed by the staff member who took us to the room
