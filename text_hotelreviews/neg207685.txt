i booked at the hotel not with city rooms i expected to be in the main part of the hotel not the further most distance from the facilities at one point i was offered a room in a different building entirely up the road which was totally unacceptable this made it exceptionally and painfully difficult for me due to an injury to move around the hotel and i was indeed restricted to my room after arrival by this there was no other chair in the room apart from an unstable office type chair
