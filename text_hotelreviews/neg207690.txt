couldn t get a table for dinner in jugged hare until friday which was no good as we travelled a long time and the phone wasn t answered in the chiswell rooms not great if these are the hotel eateries looking slightly worn room carpet stains and worn desk chair fabric finally asked for a room with a bath and didn t get a reply at all in a whole week ended up with a nice shower as it was a disabled room so large wet room but not what we wanted check in and out queues substantial in the end i walked out and emailed the hotel about our extras the two concierge stood waiting to help should be able to check out guests and the check in process is unduly long
