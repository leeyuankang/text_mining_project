reception area was cold our bathroom was even colder the club lounge was very poor understaffed and seriously underpriced poor selection and not enough of continental breakfast and not enough seating to accommodate those of us who had paid for extra comfort and service very disappointing to have the main restaurant shut at weekends was surprising and to not have an internal bar lounge equally as surprising
