stayed in a club room it was small compared to executive rooms in many other hotels the bathroom too small too no natural light in the room a small window decor could be better there was only one mirror in the room by the desk would have liked to have a separate shower too the desk area was taken up by the telephone mobile and sound speaker was not told that the hotel has a steamroom and sauna before or during my stay
