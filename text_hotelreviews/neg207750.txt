concierge seemed to have very limited knowledge of specific restaurants nearby for us to enjoy and sent us to a chain restaurant cote which was certainly not the experience we were looking for he seemed disengaged and disinterested the hotel has two restaurants one of them was closed for renovations which we were not made aware of the only other option was the jugged hare which is solely for meat eaters not ideal for a vegetarian they had only one non meat option which was incredibly bland and disappointing three pieces of fruit were left in our room for our consumption however the fruit was old and past its time our room on the floor had very small windows and was very dark room itself was ok it had no interesting design elements or personality which is a shame as the history of the hotel lends itself to such possibilities
