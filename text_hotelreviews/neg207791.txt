but don t have breakfast breakfast was a travesty we had to ask or times for cutlery drinks etc and they had run out of mushrooms and brown bread and had congealed under cooked bacon every member of waiting staff just yes when we asked for anything and then never returned the chef was excellent cooking special requests to order and the food he produced was great the hotel handled the problem really well and offered a full refund of the cost of the breakfast which i did not request
