looking at the great reviews from others it seems to be something of a lottery how your stay will go dependent on which room you re given the room we had was so small even by london standards and dark that it was difficult for two people to get ready together without bumping in to each other there was also so much stuff in the equally tiny wardrobe and bathroom already that it was actually difficult to hang anything up or put your toiletries down the water system or something similar overhead also made a considerable noise and kept me awake for part of the night the hotel is something of a maze and we managed to get lost between the room and reception twice as the signage isn t also helpful as a side note it s also a little odd that anyone can walk into the hotel bedroom corridors bypassing reception through the wide open door in the pub next door without being checked i suspect that if we d had a slightly bigger quieter room i d be giving this close to a ten however a hotel with five star aspirations really shouldn t be hit or miss in that way we tend to go back again to hotels we trust but it seems unlikely we ll visit here again the person on reception didn t ask how our stay was when we checked out so perhaps that doesn t matter
