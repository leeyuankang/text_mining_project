we stayed here on the weekend and found the local area extremely quiet struggled to find restaurants etc so had to travel probably better suited to weekday business travellers staff were helpful however we felt we were being stared at spoken about behind ours backs by some staff that clearly had a snooty attitude their problem not ours didn t ruin my visit
