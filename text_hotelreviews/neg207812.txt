the only person who spoke passable english was the doorman the lady who greeted us at the reception was not only incredibly rude but also very unhelpful and at times hard to understand the chap who showed us to our room while very nice also did not speak a lot of english the complimentary fruit basket consisted of one pear the staff member who showed us to our room remarked upon this fact with pronounced embarrassment and promised to have it refilled immediately sadly this solitary pear was with us for the entire duration of our three day stay it never received any fruity or other companions the complimentary bottles of mineral water were non existent both of these water and fruit were advertised to us on numerous occasions however we never actually had the pleasure of enjoying either of them repeated complaints to various staff members achieved nothing all in all it was not a horrible experience but one that could have been had at a much cheaper hotel with much less disappointment after all if you stay in a five star hotel you expect a certain something and that was most assuredly lacking
