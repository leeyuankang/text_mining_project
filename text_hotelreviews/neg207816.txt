the receptionist at check in was extremely miserable and made our first impression not a good one she did not explain any facilities at all to us breakfast times nothing at all we were standing at the desk for a few minutes while she was doing something on the computer and did not even acknowledge our presence or say sorry one moment please i ve worked in a hotel and would get fired if my manager knew i was treating guests like that worst of all we walked mindlessly around looking for the restaurant there was a bar restaurant next to our room but too loud for us so we went to reception to ask about the other restaurant to which the same rude receptionist said what was wrong with the other one i replied we just wanted a quiet meal we were so offended it was almost as if she didn t want us there and looked down on us apart from that every other single member of staff we encountered was lovely and so helpful and the food was so impressive
