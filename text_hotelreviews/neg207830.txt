when booking the hotel make it very difficult to book with a company card when i asked to do this i was to provide a whole host of private information and after this was sent they did not fulfill the wish to pay with the card and charged the traveller instead when asked about this there was little acknowledgement of the inconvenience caused and when they finally responded they barely apologised and just signed off with the barest of responses too expensive a place to stay considering the fallow customer service experience very disappointed but sadly all to common in such places
