i had booked two rooms for us and our daughter who arrived later on the august and left on the i paid for both rooms in full on arrival and yet when my daughter arrived she was charged again before she could gain access to the room it was rectified the following morning but it was annoying when we checked out on the i was told that i hadn t paid for breakfast for our room although i paid for everything on arrival i had to go back to reception when we collected our bags as it was going to be investigated further again it was rectified and i was told there was nothing further to pay but it was annoying and inefficient the reception staff are lovely but the administration seems muddled the coffee at breakfast in the jugged hare was always cold horrible
