staff sat on stair eating their breakfast as guest pass by breakfast being in a nearby pub not being told before booking that was the case and then having booked being told we had not paid when sat in the pub awful poorly handled and we left communication is everything and much is lost in translation when there is a language barrier suggest you get some indigenous staff pl saw don t take that the wrong way but it made everything hard work
