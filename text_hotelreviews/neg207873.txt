our room also faced the inside courtyard area where there were floodlights on even the thick curtains weren t enough to darken the room i would suggest they turn them off or use dimmer lights at night so light sleepers can doze off more easily they also have a marquee set up in the courtyard for events but i guess the guests were moved inside later in the evening so it was still quiet
