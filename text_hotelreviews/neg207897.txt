bit of a maze inside and a little dated needs a lick of paint and more attention to the small details for instance in our room the window might as well have not been there as it was very thin and there were gaps where you could feel the wind coming through just get double glazing and stuff like the curtains not going far enough to cover the window or plonking a big out of date radio next to the bed that didn t even work properly also we were a little bit angry when the breakfast staff started clearing up and laying dinner service while we were still eating our breakfast and we weren t slow eaters but felt rushed and in the way which for a star hotel is actually horrendous please don t get me wrong though it was a lovely place to stay it just needs somebody to go through it and sort out the little things that are either unnecessary or impractical and for the kitchen and dining staff to show a little more respect for their guests
