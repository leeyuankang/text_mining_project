the courtyard is lovely though it would have been nice if it had actually been possible to have drinks in the marquees set up there they must be reserved for special events the only criticisms i have of our stay are that the walls are a bit thin so when the other guests came in around on both nights we could clearly hear the closet doors and the sound of conversation also our room had only one bath towel which we only realised after emerging from the shower and there was no bottle opener or corkscrew for the minibar the free bottle of water and the evening chocolates were appreciated but we only had them on the night of our arrival i rather expected that these would be there on the second night as well all minor points
