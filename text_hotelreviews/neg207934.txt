confusion booking in and out we booked an extra night took ages to explain when checking in told she understood the following day after going out and returning with bags found we were locked out of the room another long explanation and again on check out rooms are small the chair at the desk is too big smaller ones would help breakfast really expensive and need to go next door restaurant next door closes at the weekend so the pub is the only option
