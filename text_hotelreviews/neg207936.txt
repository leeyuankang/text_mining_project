the whole hotel had the feel of somewhere that had been given a cheap makeover to make it look more expensive that it was there was poor attention to detail e g on arrival in room we found the fabric on the desk chair to be ripped evidence of poor quality repairs in bathroom the classic double was the smallest hotel room i have ever stayed in made worse by the tiny windows situated high up the wall the hotel is a labyrinth and guests are provided with a poorly designed map to navigate
