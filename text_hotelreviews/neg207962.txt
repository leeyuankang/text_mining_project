in order to charge our mobile phones overnight we had to keep the key card in place to ensure a flow of electricity to the room unfortunately this meant that we couldn t switch off the light above the tea coffee making section we also felt it was dangerous to not have any lights on at all if you needed to get up in the night also although the pillows were changed to non feather pillow they were rock hard and very uncomfortable we hardly slept due to the light being continually on and the rock hard pillows breakfast was very over priced as you couldn t have a small breakfast like coffee toast without paying an excessive amount we bought fresh croissants from tesco around the corner instead
