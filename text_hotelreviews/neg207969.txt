requested on booking and early check in for a room in quiet area was provided a room in separate building over looking road so there was traffic noise air conditioning in room was too hot and many attempts to reduce temperature failed had to open window to reduce temp so road noise interumpted sleep when using shower water poured through ceiling light fitting next to shower very dangerous as possibility of electric shock as had to walk through pouring water and large puddle to get out of bathroom it took over mins for anything to be organised by hotel staff for me to use another rooms shower very poor communication this made me very late in my schedule so demanded a taxi to take me to my appointment which the hotel paid for something i guess no reduction of room rate to compensate for inconvenience
