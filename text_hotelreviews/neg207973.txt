we requested a quiet room and were placed away from the road which was great however what we didn t notice when we arrived but did when we were trying to get to sleep was that there were people continuously moving about above room floor all night there are no rooms available on this floor so presumably it was the staff it was noticeable enough to delay getting to sleep and to wake you up again during the night
