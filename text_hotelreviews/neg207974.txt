the hotel is huge confusing with long corridors on different levels and the signs are misleading signs to lifts and reception lead nowhere it is impossible to find your way around several staff members agreed but said there was nothing they could do the bathroom fittings are broken and the hot water system so complex it is impossible to use when i asked staff if they enjoyed working there they said no the hours are long and the pay is poor
