it s a very nice hotel for the price but not really a star we didn t like having to walk out of the hotel and to a pub for breakfast it doesn t tell you anywhere that this is the case the rooms are not soundproof you can hear the traffic at any time and creaking floorboards the staff was very friendly helpful when we arrived but after that anyone could have walked into the hotel despite a huge number of staff
