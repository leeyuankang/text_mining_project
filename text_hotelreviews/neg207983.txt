this is not a criticism more an observation as a tourist the hotel location is a little out of the way hence quiet at night however moorgate tube station is a mere minute walk away as is bank but be aware there is a large building site blocking a direct walk barbican tube is nearby too st paul s cathedral is a minute walk so overall the hotel is not badly placed but the location does not have a wow factor of for example overlooking a london landmark the river this is not an issue for me but may be for some
