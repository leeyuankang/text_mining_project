don t be deceived by the pictures of the bedrooms booked a double delux room but when we got to the room it now seems we actually had a compact double room though reception confirmed we had a delux after we complained about the room size however now re looking at photos of a compact double room that is what we had very small double single bed with no real cupboard space enough for shirts on either side of the bed some drawer space no room to put anything even your suitcase bathroom was a wet room did not pay for expensive breakfast and instead had breakfast on the way out in a cheaper cafe which are close by
