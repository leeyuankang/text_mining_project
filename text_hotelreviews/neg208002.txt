the room i stayed in was on the third floor and required a native guide to find we took the lift to i think the first floor walked across a bridge then took the lift to the second floor then climbed stairs to the room on the third floor taking the main lift to the third floor did not bring me to my room which was on the third floor but in a different wing from the reception area staff were extremely helpful and pleasant however the room had tiny recessed windows allowing no natural light in so the roof felt a bit claustrophobic
