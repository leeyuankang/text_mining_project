having reserved separate rooms for separate parties in advance i was surprised to find on the day before we were due to check in that the hotel had decided to deduct the full amount from my account without advising me or asking me for authority on the day of arrival i explained this to the check in staff they said they just blocked the amount that it hadn t left my account that they would only deduct the amount for my room however days after checking out my bank still shows the full amount as being deducted when i rang to query i was given some lame excuse about it being my banks fault will not stay here again
