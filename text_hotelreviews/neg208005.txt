the hotel is a little out of the way near the north side of the barbican centre and north of london walls in the city of london the area is a brewery conservation area and this hotel has been tastefully restored into a chic hotel however in my view it lacked atmosphere there was no communal area to relax with other guests unless you had booked a room which would give you access to a small lounge area but it was not available to all guests just a few the jugged hare pub next door is actually part of the hotel but operates as a normal pub with access by the general public straight from the street our room was situated directly over a set of traffic lights at quite a busy crossroads in chiswell street this meant we heard traffic all night long on the first night so be warned complained the next morning and was given a room across the road in the montcalm suites this was better and much quieter i m sure staff knew our original room was not quiet even though i had requested a quiet room i must say i have noticed this kind of treatment from other hotels where my booking had been made via booking com i am now convinced some hotels give booking com customers reduced service including allocating less bookable rooms oh and one other thing there are some tables chairs located outside the montcalm suites on the day when we moved rooms we noticed a number of used drinking glasses on one of the tables when we checked out days later those same glasses were still there on the table why hadn t hotel staff noticed this and removed the glasses pretty poor in my view
