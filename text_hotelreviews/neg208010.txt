i didn t like being upgraded by an officious receptionist to what was to be a very dark no windows room across the road in another building which had the benefit of a kitchen we felt obliged to accept the room as we weren t offered anything else and didn t want to make a huge fuss when our reluctance wasn t already acknowledged by the receptionist however while i was out my husband had to ask for another room he never complains he couldn t get any work done because of the noise right outside our bedroom door which was the first room on the ground floor i am happy to get the room i book and pay for and don t like being fobbed off with something else just to suit the hotel it certainly didn t appear to be any kind of an upgrade if they don t like customers paying a reasonable rate for the rooms then they shouldn t advertise on booking com
