on arrival we were put in a very small room which we were not happy with we were then moved to the correct club room but we thought it was still quite dull looking but more spacious than the first room the first night we placed our breakfast card on the door for breakfast to our room the next morning we woke up early expecting breakfast between and opened the door to see if anyone was coming and noticed nobody had even taken our breakfast card so we had to phone reception so our breakfast was late and again was late the second morning very poor this year especially when our expectations where so high after a great time last year
