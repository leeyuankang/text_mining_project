i am afraid that the breakfast room which was at the back of the pub it was connected to didn t live up to my expectations of the actual hotel the staff on the sunday morning were not in correct attire for a star hotel and the room was over crowded with some guests having to wait for a seat or take hot plates of food up and down the stairs to an overflow seating area it is a shame that this let my stay down
