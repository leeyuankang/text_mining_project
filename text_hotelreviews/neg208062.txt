stay every year for last years last two years i have had email from montcalm a few days before date i was booked in for offering rate at over off room rate i had paid i booked thru booking com and was advised to book direct in future my experience this year was that doing so resulted in much the same higher rate offer i would hope regular guests would be given good rate your central reservations unit offered free breakfast which was welcomed but hopefully next years experience is better on initial booking
