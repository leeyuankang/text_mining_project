if you are not traveling alone in business mind i highly recommend to avoid this hotel we booked their double premium room as expected to have normal size bed and larger room what we get was smaller room than in description and the bed was less than wide and bumpy in center for two it was very difficult to sleep and caused backaches after two nights we got another room but there was no warm water in the shower only freezing cold in morning when we waited long for it to be fixed we lost our prebooked transportation to the airport and although they promised that manager will contact us later no contact or any compensation never visit there again if travel as couple
