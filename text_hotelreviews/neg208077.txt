let s face it it was not a five star hotel the rooms were small bathrooms shabby the first room we stayed in was extremely noisy even after i switched off the air conditioning the dirty window was facing the wall in the second room the tv set was not working properly after several request is was fixed though for the same value one can get a decent star hotel which will be both better located and nicer
