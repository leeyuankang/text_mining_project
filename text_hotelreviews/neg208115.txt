we arrived early around am and understandably no room was available so we left luggage we checked in and a room was allocated we specified a quiet room on the reservation asked for it when we arrived and were assured this not a problem all we needed was to pick up the key when we came back later spent all day and evening in london we got to the hotel at around pm picked up the key to go to our room and found out that our room was on the first floor right on top of a wedding party that when full blast on the floor below us nobody would have been able to sleep with that noise fortunately the receptionist agreed and was able to assign us to another room on the fourth floor away from the ballroom it ended ok but why were we assigned probably the noisiest room in the hotel that evening when we had requested a quiet room repeatedly
