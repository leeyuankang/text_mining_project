our room card keys kept not working and we kept having to take them to the front desk to be reset we were told not to put them near a credit card or cell phone which when put in a wallet when going out for the day where else should we have put them in any case when we had the room serviced the cleaning staff would turn the ac unit off and close the vent when we had turned it on so it would be cool when we returned for the evening we were also not provided with a room service menu at first and when we asked for one we were told to just call and ask for what we wanted then a menu turned up on the last night of our stay
