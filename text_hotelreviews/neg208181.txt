upgraded to one of the apartments on the opposite side of the road to the hotel and felt duped when assured we had at least been allocated the club double room we had originally booked the room was small with an unwanted kitchenette hardly conducive to a romantic one night stay there was no complimentary water or fruit on our arrival the tv was not working and the promised response to the inoperative tv never materialised no promised complimentary newspaper appeared the next morning and the advertised hermes toiletries were not provided in the bathroom breakfast was spoilt first by the waiters hurrying customers in their breakfast choices as there were apparently insufficient menus available and secondly by one of the waiters putting his hand right across my husband s plate to help himself to one of the jam pots to add to another table without even an explanation or an excuse me totally astounding rudeness
