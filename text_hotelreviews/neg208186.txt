the room i was given was one half of an adjoining room which is off putting and i could see the light from that room all night underneath the door the room was also extremely loud i kept waking up because of the sound of the road and traffic and the other guests slamming their doors also this is my third time staying here in as many months when i checked in this time the staff made me really uncomfortable they had notes on screen when i said my name and two members of staff were whispering about them in front of me they then took my card payment twice for reasons unknown i m a single traveller but they asked me several time if i was sure that i didn t want two cards it was a really uncomfortable check in and felt awkward and not friendly
