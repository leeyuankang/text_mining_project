this was a treat for the final nights of our honeymoon room was difficult to get to the lg exit was blocked by dishes from the kitchen the bath and shower were essentially useless and after a hour journey it took minutes to half fill a bath with lukewarm water the mechanism seemed totally impractical the room was good but cramped for two people the kettle area was particularly crowded with items but the fact that there was a kettle was a bonus the air conditioning unit outside the room made sleep very difficult the window was small and needed to be cleaned but in any case little light enters the room as it is feet away from the wall of the next building locating the light switches for corresponding lights was a bit of a project three requests before a second bathrobe came on evening of our stay
