we were given a handicaped room on arrival knowing well that we are fully abled people was very disappointed although we were moved to another room after our complaint the bathtub wasn t cleaned very often and there was no toilet brush to clean up when necessary we experienced difficulty with the light switch plus the lightning on the floor is unnecessary anoying the fridge was hot all the time and stunk when opened bedroom was stuffy and windows permanently locked
