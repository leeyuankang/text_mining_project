the hotel is getting old some staff members are not as professional aircondition didn t work housekeeping was poor didn t replace dirty cups lotions although replaced towels promptly complained once but they didn t address it when i told the staff as we checked out but the staff told me that i had to continue to let them know hmm once should be enough for them to address it i wouldn t recommend it to friends and i wouldn t go back there again the area has so many options near in good locations with similar prices
