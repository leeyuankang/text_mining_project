we d booked a junior suite and were originally assigned to one on the sixth floor which was a very different quality and type of room to the junior suites advertised on the hotel website i appreciate not all rooms can be photographed but the webpage should at least be indicative of the quality type of room you are booking the staff were helpful in moving us to a different room for the remainder of the stay however the room we were put in pictures provided looked like the deluxe room on the website while it was better than the room we were in it either wasn t a junior suite which raises questions around the equity of pricing for deluxe suites vs junior suites or the pictures on the website are very misleading
