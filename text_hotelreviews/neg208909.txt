we didn t have an open balcony a feature i was really looking forward to there was a lot of noise from an upstairs room one of the nights and upon telling reception in the morning i was not a fan of how they told me i could have called throughout the night and that there was nothing they could do i would have liked to have been offered some form of compensation for our stay as this is quite an expensive hotel per night i was made to feel a little like a silly child who had moaned about something ridiculous but at the end of the day this stay was a treat for me and my partner and not something i would usually splash out on so i was upset that i only got about hours sleep on my second night
