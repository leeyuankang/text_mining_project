not much i liked about this hotel false advertising on booking com do not book the superior double room you get a substandard double room unless you book the deluxe room do not consider this hotel no toilet paper on arrival in room had to go and ask twice before they brought me some room was cleaned only after sauna was never on so don t know if it was even working no clean glasses replacing dirty ones in the room had to also go and ask all in all i will never stay in this hotel again and do not recommend it at all to anyone one of the worst hotels i have ever stayed in don t know how it gets a star status
