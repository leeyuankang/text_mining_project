the first day they gave us a very huge room the size of the room was perfect but the windows were opened to a closed area i mean no view no light and the neighbors of the hotel was making a lot of noise so it was impossible to sleep we requested to move to another room the staff was first wasn t helpful then we said we would move to another hotel so they changed the room last room was small but beautiful at the end of the day it is a beautiful hotel but nothing extraordinary
