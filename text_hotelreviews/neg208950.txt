the first room on the annex floor had the most spectacular view of the eiffel tower and the bathroom was spacious and modern however and this is a big however the room itself was quite dismal and looked like a college dorm room very old and ugly furniture a picture of a huge flower in a frame no bedspreads i could go on and on not at all like picture on internet i did say in the nicest way i could to them that it was a shame that perhaps their room with perhaps the best view was so poorly furnished and decorated they switched us to another room on floor that was gorgeous be aware of particular room you are booking and even call the hotel to clarify we booked a suite but there is a huge dichotomy between suites when i asked the comanager about how to book the loveliest suite with the view rm she was evasive and made it seem almost impossible to book in advance i hope they spend a little money and redecorate that floor room asap
