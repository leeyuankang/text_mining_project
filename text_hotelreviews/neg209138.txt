this hotel is dirty and multiple rooms are bug infested my bed had many bugs in it i got horrible bites all over my face and on my back only from being in this bed for about minutes before i saw the bugs the toilet jammed almost every time i flashed spilling water on the bathroom floor wi fi in rooms not working no reach the rooms as well as the lobby are dark and depressing hotel staff does not speak sufficient english language to help the guests with many simple issues the experience from day was very aggravating and disappointing i was paris in business attending important event and meeting many business partners too bad i had to attend all meetings with burning red swollen face from the bugs bites disgusting and unbelievable i would like this review to be a warning to other people considering their stay at villa lutece bugs were found in more rooms another colleague who was staying in a different room on a different floor was bitten too this is below any standard and the stars which this hotel claims are absolutely not deserved and do not reflect the reality
