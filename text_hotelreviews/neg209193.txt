wifi in bedrooms on floor wasn t good would have liked the possibility to make tea coffee in the room meant that i had to ask for a cup of hot water at the bar which the bartender was happy to supply however the bar manager politely informed me that presumably as i was only drinking a hot unpaid for beverage i would be asked to vacate my seat if the bar became full
