in the words of my very laid back and low maintenance director my stay was less comfortable for the following reasons no iron or ironing board was available at the room i had to go to a quite filthy ironing room on the floor no television in english breakfast was very poor for eur you don t even get proper fried eggs wifi was below okay could not even have a skype conversation he never moans and this hotel was twice the price of the others we were looking at but gave the impression of being more comfortable and well looked after than the others what a mistake i won t be sending anyone there again
