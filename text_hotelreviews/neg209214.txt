the staff were rude and inconsiderate waking us up at am during our stay demanding payment despite making paying upfront for the night the following morning the manager even came up knocking on our door with security demanding payment and that we pay in the next minutes she did not even allow us time to freshen up imagine being young women in a foreign country being antagonised by hotel staff when i explained the situation she did not offer any any apologies for humiliating us and making us feel like thieves only that she cannot take our word for it and will liaise with her colleague who took the payment she also questioned us as to why we look dissatisfied and shocked apparently being woken up at am to loud knocks and being met by security for no valid reason is supposed to be normal although it was all rectified from their end in the end they did not apologise for the error and the inconvenience they caused us for no good reason avoid this hotel at all costs
