if a comfortable bed is your thing then i think this hotel is not for you i ended up with a really sore back after nights here there are simply not enough pillows and when i asked for more only pillows supplied in a suite for people there were no more available i was gobsmacked the staff told me that due to the hotel being full and other guests having stolen pillows they were not able to supply us with anything more than some towels sheets to try and lift the height of our pillow that didn t really do the trick so sadly comfort gets a low score from us it really did let the hotel down the jacuzzi was broken during our stay this was explained to us as we checked in and due to the bank holiday it would not be fixed during our stay not a major problem to be honest but a little disappointing
