the location is not that appealing however it s close to a metro station and if you are ok being far away from the touristic crowds you come to appreciate the area it also provides for finding good and much better value for money restaurants close the hotel the hotel in terms of room furniture and overall facilities does not give you the impression of a star hotel though the staff and breakfast make up for it
