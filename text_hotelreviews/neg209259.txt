the description of the room is blatant false advertising i booked a superior room to me superior means just that a step above the basic grade i agreed to pay a little bit more money than other hotels were offering rooms for on the basis that this was a superior room when we got to the room it was tiny the photos are very deceiving i rang down to reception to ensure that we were in the right room as i had booked a superior room i was informed that all paris hotel rooms are small and that superior is the lowest grade firstly i purposely went that little bit outside the centre and spent a bit more to avoid the tiny rooms and secondly there is no way that superior should mean the lowest grade of a room not at all happy with this were not offered any upgrade even though hotel was very quiet dissapopointed in this as i paid a lot of money for waht i thought was to be a superior room which was instead very basic would not recommend people to stay here a bottle of water was left in the room for each guest over the three days the room was cleaned every day and the empty bottles were let at the beside and were never replaced even though when we passed the trolleys on the corridor there were plenty of bottles not great service overall quite disappointed
