the rooms are a lot smaller than i expected we even had one of the superior rooms with a window which is a luxury in this hotel do not expect to be able to walk around the bed the reception staff were not particularly helpful with leaving luggage in fact they ended up leaving our luggage in the lobby even after asking them specifically to move it to the room really not happy especially after i walked in to the reception and waited at least for a member of staff to appear poor
