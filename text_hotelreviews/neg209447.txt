basement room no natural light my wife had to exit the building to check the mornings weather each day noisy due to staff in and out of adjoining door all night bathroom was functional but very small unable to sit properly on the toilet as it was almost up to the wall the shower was in the bath and you need a step ladder to get in and out the wardrobe rail was about high i am and my wife is smaller there are steps down into the room when you get through the door the safety deposit box repair man fell down them the staff don t appear to talk to each other as messages about us wanting to change room weren t relayed to the morning staff the receptionist did offer another room if we left out bags in the reception area the next morning before where she would watch them for us but on questioning this she stated that she would not be responsible for them and we did not want to waste the small amount of time we had in london trying to change room last time we stayed here it was reasonable but not this time the room was very hot despite having air conditioning it only worked on low fan speed and no matter what setting were made it didn t cool very much the corridor to the basement is enclosed by glass and smells awful when we were checking out the receptionist asked what complimentary offers where we given answer none were offered breakfast was not included and what we paid for the first morning was laughable the coffee was strong and almost cold the selection on offer was very poor we ate elsewhere the next morning
