upon check in i found the staff member to be quite rude very unhelpful and i received a number of blank stares from this particular worker who was slow the other worker checked people in during the time it took for us to be checked in and she was friendly and very informative unlike the girl we had the room was tiny not much room to move around at all but it was very clean and modern and was fine for what we wanted we had paid extra for the breakfast and were at no point told that this was only a cold buffet if you wanted a hot breakfast there was another additional charge for this the wait staff i found to be rude the milk smelt off on the table and i had to ask times to have different milk and i was met with the same blank rude stares i had been given at the check in desk the day before at for one night this was not value for money and was not somewhere i would recommend or return to again i am not picky and i am a firm believer in you get what you pay for but at the cost of this i would of expected much much better
