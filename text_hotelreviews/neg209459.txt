a room without a window honestly i felt trapped and i don t think i saw that on the description of the executive king room when i booked it i think it should be in there so people can choose the room was freezing cold when we entered and after a while we managed to turn it off but it took a bit until it was back in the normal temperature the bed wasn t king size either i think it was two separate beds joined together
