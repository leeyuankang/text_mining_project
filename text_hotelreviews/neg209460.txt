my bed was under a skylight at something dropped from that skylight and hit me on the face i turned on the light to see what it was and was surprised to see a live maggot on my bed i spent the rest of the night on the sofa i put the maggot in a glass and presented it to reception on leaving and asked whether i might be able to get a refund i was offered an upgrade of my breakfast from normal to continental i replied that there was no way in the world i would be eating in the hotel no manager was available to speak to me
