the bathroom it was a sss bathroom no proper separate shower toilet sink and shower all in one room there was a constant strange odor in the bathroom that made it unpleasant the room had too much furniture and it was a tight squeeze the couch was right in the walkway entrance to the room so you had to shuffle around it to get to the bed very strange layout
