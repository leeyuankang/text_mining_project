we didn t like the fact that we were not allowed to open the window at all and air conditioning was not working properly also bathroom was not cleaned properly there was a lot of dust on a dryer also during our stay the light didn t work so it was pretty much dark most of the time another thing is the shower door i couldn t open the door from the inside without my partner open it for me from the outside it was stucked it was also very hard to flush the toilet we had to push so hard the security deposit box was broken overally it was good but fixing these small problems would really make the stay much better
