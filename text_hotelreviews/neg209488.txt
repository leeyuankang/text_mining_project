i booked as a genius member and one of the perks was welcome drinks staff were rude and said that because they have a lot of genius members they don t do them i d also emailed to give a heads up we were celebrating a birthday and got no reply in the end we got welcome drinks and the manager was great gifting us a bottle of champagne the reception staff however were unhelpful and rude and i had a few run ins with them during my stay
