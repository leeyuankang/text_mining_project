i booked king size room but the room was ridiculously small not sure it even reached required standards as not enough room to walk around the bed less than inches between end of bed and wall too expensive for what it was very disappointing if staying here go for cheapest room possible having stayed in standard room before the room i had then was bigger than the king size and much cheaper unable to check in early
