the rooms are placed like a maze you go up then down on stairs and no elevator down so you carry your luggage the toilet seat too close to the towel rail heated rail that you can burn yourself sink in the bathroom fit in a very narrow way that there is no place to rest the soap phone was not working on saturday afternoon reception told me no maintenance to replace your phone checked out on monday and still phone not working so you can imagine i had to keep going through the maze back and forth to order food staff is nice but definitely management is absent
