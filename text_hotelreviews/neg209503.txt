unbelievably bad experience we did not receive a complimentary genius drink upon arrival during booking at check in and on the last night of our stay we requested a late checkout and were assured it was possible on the day of checkout at the agreed upon time we returned to the hotel to find the hotel staff had finished packing our bags and removed them from our room claiming the night shift failed to relay the message i have never been more angry at a hotel i could understand if they disregarded a single request but i made the same request on separate occasions and this is inexcusable so while the accommodations may have been acceptable i wouldn t keep any of the front office staff under my employ and i can t recommend this hotel in good conscience
