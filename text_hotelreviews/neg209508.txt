fired eggs were a bit greasy and bacon was more the american rasher type thin oily and not great so a bit of a disappointing cooked breakfast i would have expected better in the uk from an actual cafe i knew room i d chosen was basement with no window so not bothered too much apart from alarm clock was an hour behind and fire alarm went off due to apparently from someone taking a shower so was rudely awakened and a bit of a maze and worry getting out since no window in room but got free breakfast
