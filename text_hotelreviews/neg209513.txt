i have stayed in executive suite and it wasn t what i have seen on photos shower was not separated from the rest of the bathroom so i could sit on the toilet whilst showering also once you take the shower you cannot enter the bathroom because the floor is covered in water so you either have to mop the floor after you shower or have constantly wet feet i have asked for a different room but apparently they were fully booked and i was offered a smelly room without a window in a basement
