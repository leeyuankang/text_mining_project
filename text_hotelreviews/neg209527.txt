the room was extremely small with the bed having approx one foot of space between it and the window and one and half feet between the foot of the bed and the wall making access extremely difficult the interior window was stuck on with masking tape the pillows were hard the noise from the water pipes was very loud and was intermittent throughout the night as people used their bathrooms nearby
