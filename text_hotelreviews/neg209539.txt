we have stayed before at the property as the location is good however this time we were met at the reception desk by a very robotic receptionist whose english was not her first language no warmth or greeting just a list of the facilities including the fact that i had already been pre charged for the stay usually i am asked whether i would like to pay immediately or after the stay i asked whether we could have a complimentary drink as is usual at the said hotel for genius bookers a heated consultation with the other three receptionists ensued before we were told that this was not an option unless we joined the best western hotel users club then we could have a complimentary drink by this time we were feeling annoyed and irritated by the receptionists attitude and lack of interpersonal skills so we just went to our rooms
