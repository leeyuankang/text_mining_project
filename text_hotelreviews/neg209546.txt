when i went to check out there was a fire alarm malfunction which knocked out the computers the sole girl on reception did not have the password for the system no response to her phone calls for help fortunately another staff member came in to work and helped this was so there should have been more than one receptionist available for checking out i had to ask them to call me a taxi on their account as i was now going to be late for my meeting which i had planned to walk to when the taxi came he asked me whether i liked the hotel when i told him of my experience he told me that this happened frequently there and he often picked up unhappy guests who had requested a transfer plus my shower was lukewarm there was no loo brush in the bathroom and the coffee was lukewarm too a very poor experience very disappointing
