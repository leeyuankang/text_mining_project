on opening the door to our room we were greeted with an overpowering smell of damp mouldy stench we opened the window to try and reduce this as the hotel is on a main london street the traffic outside was relentless and after half an hour sitting with the window open and the constant noise we realised that the stench was not going to go we went down to reception to ask if we could be moved to another room and were told that all rooms were fully booked but front of house would try to resolve something for us we went back to the room and sat in our coats with the windows open for another hour waiting to hear from reception but heard noting we thought we would have a hot drink whilst waiting this is when we discovered that one cup was clean and one cup has sugary residue in the bottom obviously it had been used and put back then had not been washed by house keeping staff when preparing the room time to turn the kettle on this is when i turned on the socket to the kettle and my arm very slightly brushed the bedside wall light this was extremely loose and swung upside down obviously the cleaning staff must have known about this why wasn t if fixed before a customer had been put into that room i phoned reception to ask what they were actually doing and did not receive any productive input in fact they gave the feeling they had forgotten about us i had to suggest that if we could not be moved could someone at least come to the room with air fresheners and try to ascertain where the smell was coming from as up to then we had made one visit to reception two phone calls and yet not one member of staff had bothered to even view the problems with the room eventually a member of staff turned up with one timed battery air freshener and a can of spray air freshener they agreed the room smell was putrid and overpowering and she was also shown the very loose bedside lamp
