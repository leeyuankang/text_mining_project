on check in being a genuis customer i rang before hand to ask about free earlier check in when arrived this wasnt the case they didn t let me and the first lady on reception wasnt the most helpful apart from that the receptionist staff were pleasant silly to charge the security when there is no mini bar in rooms anyway and it takes days to be refunded this needs to be looked at
