will be making a complaint water came through the bathroom light the solution was to wipe it up with tissue and because it stopped dripping that was the leak fixed as a gas engineer i was shocked at the lack of investigation to find the source the panel above the bathroom didnt get moved to see where it was coming from both staffs english very poor and didnt understand what i was saying i over heard ot happened the previous day and also the room next door had the same problem so obviously lack of experience in this field to fix basic plumbing also had a funny smell in the hall and bedroom
