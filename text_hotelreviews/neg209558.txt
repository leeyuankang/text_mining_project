i arrived at the hotel at and was told that i couldn t check in until the woman at the check in desk held firm even when i reminded her that was only away so i had to wait i got to the room to find that birds had built a nest in a vent in the wall evident from the amount of noise so i had to ask maintenance to come and clear the nest away they weren t surprised when i told them so this was clearly an ongoing issue the birds were already back in the vent again the next morning i had a shower in the morning and stepped out of the cubicle to find water pouring through the bathroom fan in the ceiling which luckily wasn t on otherwise it could have been extremely dangerous the water had soaked the bathroom and all the towels which i then tried to dry myself with before ringing reception again to sort out this problem all of these things happened within so it didn t provide the best experience particularly taking into account the hotel price
