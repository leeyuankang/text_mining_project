no windows in many rooms or at least cannot open those too warm in the room no oxigen could not sleep well even furnitures are great and clean and comfortable my biggest problem was that cannot make any breeze in your room as only air condition system running which is not easy to setup as first time offered a room without window in the basement try was a room with window but to small max no possible to stay here even for person no place for your stuff so the room was capable related to size comfort but again no window so no fresh air
