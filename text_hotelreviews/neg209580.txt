hotel rooms were not complete and bathroom areas very small first room we had the shower was broken and there was no hot water we were moved into a second room which included broken air con and tv we were then moved into a third room on our last night which was sufficient whole stay was completely inconvenient we wasted soo much of our time complaining about the rooms and waiting for staff to do something about it terrible dissapointing experience
