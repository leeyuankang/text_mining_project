the staff didn t speak very good english or understand me we were greeted by a man fixing the air conditioning when we very first opened the door into our room we were told by the man fixing the unit that it was unsafe to stay in the rooms would not stay here again very disappointed as the hotel has a lot of potential of being a whole lot better
