firstly hotel is trying to manipulate the room spec they offer standard room w o window as a cheapest option but even if you choose executive room with king size bed you will learn that it can be blind room so small that you cannot fully open doors to bathroom cause they are blocked by the bed room for example extra night is fee for king size bed as i learned from receptionist rotfl as it occurred there are executive and executive rooms the true executive rooms are with window fridge and decent in size the other executive rooms have no window no fridge and are so small you cannot even enter bathroom no clue in what way they are assigned to guests secondly heating in the rooms is not working and requires strong argue to make it operating after several trials central a c started to operate however due to broken temperature sensors it was switching on and off constantly with no possibility to heat the room decently thirdly there was no possibility to take shower without flooding all bathroom as doors to the shower didn t close fourthly rooms were generally dirty windows in rooms could be opened as they are nailed to the wall room and i suppose they were cleaned last time when queen victoria was ruling the uk in bathrooms you can find variety of life forms between tiles on walls and floor inside the sink in the shower hotel offers black cups for do it yourself tea would be nice if they are washed when doing rooms in each of rooms we were the cups were dirty after the night before guests we washed them but let s not play the game it was an ugh experience finally the card i used for booking com reservation has been charged for the stay without my acceptance on checkout it occurred payment was already done by night watch to speed up checkout
