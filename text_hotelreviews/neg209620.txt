the given room was more like a renovated storage room it was a corner room with a weird layout and we needed to walk two steps up from the corridor room bed two beds are placed one feet apart from each other with one bed located just a feet away from the window because of the jogged wall at the end of the bed that one feet from the window is blocked by the bed with that few steps up going to the room and the duct for air conditioning the ceiling is very low we do not feel comfortable a sofa bed is placed three feet in front of the closet we do not understand the purpose of it we did not request for a sofa bed given that the room is already very cozy that is why we felt like it is a storage room more than anything area safety a random fake tourist asked for direction and two fake policemen came to ask for our passport just a block away from the hotel we said no and walked away we have heard this kind of scam for tourists at other countries before we also heard frequent police sirens around the area after eight we just feel unsafe we thought that we were in some bad areas in nyc or chicago breakfast the waitress did not replace the tea cup plate and spoon after use and she wiped them with the cloth which was just used to clean the table we were eye rolling
