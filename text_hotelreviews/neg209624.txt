check in was slow they had lost our paperwork used wine glass lying in the corridor at room was extremely small had to climb over one bed to get to the other and climb over both beds to get to the window lots of scuff marks on the walls in the room the housekeeper barged into the room in the morning without knocking whilst i was using the toilet he got a full eye full mumbled an apology and went out again this is despite a dnd sign on the door and some obviously useless high tech light system they have for each room showing if the occupants are sleeping or require a service very noisy from surrounding rooms and in corridor not noisy guests but you could here every footstep door close and conversations going on no need for an alarm clock because everybody wakes up when the first person in the hotel wakes up and walks across the room
