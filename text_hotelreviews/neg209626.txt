having to pay a deposit this is the first time i have ever had to do this why the key card for the door didn t work and took more new cards before i could get into my room after the machine terminal had to be fixed good thing i wasn t in a rush noise every time someone used the toilet or took a shower you could eat the water from it in the room and it was quite loud dusty cups and kettle they were covered in dust and fluff as if they had not been used in weeks the rest of the room was clean
