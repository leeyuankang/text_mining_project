the whole experience in this hotel was horrendous not one single english speaking person at all what bar person doesn t understand the word coca cola what manager of a hotel doesn t understand when you ask for a pint of peroni and thinks your asking for a cake menu was rubbish not even bacon on the breakfast menu its all catered for other nationalities lighting in the rooms is shocking we stayed in the executive suite and not a window in there at all its right next to the cleaning cupboard where the cleaners think its ok to be banging doors at in the morning the area this place is in is a run down high street with none stop traffic and police sirens constantly its suppose to be in camden when its no where near camden you have to catch a bus to get to camden which is a half hour ride away no way could you go out here at night the area is too intimidating
