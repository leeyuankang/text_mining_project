i have a gluten free diet and emailed beforehand but on arrival there was no gf food after a struggle to get the staff to understand what gf diet is they did kindly go to a local store and get some gf bread however nothing more was available for breakfast also the bar closed at which we felt was a little early with no way of getting a drink plus outside chairs tables were taken in at as a smoker too there was nowhere to sit outside after this time
