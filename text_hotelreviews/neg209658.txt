the food was disgusting and came to the table with foreign objects included personal to whoever cooked it which put everyone off their food staff did not understand english which made communication very difficult ordering a taxi took minutes to convince reception that we did not want to go to the airport we want to go to the theater overall very bad experience will never stay there again
