room had no window bit closed in feeling one member of staff tried to be friendly but she was the only one the other staff couldn t so much as manage a smile didn t like being asked for a cash deposit which i hadn t been made aware of before stay felt rather put on the spot room was clean and well presented although felt like we had been stuck in a broom cupboard especially as had to walk through hotel storage area to get to the room poor internet only one of us could use connection at a time the position of tv meant could only be viewed from one of the beds although in view of fact we couldn t actually receive a picture due to being in the basement this wasn t a problem
