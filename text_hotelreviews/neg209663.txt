i was given a floor room which was reached via floor by elevator then floors down the basement acessible only by various staircases such as in a labyrnt it was very difficult to reach the room by a suitcase also the room was very very clostrophobic during the stay i was terrified with a thought of fire and not being able to reach outside i dont know how the hotel got any fire licence at all
