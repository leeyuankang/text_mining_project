another case of a let down in london this hotel does in my eyes not qualify for stars the lift was broken for days i was on the top floor which shows little care for customer experience the housekeeping was at best basic and rubbish was left on the floor for the nights i stayed bed comfort is basic and only small pillows are provided under the sheets i found several pubic hairs there is no hairdryer or iron for clothing the reception was left unattended at night at several occasions which is a security issue as anyone can walk in i also called for a wake up call without anyone answering for at least minutes so this is not an occasional fault the walls are thin and housekeeping make no effort in keeping their business quiet i would pay tops per night for this property
