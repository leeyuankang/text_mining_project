the main issue for me was cleanliness and this led to me complaining in the end however in addition there was no hot water on my first night or the next morning so it was not possible to shower no information was provided either i had to ask reception who said there had been a problem with the boiler no apology or compensation etc the fridge was not working was dirty and when i investigated the plug found the socket hanging from the wall the window couldn t be opened which made the room claustrophobic despite the air con however the final straw was on the last night when i got in bed i noticed there seemed to be a plastic based sheet under the main bedsheet it didn t seem to fit properly and so i investigated and found an under sheet made of plastic towelling top this was badly stained had hair on it and was filthy i took this off and remade the bed at the same time pm a fire alarm also went off it did stop after a minute or so but i was concerned and rang reception however the line was dead and i had to ring from my mobile to get through everything was fine but this was another thing not working also one of the bedside lights i told the receptionist re sheet the next morning and asked a manager to go and look at it before the room was made up i asked that i have a response from the manager when i picked my case up however there was no message for me and as there was a different receptionist i decided to email my complaint so far i have had no reply so pretty poor and i would not recommend this hotel which charged me per night i did not eat there so can t comment on food etc
