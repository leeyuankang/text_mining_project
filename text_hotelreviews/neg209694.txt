oh lordy where to start we booked in to be told we were in a basement room fine no problems here we are semi normal year old healthy women i walk into the pitch black room in search of the light switch key activation to disappear down yes bloody steps thank god i love cake because i survived unhurt due to my padding the air con was useless which turned the room into a sweaty crypt trust me when your my age you need make up and water to stay in your body to look ok hence why i spent the trip looking like a dishevelled old dehydrated lady the stairs and under them doubles as a cleaning store cupboard and smelt like an old ladies crutch now i am with kids i stay in a hotel the key thing for me is sleep the fact every time someone else above us flushed the loo we were transported us into what life as a waterfall fairy would be was fun the first time not so much after that the fact that from every day the cleaning people started what u can only describe as a team relay up and down the stairs was exciting just mean they should be in rio one of those buggers is really quick the staff were lovely unable to move us or help but lovely to look at fine hotel just don t accept the crypt rooms you may not survive falls dehydration and lack of sleep will get you
