room was very nice but in the restaurant i ordered an medium rare steak that can only be described as more like flat chewy cheap bit of meat and on several occasions asked for ketchup and never received it tells you everything you need to know about the staff at the attached restaurant who would rather chat amongst themselves or one of their mates who was sat at the bar wouldn t recommend eating there to anyone
