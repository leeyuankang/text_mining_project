unfortunately the one thing that stands out for us is when my wife fell on the staircase on the first floor there is an unexpected step right on the landing as you move along the first floor landing i am describing this in detail in case it might help others to avoid the problem my wife fell quite badly injuring wrists knee and ankle fortunately she could still walk though with difficulty i think the unexpected step on the first floor landing should be sorted out in some way signeage or putting in a sloping gradient but what was very disappointing is that when this was all reported to reception there was no action no information no sympathy or concern nothing was recorded at the hotel even just some information about nearby medical facilities would have been some help as a result we spent the morning searching for medical assistance eventually ending up getting a bus to an urgent care centre in white city there my wife had x rays and very good treatment unfortunately this has coloured our view of the hotel measures should be taken to warn people about the step and those on reception should be trained to respond properly to accidents
