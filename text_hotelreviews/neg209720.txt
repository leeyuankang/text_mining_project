internal room beautiful room spotless bed was so comfortable and shower was so powerful air con was much needed but the whole idea of a room so far into a building with no natural light is just awful for me never again i know we got a good deal for prices in london but not worth it to feel so claustrophobic so i would go back but never to an internal room
