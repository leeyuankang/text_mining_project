the rooms are very small too warm we needed the disabled room room the room was not accessible for a wheelchair user there is only at either size of the bed to get in or out the mattress was smaller than the bed base which bruised the backs of my legs there was no window in the room and the air in the room was stuffy in the bathroom it was a full fitted wet room for my needs but the sink was very small it didn t empty very well it took ages to get a wash back to the bedroom there was no mirror at the dressing table bearing in mind disabled people need to sit to do their hair and make up the mirror was in front of the bed no where near the dressing table we did complain about the room and all of above they promised a free cooked breakfast the next morning which we didn t expect we ordered it and waited over mins for it the breakfast room wasn t busy when we questioned where it was it hadn t even been started so we left and went into town as our day was being wasted i won t be booking it again
