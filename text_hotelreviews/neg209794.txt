the room was only just slightly bigger than the double bed so no room to move at all worst of all though the plug socket was broken and i got electrocuted while i was trying to plug in phone charger when i complained to reception they said absolutely nothing and the manager wasn t around to speak to i have been waiting almost a week now for them to call me as every time i call them the manager is not available they are lucky it wasn t a child or someone with existing health problems who touch plug socket or this could have been a lot more serious
