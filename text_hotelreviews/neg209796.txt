asked for id passport driving licence etc has never happened to me before in a uk hotel britain abandoned the national identity card scheme many years ago and there is no obligation for a british citizen to carry id and i don t usually carry my passport with me if it is hotel policy that you have to provide id then this should be stated on your booking pages incidentally the best western in bournemouth never asked so i am somewhat dubious this is the case
