my room was exceptionally small so small my shins hit the end of the wooden bed frame when i walked in the room i would go so far as to say they have squished a double bed into a box room no space at all to manoeuvre around the room and that was with one side of the bed shoved up against the wall also no mirror in the bedroom there was a huge mirror in the bathroom but not much use when wanting to dry my hair of check i was presentable there was a small window that doesn t open outside of which was clearly home to the pigeons rudely awoken by the cooing at wasn t great
