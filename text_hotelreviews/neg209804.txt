first of all i was given a small room with no air conditioning remote control a tv remote control or a telephone i used my mobile phone to call down and ask for these things plus an iron and after minutes i decided to get dressed and head to reception were i was told the guy i spoke to had forgot about my call i eventually got the above items ironed my shirt and was heading out when i switched off the iron which caused the socket to blow sparks and the room electrics to trip out another call to reception and they decided to move me into another room the next night whilst sat on my bed doing some work on my laptop one of the reception staff decided to open my door and show in an old couple who appeared to be shocked by the sight of me in my underpants no apology just everyone turning around and walking out again not a good experience and not one word of apology for any of it suggests the staff are used to this kind of stuff
