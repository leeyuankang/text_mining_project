the room was supposed to be a king size but you could not walk around the bed there wasn t even enough room to open the bathroom door as it hit the bed there was no natural light in the room and it was difficult to negotiate the maze of narrow corridors and stairs with your luggage we had to change room at first as there was a strange smell in the room the location of the hotel is good and the area around the hotel has everything you need
