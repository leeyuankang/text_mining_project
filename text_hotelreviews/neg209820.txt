the main issue was that some kind of plumbing water pressure issue caused terrible noise through the night meaning very poor night sleep i was given a new room next night but the same problem existed in fact it was worse nothing was offered to me as an apology recompense first room was in a basement with no window and was tiny breakfast was pretty poor too
