despite all the positive reviews we had problem with cleanness of our rooms our first room wasn t cleaned up after the previous guests and we found items like bottles food wraps food socks etc all around the room with enough hair in the bed to make a wig after complaining at the reception we were given different room however the second room didn t have windows and was adjusted for disabled persons which was a little uncomfortable moreover cleanness was an isue here as well dirty floors dust everywhere my girlfriend is allergic to dust and the wash basin was cloged we reported this the very next morning and the receptionist assured us it would be taken care of except it wasn t i felt very uncomfortable in this hotel and cannot recomend it to anybody
