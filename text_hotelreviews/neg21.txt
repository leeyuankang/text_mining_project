our room was an overrated disaster room dirty smelly hot and very noisy of the banging doors in the corridor and from the other rooms we moved the couch a bid and the dirt and dust of months no cleaning appeared the smell of the gutter was very disturbing the lighting was too weak and a black bathroom is the worst design disaster one can imagine we found the whole hotel dirty dusty and dated to spend more then euros for a dirty attic room is daylight robbery
