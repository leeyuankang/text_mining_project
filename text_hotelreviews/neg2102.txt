on arrival at paddington hotel we were told that there was no hot water and that we were being transferred to another sister hotel the hotel was the same and was a nice hotel however as we had chosen the hotel due to its close location for all our planned activities being transferred to earls court south kensington was very inconvienient and distrupted our plans to the point that we were unable to make several visits that we had planned as we were unable to walk to the locations we had booked and had to spend extra monies and time using the tube taxis we received a voice mail from the hotel in the morning advising us of this fact but as we had already left for london we did not receive it
