the room was not prepared for the expected number of guests in fact we were expecting a people room but were allocated to a double room with additional folded up bed there was no towels or toiletries for three and glasses and cups were not in the room in general not much space for three people and lack of attention to the detail and guests comfort we needed to ask for a steam room and sauna to be turned on after finding out that they were completely cold when we turned up to use them we needed to ask for dressing gowns and slippers as they were nowhere to be seen
