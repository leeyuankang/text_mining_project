it became difficult to check in when wanting to pay for my room in cash i paid for one night for a superior premium room with queen bed and sofa bed when we arrived the room wasn t like the photos that are advertised for that specific style room and we had no remote for the tv our sofa was made up into another double bed so had to put it back into a sofa so we could relax on the sofa and once asked about more tea coffee facilities the receptionist said it wasn t there issue that s for the house keepers job so will have to wait till morning plus the fire alarm went off at once rushing to get dressed and outside the hotel to be told false alarm and should go back to our room not very good at all the breakfast was included in our price but there wasn t much food left when we arrived at quiet a lot needed re filling up over all quiet a disappointing result
