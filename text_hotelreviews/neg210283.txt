at am we were woken up with a male staff coming into our room with his key he was obviously the cleaner i managed to get up and alert him we were in the room he apologised and went i complained to the staff on check out but they just said that the staff have no way of knowing whether people have checked out of their rooms or not unbelievable in this day age with all the technology anyway it s no excuse as check out is not until noon so they should have checked then we hadn t got to bed until from our night out so when he appeared he woke us all up and that was it we were awake angry to say the least when i complained the staff offered us a free drink in the bar i refused as we were on our way into london and a free drink does not make up for the lack of sleep what was turning out a great stay ended up as a disaster
