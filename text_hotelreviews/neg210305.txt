the way the staff behaviour in this hotel was disgusting and will never visit here again we paid exactly the same as other paying guests but because me and my friend weren t dressed in a suit the hotel staff totally ignored us this was just the first of a bad experience the first morning we sat down for breakfast and the staff immediately told us to move so that a table could be made for a family which requested a table made for i m not sure why the family was better than us but this is the way the hotel staff made us feel working in a high end retailer i train my staff on not to judge customers and this is what this hotel did
