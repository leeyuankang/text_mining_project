staff in restaurant needs a lot of training on customer service we went to restaurant at and we were informed that we cannot sit in restaurant that should be open until as we are too late as a solution they sat us at the bar which would not be a problem if we would not hear the constant noise of setting up the whole bar for breakfast at on saturday night except one gentelman in the bar i think he was from romania no one paid attention to us we were the only customers eating and the waitress made us feel like she wanted to get rid of us as soon as possible our main courses were served together with desserts so you can image our face when we received icream with burgers the same time the excuse was that restaurant is closed it was only so it took them min to prepare it they completely missed the fact you could order iceream so i m not sure why they could not wait until we finish our mains food was poor quality too probably rushed to be prepared so staff can go home the whole experience was horrible and we did not go to breakfast because of that hotel is lovely but now we know the reason why your restaurant is empty on saturday night we were laughing next day that you can get more friendly service at mcdonalds than at hotel restaurant in addition please review this comments as opportunity for improvement i am not a needy customer in fact i used to work as assistant manager in one of uks novetels during my studies and from what i remember it was a high standard restaurant it s a shame this is not the case anymore
