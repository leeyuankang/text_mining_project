this is a really insignificant comment i m going to have to dig deep to complain but here it goes the wall between the bathroom and bedroom is glass half of which is frosted there is no door on the wc so privacy is an issue however on our second night we learned that the small button next to the bath cleverly turned the unfrosted part of the glass wall frosted making the bathroom completely private my complaint we had to find this out for ourselves a note explaining the operation of the button would have helped so there you go that explains what we did t like if that is your only complaint you re going to enjoy a great stay at this hotel
