i booked a superior room and requested single beds for a specific reason and spoke to booking com and the actual hotel to confirm this on arrival there was a double bed in the room and we were told they did not have any single beds in the hotel at all the room had a put u up bed which was very narrow and hard and was totally unsuitable for my husband or myself eventually we were offered a larger room with a larger double bed which we felt we had to accept as we didn t know much about other hotels nearby i felt very badly let down by both the hotel and the people at booking com that i had spoken too prior to booking
