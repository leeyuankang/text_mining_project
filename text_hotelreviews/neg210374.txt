i had another hotel cancel my booking on the day so had to find another at late notice in the area this was best available at probably more than it is actually worth at i don t expect a rubbish sofa bed for the guest but that is what i got room the bed is leaning to the right i had to shuffle back in on plenty of occasions to not fall out
