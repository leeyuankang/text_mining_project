the layout of the ground floor of the hotel was not very welcoming at all people having afternoon tea in the main area ie the street avenue completely inappropriate along with those people who are accessing the chinese restaurant attached to the hotel not great for guests inability as a guest to get a table at the bar or sit at a table due to protocol ie reserved for those eating due to the number of reserved tables
