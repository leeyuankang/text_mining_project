room was rather dingy and dark neglected looking was upgraded but original smaller room in better condition would after all have been preferable was not of usual excellent standard and i wondered if i had been palmed off with a lesser room because i was staying on my own think a male businessman must have been prior guests style of room was dull and businesslike and same for magazines in room and was not adapted for one occupant with dreasing gowns no slippers or hairdryer had to ask for them have stayed at dorchester with others quite a few times including xmases and was looking forward to this treat so was disappointed with respect to the room
