so old the food quality is not that good it feels like a stars hotel plus the facility is not that advanced and the tv was on the corner of the room which is very far a way from the bed or the sofa you have to turn off your head to watch it the water pressure of the shower box and the bathtub was very low i got an apology from the manager but seriously i don t think is enough cause i really paid for a special stranded and it was so below my expectation
