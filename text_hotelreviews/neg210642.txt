i was really looking forward to breakfast at this hotel as this is my favourite meal of the day the breakfast was awful the omelette was over cooked even though we asked for it medium done the sausages were hard and rubbery and there was not a good selection of bread just cheap toast was offered for a hotel of that calibre you would think that the breakfast would be first class i stayed at the corinthia in the summer and the breakfast there was outstanding i was extremely disappointed with the breakfast at this hotel very sub standard considering it s a five star hotel and the very high rates they charge
