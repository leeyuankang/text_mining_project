all the restaurants were overbooked and only availability for christmas lunch for example was at the gym is really small and old fashioned and not in keeping with a top quality hotel i have stayed at the dorchester many times before and was most surprised to discover a really pungent smell of take out curry permeating the whole of the fourth floor this however was not the case on the floor below but rather unpleasant and disappointing
