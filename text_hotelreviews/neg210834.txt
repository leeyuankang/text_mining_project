there was a problem with the plug in the bath which stuck so you couldn t empty it most days as a result water leaked and made the carpet wet outside bathroom door i think that this problem must occur regularly and needs a permanent solution rather than calling an engineer plumber out very day someone came quickly every time but would be much better if it didn t happen
