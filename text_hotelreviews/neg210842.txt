the mattress was so uncomfortable and caused a very sore back and tiredness which was not at all helpful for the business we were there for over the days stay you should take a look at the the premier inn as i would rate their beds as being total comfort and better than what we experienced at the hilton and we were not the only ones with the same view point at breakfast this spoil t the hilton experience for us and other guests we spoke to
