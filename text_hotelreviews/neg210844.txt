the rate in euros calculated by bookings was for two nights it turned out that the hotel does not accept normal banking cards type maestro nor does it accept a payment upon your departure of course i was not informed about the payment limitation so i had to take out pounds that it was equivalent to euros the hotel declined any responsibility as the reservation was made via bookings i will not return to this hotel again as i find this outrageous for a star hotel
