i asked times different people for a sheet on my bed all told me that they would put a sheet on the bed i hate not having a sheet on the bed the duvet is too heavy and makes me too hot finally my wife had to go the next day to the front desk to complain since we did not get a sheet the previous day and ask again for a sheet finally a housekeeper showed up that could not speak english and asked what we wanted and when we told her she proceeded to take the cover of the duvet after pointing and trying to communicate in english we finally got her to go and bring us back a couple of sheets she still did not understand and simply just handed me the sheets expecting me to make the bed please consider your bedding options and provide at least one sheet not just a duvet the ac does not go below so if a person is hot no ac no sheet very uncomfortable
