my room was on the first floor not served by lift and we had to go up by twelve stairs when i made the reservation i said lifts were required as my wife has dificulties to go up and down trough stairs when i claimed the receptionist told me to change the room was available but as we had already used the room and emptied the bags so we decided to remain there
