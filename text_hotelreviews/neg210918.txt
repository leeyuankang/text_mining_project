firstly no attention was paid to our very advanced booking requesting a higher external room they put us in an internal room next to the lift and only after complaining did they change our room secondly they claimed that they didn t receive request through booking com and yet would only book a second night through your site make any sense it leaves the impression of being a very impersonally run hotel where money counts more than customer satisfaction
