the bed was an old bed and very uncomfortable each time i turn the bed would make noise i was really surprise for such a top name hotel to have such uncomfortable bed i would expect that from hotels like travel lodge i was really disappointed and felt like the pounds newly that i paid for the two nights was money down the drain although the cleanliness is excellent the carpets too could do with a facelift
