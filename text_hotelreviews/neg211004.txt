bed very hard and not that comfortable and creaked a lot also you advertise bottle of wine yet only one small red on arrival not a half bottle this would have been small bottles also did not state this was only for one night as part of the executive package also you should serve crisps ie light snack when serving alcohol rather than saying they can only be served at when the alcohol is served from this would be more in line with supporting responsible drinking
