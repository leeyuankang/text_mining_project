we were told at reception by the person who booked us in that to have room service for breakfast would cost for two people on going to book this in different receptionist we were then told it would cost about more she then went and got the original receptionist who decided that we could pay for breakfast because we were told several different things and also what they were saying was not what it said on the bottom of the breakfast door hanger on leaving another receptionist then charged us for having breakfast in our room this was very disappointing
