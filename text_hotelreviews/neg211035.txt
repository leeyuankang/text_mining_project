having spent initially on a king suite we were so dissapointed with the beds they were so uncomfortable our twi nights sleep were broken and not a good experience especially when u book a king suite although the staff gave us a discount i really don t feel like i ll be returning to a hilton again which is a shame as i have been a fan of ur brand for many years we definately didn t get value for money or feel like we have enjoyed the hilton brand that u are famed for
