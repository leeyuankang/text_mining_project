i had requested a late check out which i had received a confirmation email advising me that my booking had been updated upon leaving i was asked to pay as i had checked out late even though it was with within the time i had booked my late check out for the receptionist was quite rude and tried to argue the case and said i should have checked when checking in but did let us off the payment as i clearly had the email stating my late check out had been confirmed by the hotel
