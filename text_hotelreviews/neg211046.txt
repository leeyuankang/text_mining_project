booked executive suites and when we got to our rooms one was a suite and one had been downgraded to executive double we hadn t been informed by reception at check in so i thought i booked the wrong rooms i checked my booking and confirmed that i had booked the suites so went back down to reception to be told we had been downgraded due to a leak in the other suite no one called us to make us aware or give the option to cancel or refund and no one told us at check in we spoke with the manager who gave us an extra room and said he would look after us because it was a special occasion birthday nothing happened as far as this goes the executive lounge that we had acces to was dirty and felt inferior to the main communal areas
