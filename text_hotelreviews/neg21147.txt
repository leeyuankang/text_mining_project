hotel blocked on my card on top of the full price for room without any notification or information in booking com system which i find breaching booking com rules the amount was released days after check out which meant that during my london trip i couldn t spend part of my money receptionist manager in the hotel couldn t find any immediate solution to that and behaved as it hadn t been any issue is not about but i may simply imagine that the hotel might have blocked for same security reasons and in such condition i would be deprived of any money i had converted earlier to my gbp account before weekend trip it s just can t be trusted
