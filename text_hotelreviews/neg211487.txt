air conditioning in room made an odd noise throughout the night which disturbed my sleep the room safe was in the locked position and we weren t able to use it despite mentioning it during our stay we arrived ahead of check in and we re told we could leave our bags by reception and they would be taken to our room once it was ready when we returned someone else s bag was in our room and ours still by reception there were some cracked tiles in the bathroom and some mould in the shower whilst the shower was a bit temperamental it just felt as though it needed a bit of a spruce up we didn t have breakfast here preferring to eat out
