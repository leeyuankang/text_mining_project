i stayed here a few years ago when it had just opened you can definitely see it has aged a bit and could do with a fresh coat of paint here or there also the breakfast was a little basic the day we were there and certainly not as good as i remembered you need to know the lift only goes to the second floor out of four and that some rooms are in the quite somber basement
