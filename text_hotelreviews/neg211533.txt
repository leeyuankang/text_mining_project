they advertise free wifi but at check in i received a free wifi voucher which was valid for days only and we had booked and stayed nights they would have probably provided an extra voucher if i asked but it is a bit shortsighted on their part when booking we asked for a room above the street ground level but the room allocated to us was in fact on ground level and facing the back yard although this was a slight disappointment the silver lining was that the room had a private veranda with a bench and a table and my wife and i actually spent many quiet moments there reminiscing on the day s sights and activities in the time we spent there we had breakfast only once as we mostly ate on foot through out town i felt that the options and food selections are slightly scanty and minimalistic but this seems normal for most small hotels and establishments i did not leave hungry though the complimentary coffee and tea in our room were not replenished daily which is a bit of a surprise because the way i see it if lodgers change daily the staff would have to refill these for the new guests because of this and the wifi issue mentioned earlier and considering the price range of this hotel i could not help getting a tiny feeling of stinginess and parsimoniousness on part of the staff management but this is just a minor feeling perhaps not even worth writing about
