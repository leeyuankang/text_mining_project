i was worried by some of the electrics the wall lights on the bed headboard were wobbly and had some of the copper wire sticking out at the top one of the hairdryers crackled when i picked it up and i couldn t read when it was pat tested so i avoided that but i was wired into the wall so i think maybe it should be removed
