breakfast was disappointing it was obvious the hotel does not have the facilities to prepare food and this was definitely reflected in the breakfast there are other options nearby and that is what we did after the first morning if you have hefty suitcases make sure you do not have a room on the third or fourth floor because the lift does not go to these floors the staircase is narrow so lugging suitcases up the stairs is not a good option though the concierge offered to do this for us we swapped rooms instead
