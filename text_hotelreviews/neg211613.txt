no elevator to the third floor the receptionist at night on the was very impolite he told me that my room was in the third floor but the number was so i thought it was on the first floor so asked him again to make sure and he was very impolite shower is poor in order to adjust it you have to go through the water which can be cold or hot stairs are very dangerous they are narrow i cant believe they charge euros for this hotel
