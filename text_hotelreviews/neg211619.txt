the only thing that makes the hotel attractive is the surrounding area and this is how the hotel advertises itself putting pictures of the science museum yes obviously the hotel is cheaper than the alternatives around but you get a very small room and virtually there is no lobby or a place to hang around what i did not like was that mineral water was refilled only once during my five nights stay and that on the last day maids took used towels but forgot to put a new ones
