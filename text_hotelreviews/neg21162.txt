i ve talked to several people ola gabrielle salem about how dissatisfied and was never asked to be put in another room nor did they compensate me for the extreme discomfort i was in then i was told veronique delattre was going to be in contact and that was days ago my daughter had a room ella and the air cooling system was broke and we called times and finally they brought her a fan never was she asked to be put in another room or anything and our room air cooling system worked perfect however in our room there was a really bad smell coming out of the pipes that causes my fianc to buy several times and i mentioned downstairs and nobody ever sent anyone up or asked to put us in another room because my daughter s room didn t smell like that every time we had breakfast something was wrong and they had to bring something else up on the last day we ordered an express brekfast and the lady on the phone said she would have a grilled ham and cheese with a coffee when i go downstairs to pick it up gabrielle said they don t make grilled ham and cheese and the kitchen was closed and they don t make coffee now i stay in hotels every single week and i ve never heard in the history of staying anywhere that our kitchen is closed and we can t make you coffee if that was the case i would never tell a paying customer that we can t make a cup of coffee for you even if the kitchen was closed but what made matters worse was that they lady took our order down and it has cups of coffee my point is that the staff taking the order could have told us paying customer that which would not have made it right but at least it would have made us aware in the end we didn t eat the sandwich and the banana looked like they were both open and we didn t eat those finally salem in the end after much complaining and understanding where i was coming from he made us a coffee
