we had an executive room which was new and clean but it lacked a few things firstly no mirror at the vanity desk unit to do your hair so you had to stand near the bathroom to do this our room was no plug in sink so difficult for my partner to shave as some men still enjoy a wet shave overall good but missed those few things may seem petty but sometimes little things add up
