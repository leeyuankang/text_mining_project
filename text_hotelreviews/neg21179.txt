we had a new style room and the sink was in the bedroom looked ok but impractical to use no stopper so you cant get a sink full of water very limited on space for toiletries which tended to make it look a mess shower enclosure and toilet door are full length mirrors which quickly got covered in finger marks generally all design but not functional oh and a huge wall to wall picture over the bed of a fox in the snow err this is london not lapland breakfast was a bit of a rugby scrum with lots of people all trying to get food at same time hot buffet was ok but food was only tepid and one slot toaster for the entire dining room was a joke and it was really really slow
