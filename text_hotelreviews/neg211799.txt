nothing everything was perfect please be careful with the taxi drivers prices from gare du nord train station to the hotel should be euros and we got stung for when we arrived but the hotel staff told us what taxis to get and how much it should be from our hotel to roland garros no more than euros so if you go please ask first and don t be afraid to walk away
