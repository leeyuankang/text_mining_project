the room that the hotel gave us was very dark and was all the way to the back in the reception they sold the room as it was very good however it was very small and dark and claustrofobic but it always happen when we book through booking com the hotels prefer to give the better rooms to their own clients when it is booked through here they always give the worst rooms my experience in barcelona was the same praktik rambla hotel did the same thing
