room by the service elevator is very noisy up to midnight it was also very small correspondence by email was horrible kept calling me madam despite being corrected twice and never answered my questions the morning i left the front desk seemed annoyed when i asked for my car valet parking he pointed and said it s at the other hotel you can go get it but never gave me a name for the hotel i came back three times asked him where it was and finally in a huff he said look i will show you then and walked across the street to a hotel that had no name on the outside how the hell was i supposed to know that was a hotel also got a parking ticket as a result of their valet parking the hotel did pay it eventually overall i d look elsewhere but it will do in a pinch
