the room described by booking com as s superior double didn t meet my expectations i wouldn t want to stay in a normal double it was exceptionally cramped with poor quality fittings in the bedroom the hotel website makes no mention of such a room and in fact the room we had looks most like what it describes as a single room albeit with a double bed i feel a bit let down
