because there s no air conditioning it could get very warm sometimes they did provide you with a portable fan though which helped a little and although it s close to the tube station and the tower of london it s kinda far from everything else such as shops restaurants and supermarkets the bed was too soft and very lumpy so it was uncomfortable to sleep in right now early november the hotel is going through a renovation so it could get very loud and noisy during the day
