showers were not enclosed so we had baths instead to avoid flooding floor the small kitchen was not well enough equipped to cook for only x hotplates plus microwave no oven and very little prep space it would be fine if you are intending to eat out all the time the television only had bbcworld english speaking and cnn worse thing of all was the extreme levels of noise from outside at night the apartment is situated in an excellent central and charming area of paris but it is opposite a very popular restaurant which is open every night people congregate noisily outside well into the early hours and have no concept that other residents exist or are trying to sleep lots of shouting and loud laughter for hours the apartment has wonderful high windows looking onto the street but the glass and shutters don t provide any protection from the noise quality earplugs are a must saying this please remember that the apartment is situated infront of the hotel if you are booking a room in the hotel you should be ok because it is set right back away from the street and looks a really nice place to stay a classy mix of old and new
