one of the reason i chose this hotel was to use the jacuzzi i actually called few days before to book the time and i was told it would be ok because it was quiet however when i arrived it was broken down and i was not made aware of it we asked to use the hamam instead but when we went it was turned on at only c instead of so we had to leave before it reached the right temperature it is a shame considering we wanted to relax before jumping on a plane the next day the hotel could be easily regain its luxury status if management invest in updating some of the furniture in the rooms which have clearly aged it remains nevertheless a charming place
