the price that i was quoted online when i reserved the room was not the price that i was charged i was actually charged almost more than i was supposed to be this is quite annoying and frankly it is not good value for what you obtain for that price i would have booked a more up scale hotel small additional annoying issue the pillows are massive but impossible to sleep on since they are foam and do not give so after the first night i had to make my own pillow from a towel and sweaters the tea at breakfast was so weak it was horrible and the coffee tasted horrible also my bathroom door jammed shut and i could not use it one morning and had to leave and asked the hotel staff to repair it good thing i was not locked inside
