from the reviews i was expecting a haven but it didn t quite meet our expectations the room though large for london was a bit dated with no frills though it had a vey small modern shower room and toilet which unfortunately had a leak so we ended up with wet feet there were warning signs all over the walls i m all for health and safety but it made the room feel a little unwelcoming why install a slippery floor in the bathroom no tea making facilities but you could request complimentary tea and coffee in your room i particularly dislike having to request a cuppa so didn t bother this approach seems to be quite common with chains but very unusual for a boutique hotel our room was quite noisy and the curtains didn t close properly so it wasn t that peaceful overnight thankfully it was only for one night i am always hoping to find a little gem of a place i can return to when i m in the capital i m afraid i m still looking
