i have stayed in this hotel in the past and enjoyed it i was really disappointed this time as i asked for a high floor and got a basement room with one window facing a wall under the sidewalk i understand they ran out of availability but i would expect from such a level hotel to let me know if all they have is a basement room after i requested a high floor and this room is priced like all other rooms expensive worse was the insulting approach of the lady in the reception who was trying to convinced me that this is the best room in the hotel and the man in the reception the following morning when i checked out ask me how was my stay but when i explain my agony about my stay didn t really care to listen and just said sorry to hear
