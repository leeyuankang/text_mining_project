had a few problems during my stay a male member of staff scared the pants out of me trying to close my door at in the morning apparentely i left it open not so sure as doors close automatically without anouncing himself at all all i heard is my door rattled and opening so i thought the worse they apologised the next day and moved me to another room i was in the basement first which was scary anyway as i could see people from my bed walking past throught the gap in the window but no other concessions or compensation was offered for my distressed a whole night of no sleeping as i was petrified as i woman travelling on my own i need to feel safe where i stay and unfortunately i didn t breakfast room was very hot in the morning aircon was on but not sufficient new room given wasn t very good the aircon leaked from the roof onto the carpet all the time i think this was a recurrent issue as the carpet was higher in the part of the room from the start wifi was pretty bad as well would have also liked to have coffee tea facilities in the room rather than having to bother staff in the middle of the night if you fancied a brew
