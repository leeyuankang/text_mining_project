although polite the staff were somewhat distant and it felt like they were going through the motions and had no personal interest in us when we were leaving doors were not held open and there was no offer to help with getting a taxi the process for tea and coffee was explained you need to ask for it to be made and brought to you however the onus is on you to request and specify the drinks rather than for it to be offered which might make some people uncomfortable hot chocolate i think is charged our drinks came with one m s chocolate teacake each would have expected a plate of biscuits breakfast is a little disappointing there is a limited english breakfast selection already cooked and warmed bacon mushrooms baked beans and two types of cooked egg no toast although you might have to ask for it an interesting selection of fresh bread cheeses and cooked meats the pastries look like those from m s rather than freshly made from the artisan bakery round the corner
