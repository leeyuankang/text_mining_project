the plug for the hairdryer was nowhere near the mirror which made things extremely difficult the room was too hot through the night the bathroom looked luxurious but water dribbled out of the shower not the power shower i was expecting only enough milk etc for two drinks each wasn t the cheapest hotel so a bit disappointing
