room temperature was very warm and as with many london hotels difficult to regulate by opening a window due to the road noise this hotel is on a main road and the sirens from emergency services will interrupt sleep this is not the hotels fault clearly i had a deluxe room and my friends a standard other than size i couldn t see much difference one thing i didn t like was i had to show id on check in i stay in hotels across the uk and the world i understand passports are required by foreigners in different countries but not in ones own country and the lady on reception was not the friendliest the manager however was very friendly and helpful and made up for these difficencies
