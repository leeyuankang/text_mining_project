in the first room the a c didn t work so the room temperature was degrees which made for an uncomfortable night option to open the window but with the noise of the tube station outside meant it wasn t ideal plus with work taking place to the exterior of the building with scaffolding covering the entirety of the exterior there was no privacy or safety if the windows were open the staff moved us to a second room where the a c was still not working and just left the windows open the drain was blocked which meant water in the sink and shower just collected and drained extremely slowly overall all a terrible experience and poor customer service as no form of compensation was offered and no attempt was made by the staff to rectify the problem before the next guests
