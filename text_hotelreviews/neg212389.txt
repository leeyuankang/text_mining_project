over all a good experience for the price in london as i saw beforehand many complaints about noise i asked specifically for a quiet room at reception i asked if this was taken into consideration and i was assured it was it probably was the quietest room available but it was noisy nonetheless i slept with oropax and it was ok the bathroom was clean ok but the shower was not cleaned thoroughly also the bed had some stains as sheets were ok i did not bother but not very nice either
