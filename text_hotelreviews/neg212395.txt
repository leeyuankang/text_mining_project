we purchased a deluxe room it was unbelievably small floor space and head space slanted ceiling with random poles in the room windowless and not at all as represented in the pictures essentially a glorified cupboard in the attic it is noisy you can hear everything anyone says outside and the show outside of the tube entrance downstairs the door had a large gap at the button which meant the light from the corridor lit up the room all night bed was soft but again very small and we aren t that big people we asked for a replacement or a cancellation but the staff were fairly clueless and said we have to wait for the manager to get in on monday we only stayed night on saturday overall very disappointed as it was our anniversary and had i known how small and claustrophobic the room was i would have spent more to stay somewhere else
