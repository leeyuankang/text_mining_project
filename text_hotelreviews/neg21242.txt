breakfast was a shambles hot food items ran out and were not replaced quickly resulting in queues and frequent visits back to that area always had to ask for tea coffee no one kept an eye out for our needs also the bar on sunday night was very very noisy a raucous rowdy chanting party rendered it impossible to hold a conversation with family and friends there is nowhere else to go from there to get away from the row our daughter had run the london marathon and we had no intention of walking outside to find another bar our tooth mugs and milk cartons were not refreshed and we had no bath plug our pillows were mightily uncomfortable in whatever combination we tried it didn t seem like a four star hotel to us and though stunning in its styling and location it was disappointing in its service especially at breakfast chaotic
