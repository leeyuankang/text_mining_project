there isn t anything i dislike about but there are a couple of things to note there isn t a lift it s all stairs but only a few floors so that isn t a big deal but be aware if you are with someone who has limited mobility also outside is shepherd s bush station which is hugely convenient but noisy at night but again nothing a set of ear plugs won t cure
