stairs i stayed on the floor which was flights up please note this was not an issue for me at all just pointing out if you have a lot of luggage but i believe the porter is on hand to assist in this case main road is very busy especially on saturday night with bars across the road again please note this was not an issue for me i prefer a main road with lots of amneties and noise was not sigificant enough to disturb my sleep or stay but just wanted to point out to be fair for the location this is expected no way around being so central and avoiding some noise
