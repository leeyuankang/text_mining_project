check out was too early and the staff lady was very bad in calling and nocking on your door to ask me to leave even it was only very bad when i asked ok want to stay half day and leave they said no you need to pay full day rate i told them but it is an international standard that if you check out at you pay half day rate not full rate but they insisted and charged me full day rate even i checked out at this was very bad to be treated like that from the management
