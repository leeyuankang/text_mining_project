this is the forth time i have used this group of hotels and the time i have turned up and had the excuse of there is a problem with the boilers and you have been affected and we will have to relocate you i told them to stop using the same excuse when they overbook the hotel as it does not work for me they tried to convince me to go to south kensington hotel which is told rubbish i managed to get another room in the hotel just very poor attitude to use on customers
