work was being done in the hotel no mention of this work when i made the reservation when you enter the small reception area there is a very powerful odour of some sort of floral chemical it is terrible makes you wonder what kind of smell they are trying to disguise in the area it does not smell fresh and clean they kindly gave me a room early much appreciated the room was an upgrade two double beds very small the bathroom for four people would be very tight there are no hooks available to hang a toiletry bag very inconvenient the room overall was very dark no place to properly put make up on lighting over the beds for reading were well placed they provide instant coffee tea biscuits and water beds were on the soft side sheets clean and decent quality there is a safe in the closet a few blocks from paddington station quite a distance from the centre of things but the tube is close by and one can come and go as long as you don t mind tube travel and have the time this hotel would not be one to stay with children very small and cramped however for singles and couples it is very affordable and does provide a comfortable stay for the cost definitely worth a look if you are on a budget lots of good little restaurants to eat meals very close by one can walk from the station with your luggage to the hotel easily
