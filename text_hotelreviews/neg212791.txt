i felt the room was very small scene as though i thought id booked a deluxe double when we arrived we was made aware that the hotel did have building work going on which was fine room was ground floor room number i was awoken at on our last day by the sound of building work going on and at i opened my curtains to the sight of builders looking through the shed i don t mind being on the ground floor but i believe that this room should of been taken off the avaliable rooms during construction due to the fact i could not open my curtains the while time i was there as fear of builders appearing at any time not having the light from the open curtains was made worse by the fact the ceiling light kept turning its self on and off again
