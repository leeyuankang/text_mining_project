i knew my single room would be small but it felt even smaller because some of the furniture fixtures were to large for the room the bathroom had a very large sink basin which took up so much space in addition a smaller chair at the desk would have served the same purpose without taking up so much space there was a full sized ironing board in the closet which took up half of the closet space but the room was so small there was no where to set up the board if it was needed
