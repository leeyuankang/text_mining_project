didn t get to stay at the shaftesbury hotel they we doing renovations so was taken to the park grand hotel and was offered to have a complementary breakfast i was given a room in the basement comfortable bed but unless i drew the curtains i could watch peoples feet going past on the pavement and there were steps outside to the basement the sink in the en suite was difficult to wash in as my shoulders touched both the wall and the shower unit so you could not move no breakfast as left before to get to heathrow
