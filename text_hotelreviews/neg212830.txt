we were shown into a room with only a shower when i asked to have a room with a bath i was told that they didn t have one i felt quite put out as i particularly wanted to have a bath went back to the reception and told them that i wouldn t have booked there if the room didn t have a bathroom i saw the maids were still cleaning so i said we are going out to eat and when we get back i would like a room with a bath suddenly i was given a key to another room with a bath
