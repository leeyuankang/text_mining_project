i wasn t very happy with the staff at check out we checked out at as per our request at earlier in the morning and the person my partner spoke to did not mentions anything about any late check out charges to point out also when i checked in the night before i didn t get told what time check out was from anyway so we had to take up our resting time in the morning to call the reception and ask which was a bit inconvenient i would come in future as it was a lovely hotel close to central and the room was very cosy but in future the guys at reception should really ask their guests at check out if they enjoyed their stay and whether they would need a taxi taking them anywhere it s very basic customer service being a manager of a boutique hotel myself i know what to expect and i wasn t expecting such an unfriendly check out experience nonetheless we could come back in the future
