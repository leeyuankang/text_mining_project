i found bugs on my pillow that could have bitten me they didnt even give me free breakfast or an upgrade or anything they just moved me into another room on top of that i was taking a shower and then the water would not go from boiling hot to normal i had to call the reception and my hair and everything was wet and they had to come up and fix it for half an hour the staff was not even helpful when i had to move the rooms the person just helped us a little but it was is moving our things it was just horrible thank god we were out most of the time
