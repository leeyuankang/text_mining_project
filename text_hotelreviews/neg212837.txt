little effort done for housekeeping cups we used from the first day were not washed or replaced for the days we were there cleanliness is a little suspect so we bought and used our own cups bedsheets weren t changed windows weren t cleaned if you look under the bed it s horrendous worst part was check out was delayed half an hr as duty manager was asleep we checked out at am the trainee told us the duty manager is on break we could see him trying to call the duty manager for a good half an hour to no avail until we demanded that he returned us the deposit and allowed us to check out almost missed our train as a result
