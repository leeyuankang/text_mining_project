i opted for the super deluxe single choice and regret it the room did not match the photo i received on my booking sheet it was far too small and with my luggage i couldn t move the end of the bed was so close to the wall that i couldn t get my suitcase to the luggage rack i know rooms are small in london hotels but there is better value and larger rooms in other hotels nearby i know i stayed at one on my trip
