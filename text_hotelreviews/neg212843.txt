the corridors were a bit dark as this is an older building so perhaps brighter light bulbs would help yes the floors are creaky but that is to be expected with older buildings the bathroom towels could be bigger and the pillows could be a bit softer but i am sure if we had contacted housekeeping they would have been happy to bring us a feather pillow all in all more positives than negatives and the negatives did not deter from the enjoyment of our stay
