room was tiny to the extreme small double against wall top and bottom and inches from wall window on one side you can t get out without other person getting out or climbing over room on lower floor so could hear aircon unit outside all night hallway noisy in morning think it was near breakfast area i stayed one night and went out for evening so coziness wasn t an issue for me but for some it will be especially if staying longer even with a single bed in it this room would be tiny
