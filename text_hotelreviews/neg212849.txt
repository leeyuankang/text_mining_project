the room i was in was small i work on cruise ships so small rooms don t bother me but they may bother others if you like to have room to move don t get the single bed rooms i also found the hotel quite noisy the window in my room wasn t double glazed so i got lots of traffic noise and some noise in the guest corridors if you re a light sleeper i wouldn t recommend
