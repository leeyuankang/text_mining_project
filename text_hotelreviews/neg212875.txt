room was very small but clean fine for a night stay mattress on the bed needs replaced was very soft window needs replaced as well not double glazed the frame had seen better days could feel a draught coming in i actually moved the bed a little bit away from the window so i couldn t feel the draught as much window also didn t do anything to reduce traffic noise would have been nice to be able to get some food in the hotel arrived late on my first evening hoping to get something light at the bar but was presented with a take away menu for a pizza joint thankfully there s a subway close by
