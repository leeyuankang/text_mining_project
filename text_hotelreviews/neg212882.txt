bathrooms are not clean the shower door was broken lots of scratches on the wall the towels are very old there is no privacy at all i could even listen to the guest who was staying next to my room while he was talking on the phone it s like a fitting room i could also listen to people who are walking in the upper floor because of the ceiling it s like made from wood in short it deserves a stars hotel not at all the value of money is not worth it as well
