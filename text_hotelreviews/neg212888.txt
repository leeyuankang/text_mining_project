room was really small it was a single deluxe deluxe very much refers to the look of the furnishings vs it feeling like a luxury room as a petite person and only staying nights it worked for my needs but would have struggled to stay longer in this size room as you could literally walk in door just about walk round the bed and then into bathroom the bathroom is adequate for one person but there isn t turning space for those of us that are a bit larger or a little infirm as they didn t have an evening restaurant if you wanted the option to bring food into your room you wouldn t be eating in great comfort this also applies to those travelling for business where would you work as the desk had the tea tray on it so you would have to put it on the floor to use as a work space i had managed to get a decent room rate but if i had paid normal rates i don t think i would have been as happy to accept as value for money i understand that they are using the space to full capacity but it also means everything is very close together
