single room had a tiny bathroom no room to swing legs round the toilet so had to sit sideways shower cubicle so small i had to enter it sideways and could not bend down in it to wash my legs room was noisy at night the head of the bed was foot from the raised door which had a inch gap under it this meant all the corridor noise was loud no double glazing either thankfully i had ear plugs
