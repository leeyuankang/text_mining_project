we have reserved a deluxe double room however the room had only a bed with a size of cm x cm which rates as single according to international standards we couldn t even fit two pillows on it next to each other and the room was so tiny that there wasn t enough space between the bed and any of the walls to fit our normal sized luggage the staff advised us to leave our luggage at the reception however there was not even a cupboard in the room where we could put our clothes only a small rack for the coats there was just enough space between the bathroom and the bed to open its door but once it was open the only way to enter it was through the bed this room was much smaller than you expect at any hostel at a price of an expensive star hotel there were also hairs on the bed and in the shower and also one of the towels had brown spots after some extremely frustrating and heated debates with the very unprofessional and arrogant staff the manager the manager of the manager and the manager of the manager of the manager we got discount for that night breakfasts but for the quality it was still way overpriced from the next day we could move to another room which was much bigger than the first one but the quality was still not high overall our stay was a nightmare so i would not recommend this hotel to anybody
