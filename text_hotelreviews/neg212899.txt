the staff were lacking in customer skills the first problem was that i had booked a twin room and was made to feel as if i was causing a problem when i corrected the receptionist by showing my booking was for a twin not the double i was being offered this was eventually sorted out milk was not replaced in the twin room and when ordered through reception never materialised my niece came to my single room to see if i had any and was questioned by someone who appeared to be part of the maintenance team and when she explained what she was doing she was told that she should go upstairs and that she was stupid when checking out this was all related to the receptionist who just shrugged her shoulders and said that it was not her problem as she had not been on duty we were really impressed with the rooms and the location but will not be revisiting the hotel as the attitude of the staff was very disappointing and rude
