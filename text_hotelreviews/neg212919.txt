the wallpaper and headboard were stained and marked it is on a busy road with traffic and emergency vehicles through the night the doors to all the guest rooms bang everytime someone comes in or out so i was woken through the night until with people coming and going the pillows were like rocks even leaving one soft or feather pillow in the wardrobe would be a good idea there was no pen i eventually found a tiny pencil but this was no good for the work i needed to do surely a biro of some description isn t too much of an expense
