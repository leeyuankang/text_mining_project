when we arrived at the hotel we found it was being refurbished and our rooms were no longer available which is something you normal contact someone about if you then have a change of plans however by looking at the hotel and the greeting of the staff anything could be better they moved us across the road at park grand where it was lovely but i just don t understand why no cantact had been made to tell us we were being moved
