this hotel was booked as it is advertised as having car parking facility only to arrive and find that the facility is not available and wont be available to guests until after september this is because they are having renovations done on the property and are concerned that there could been falling debris masonry onto parked cars although there is no restriction on pedestrians in the exact area when questioned are you not concerned about debris falling on people more than on a car that can be repaired there was little response clearly a major health and safety issue as parking was the key factor we did not stay and moved to an hotel across the road
