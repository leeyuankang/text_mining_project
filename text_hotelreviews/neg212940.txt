this was our visit to this hotel and sadly had it been our first visit it would of been our last our visit we were told on arrival we were being moved to their sister hotel due to ongoing building work visit was fine and we were unaffected by the continued refurbishment and were informed by the manager that we would experience a fantastic service on our return sadly that wasn t the case due to the work still being carried out and the noise levels first thing were awful on the floor the entrance exit to the lift also on the floor had a loft ladder in front of it so caused a bit of an obstacle with our luggage if we had been aware of this building work at the time of booking we would of avoided but this was the time with no mention of the refurbishment until you arrive and see the signs in the lift
