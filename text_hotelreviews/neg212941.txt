i was transferred to the grand park hotel as shaftesbury is undergoing construction the hotel is not so far from the original hotel and they provided complimentary breakfast to make up for the unexpected transfer so i think it was fine however i was disappointed how small the room is i booked for a deluxe single room from shaftesbury but i feel that this one is really small
