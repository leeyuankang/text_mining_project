when i arrived at i was told i had been booked into their sister hotel and when i complained they then gave me a room in the hotel but someone had been smoking in it so i had no choice but to complain i was the told they would order me a taxi to the sister hotel so i waited for five minutes but then i was offered a room just off the lobby which was fine although noisy because of its proximity to the lobby
