language barrier with reception staff and not helpful no previous warning of the big renovation going on at hotel which we were told will be going on for next couple of months i don t mind a small room but this was basically a single with two beds pushed in hardly any floor space to move around not able to open bathroom door more than half way as the beds were in the way and low ceiling would have been totally unsuitable for a large person i sent an email to the central booking team on our return and nearly a week later have not even recieved an acknowledgement back general impression is they couldn t care less once they have your money
