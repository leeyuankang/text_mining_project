i have just returned after a night stay in june there is nothing advertised when booking to say they are renovating floors it was booked for a special occasion so this was really disappointing there was scaffolding on the front and back of the building with building work from to although you could hear them in the room above us from was just a shame as it was a special occasion to find surprise building work think it would be polite to let people know before they arrive
