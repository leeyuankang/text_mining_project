i was most disappointed with the hotel it is undergoing major refurbishment had we known we would not have booked we have stayed previously in a hotel that was undergoing a refurbishment we should have been told about this and been given the opportunity to book a different hotel and if the room was a deluxe double i m at a loss to see why the room was very small you had to edge sideways to get between the bed and the wall to get from the door to the hanging space for our clothes and as for the bathroom apologies for getting personal but you could not sit on the toilet properly as it was too close to the wall in front of you the corridor our room was in room ground floor had been blocked off just passed it so the chambermaids trolley and the dirty washing was right outside of the door and it appeared that there was a smoking area in the street outside of the window as regularly workers were there smoking i cannot see how this warrants status we would not stay again at this hotel
