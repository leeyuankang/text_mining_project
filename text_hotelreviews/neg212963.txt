there was construction going on all around the hotel when i arrived the staff felt like they didn t really acknowledge me at all when i arrived and were far too busy in conversation with each other the room itself stank of dampness and smoke and the corridors we literally taped up with water running down the walls overall a very poor experience will not be returning
