the room is incredibly small the distance between the foot of the bed and the wall is approximately inches and if you want to reach the window or use the telephone without scrambling over the bed you have to squeeze through this narrow passage i had only a holdall and was able to deposit this in the aforementioned narrow space this would not be possible with a large suitcase and i am at a loss as to where one could deposit a large suitcase let alone more than one large suiitcase except in front of the door which would make it very difficult to open the door from outside at i consider that the room was extremely overpriced
