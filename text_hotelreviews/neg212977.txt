when we arrived the entire hotel was clad in scaffolding at the front desk i asked if our room was free of scaffolding and was told that the only rooms open were in the basement there was no mention of this on viking com or the hotel website which is pretty outrageous the room was built under the pavement in front of the hotel and had a small frosted glass window looking out except you couldn t look out onto some kind of store room hard to tell almost no natural light in the room people talked just outside the window evening in the middle of the night possibly staff having a cigarette break the room itself was very small for the charged for the one night the hot water took ages to heat up the cold water tap ran warm for ages the air conditioning unit rattled no breakfast included in the the front desk apologised for the building work when i first arrived and asked about having a room without scaffolding i pointed out there was no note about the construction work when i looked and booked online he said customers who rang were informed but most people book online clearly i would not have booked this hotel in this state if i had known and i regard the lack of warning as extremely bad trading practice
