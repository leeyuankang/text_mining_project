star is more than enough for this hotel we arrived me and my husband around and hadnt be late we were to leave to another hotel the second we opened the door it stank of mold and dirt room hadnt been cleaned for decades everything stank even the bed sheets there were fliplops on the floor from previous guest and floor was covered with white bits the biggest surprise was the filthy bathroom where there was urine spots on the stool floor dirty and shower all stained we ended up sitting the rest of the night we couldnt touch anything didnt even take our shoes off simply disgusting
