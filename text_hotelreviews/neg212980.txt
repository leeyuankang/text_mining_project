i have stayed at the hotel from to of may despite the hotel being very nice with a comfy bed v good breakfast nice location the whole experience was disappointing on my arrival after i was told that the hotel undergoes refurbishment and that they have to accommodate all the guest at another hotel just cross the road i was offered to pay straight away after what i was accompanied to another hotel i refused to pay and chose to see the room at another hotel first after i checked the room i immediately realised this is not the category of the room i paid for first thing which i confirmed after checking the rates on the booking com webpage after long telephone discussions of a very friendly receptionist from this alternative hotel i was sent back to where i started and surprise they do accommodate all guests despite the refurbishment i was upgraded to the room of the next category in the end and received a bottle of wine but the aftertaste after these tricks of the personnel is highly unpleasant
