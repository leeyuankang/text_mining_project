the hotel was cramped and claustrophobic there was practically no space in the room to work the bathroom was tiny and we both had difficulty using the shower because we had to step over the toilet bowl to get through the door there was little space shelf to put soap and razors flannels were not provided which is unusual in a modern hotel these days
