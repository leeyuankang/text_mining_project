the rude and unhelpful staff the fact that there was no manager present until i mentioned the bad review i was going to give them and that they charged us for a room also the room we booked wasn t available due to refurbishment but we were only made aware of this on arrival and me and my female friend had to settle for a double room to avoid us having to travel even further and miss our appointment
