the fact that i had booked this hotel in january and asked for quiet adjoining rooms with good views and we didn t get any of theses instead we got one room in the basement witch was very dark as it had a very small obscure window witch looked out on to the bin area that accounted for the smell witch wafted around the area outside our room this is were the staff had there break who were all very noisy talking late at night i phoned reception to complain about the noise it took them min to answer the phone in witch he left me hanging on the line while he went to tell them to be quiet we could still hear them after he told them to be quiet only they had lowered there voices my daughter was running the london marathon the next day and needed her rest that is why i asked for a quiet room my sister in laws room was much brighter with patio doors witch were a joke as they should of led onto a patio area but there was huge tanks and pipes every were why they would have these doors in this room when you can t even go out side so much for asking for a room with a view also the next morning i asked if there was a courtesy room for my daughter to use after the marathon to take a shower but they said they didn t have one most hotels do have courtesy rooms not good will i be returing to the shafsbury hotel no way
