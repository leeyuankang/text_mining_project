i was very unhappy about the pre authorisation as it could have ruined my stay i didn t see the pre auth when it clearly said you don t pay until you get there i then had the full amount locked from my account the day before my stay then once i payed the pre auth stayed on my account so for the weekend i payed for the accomodation twice the pre auth finally cleared days later but this could have left me with no money as i wasn t planning to have another taken from me while i was away
