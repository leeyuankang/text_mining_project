i have never stayed in such a small room glad we only had small overnight bag as you would not have been able to fit two suitcases in it let alone open them the shower was like standing in a upright coffin it was that small i couldn t raise my arms up to wash hair and to open and shut the shower door required contortionist skills don t even think about dropping the soap there was a very peculiar smell and the window was damaged and wouldn t close tight or lock with a communal balcony this made us feel vulnerable if this was the deluxe room
