after carefully planning my trip we arrived and told we had to go to another hotel we were not pleased we were told we had a room upgrade we got to the room and it was tiny i think we were down graded we then told the front desk they moved us to another room which was a bit bigger this was supposed to be a surprise weekend for my wife which turned out to be not as i expected just as well an evening at the theatre was superb
