almost everything i was very disappointed the pictures on booking com were very different from the actual rooms rooms are old incredibly small i had to choose between using the bed to open my bag or sleep in it there was no room to open my travel bag i ve travelled to countries so far and been to hundreds of hotels around the world this hotel does not deserve stars staff dont speak good english and are not that much helpful the stairs in the room the amenities everything is below what u find in stars in other places highly not recommended
