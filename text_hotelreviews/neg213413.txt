bedroom was directly next door to the front door so you heard everyone coming in at all hours then there was another door leading to the other ground floor rooms so everyone had to walk past me and about six feet from my room was the lift so people congregated outside my bedroom door waiting for the lift i have never stayed in such a poorly located room do not stay in room
