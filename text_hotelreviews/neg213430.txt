the room was tiny and i had to roll over the side of bed just to get to the closet the mattress felt as though you were sleeping on a portable cot it was not comfortable at all not much space for anything for the price the staff were deceitful in helping me trying to resolve a refund of one night due to the closing of public transportation on christmas day and i would not have had a way to get to the airport i did not know this until i came to london they pretended that they spoke with the manager and that the manager so called spoke with booking com it was a lie i would not reccomend this hotel to anyone the inconveniece was not worth the price
