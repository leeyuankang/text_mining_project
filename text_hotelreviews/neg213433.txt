if you park outside the hotel at night it s so best off finding a single yellow line if possible watch out for the several steps down as you open the door you think it s only going to be one step but it s several windows weren t double glazed so it s quite noisy if you re staying at the front of the hotel and if you re lucky like my friend was he was approached by prostitutes as he parked up asking if he wanted any company for the night good to see paddington still retains its sleazy side
