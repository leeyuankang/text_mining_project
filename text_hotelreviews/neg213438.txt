this was a very late booking done online only hours before our arrival at around but i would have expected that once booking was made that our room should have been prepared for us on entering the bottom corridor that led to our ground floor club twin room it felt very cold and unfortunately the room itself was freezing the heating system didn t seem to throuw out any heat when turned on and then we found a plug in oil filled heater radiator which heated up but the room was so cold i wanted to get into bed to get changed the beds too were really cold the room felt like it had not been used in a long time further evidence of this was a big cobweb coming down from the ceiling and joining to the scatter cushion on my bed so we went to bed very cold and then woke at am as the room was then too warm with the oil heater on so turned it off if the room beds had been warmed and aired prior to arrival i m sure we would have been happy didn t stay for breakfast so can t give any opinion on food but the staff on reception were curteous and polite and apologised for the complaint about the room temperature when we checked out i should have complained when we first arrived but we were tired from journey and had an early morning start so we probably wrongly just put up with it no view from room in morning we realised that we looked out onto a blind alley we had asked for an upper floor room but as i said it was a late booking
