hmmm where do i start after trying aimlessly for over an hour to find the hotel which is set back from the road with very little signage we were shown to a tiny room that overlooked an inner air ventilation system i immediately phone the reception to ask if this was actually a double deluxe room we were then given another room that was bigger i wondered why we were not given this room in the first place the room was clean but showed a lot of use and could have had a spruce the glass in the bathroom door was so dirty it looked like it needed replacing the rooms are very dark with very little natural light and poor lighting on our first night at we answered our room door to find a member of staff asking if we requested more water we kindly refused minutes later we had a phone call from reception rudely asking us if we had been smoking in our room and blunting and very accusingly stating that we would be fined if we had then just as blunt and rude the receptionist stated we would be having a room inspection because there was a very strange smell in the corridor i had also noticed the smell on arrival but it was not in relation to our room i was infuriated at this accusation we are a middle aged couple and not some unrespectful party animals after waiting until for our very unprofessional room inspection i called reception and requested it immediately we had been travelling all day and wanted our sleep needless to say the terrible smell was not from us but we never got an apology maybe the unprofessional receptionist and the tired small and dark rooms why you are asked to pay on arrival you may not want to pay on departure
