i had specifically requested to pay in advance via bank transfer for my clients who were staying even though i had proof of payment from the bank they still would not accept this and charged my clients again at check in offering a refund when they received my transfer this caused me great embarrassment and when i called to deal with the problem all i asked for was a phone call to update me the following day so this did not happen on the second night but i did not receive a call and again my guests were refused check in for the second time as supposedly the money had not be transferred i only spoke with one staff member who was remotely helpful and unfortunately i do no know his name
