i was put at my arrival at the shaftsbury park garden as an upgrade single room with single bed but at as i was the last time at the shaftesbury paddington was the single room with no single bed the room and bathroom were bigger at the paddington and it is closer to the paddington station the single rooms can be only reached be small stairs at the paddington with an elevator as i asked for a bigger room and i would pay for the upgrade they said that this is not possible in my opinion a downgrade for this price
