the initial room we were placed in would have struggled to accommodate midgets there was a sign on the door mind the step very misleading as there were about steps and a landing before you descended into another level where the bed resided so tight up against the wall who ever was that side who have had to clamber over the other one to visit the toilet which was on the landing half way up the stairs it would have suited single occupancy only and if we had been unable to change rooms we would have left and demanded a refund
