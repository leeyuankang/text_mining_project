the single room was the smallest i have ever stayed in and i travel to japan a lot you could not even walk around the bed to reach the telephone as the pointless wardrobe actually hit the bed corner when i checked into my room there was another persons bag still in it i called reception to inform them i had just flown from australia and had an urgent meeting so had no time to wait for them to sort the problem out after mins i had to call again as no one had arrived
