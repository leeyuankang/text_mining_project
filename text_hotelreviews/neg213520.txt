i brought my mum and dad away and paid for family rooms hoping they d be beside each other they were on different floors it was badly marked on how to get to each room my parents view was a generator that made a drilling noise across the ceiling all night and they had a bad sleep we called a member of staff up to hear how bad the noise was he said he d make a note of it our room was v cramped you can t open the bathroom door fully because it bangs off the bed
