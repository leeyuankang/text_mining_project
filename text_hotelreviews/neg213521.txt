room and bathroom size are a joke i know it s central london but for the room was extremely tiny even though i m not claustrophobic perhaps suitable for a year old not for adults for example you can barely sit on the toilet between the shower and the wall and if you want to wipe your behind you have to get up turn to degrees put your head in the shower and then go for it doors on the corridor have poor shutting system and they slam so hard which makes it quite disturbing when other residents keep going in and out
