we had booked two rooms twin deluxe for our teenagers double deluxe for us the twin room was okay the double was truly terrible nothing more than a closet in the basement two people couldn t fit in without one staying in bed to call this deluxe is horrendous we refused to stay and were promptly moved to a better room and another the next day hairdryer was missing in both rooms access to fitness center in nearby hotel as is stated on booking com showed up not to be available the staff looked pretty blank when asked about this we overheard at least five other guest complaints about the room size while we were at this hotel stay clear unless you are guaranteed a room on an upper floor
