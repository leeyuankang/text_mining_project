overpriced for what it is and i think it s to much for this hotel to have four stars one other thing during my stay one day they forgot to clean my room although i put the the sign of please make up my room on the door in the morning and when i came back in the evening the sign was still on the door and they didn t clean the room so where were the housekeeping and their supervisors to check after them this what they do in four stars hotels
