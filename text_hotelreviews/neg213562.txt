bathroom is extremely small men who are a little bigger than the average size will have problems getting in to and out of the shower stall the room is very small staff is friendly but their knowledge on how to use the metro tube restaurants attractions etc is pretty limited the breakfast is okay you can probably do better eating at nearby cafes
