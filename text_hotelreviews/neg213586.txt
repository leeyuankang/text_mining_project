i booked a deluxe double room but it was anything but deluxe very poor in terms of normal legitimate expectation of such a room both in terms of size where the shower in the ensuite was absolutely sub standard as you had no room and the wardrobe was much too small for its intended purpose the floor constantly creaked underfoot and every movement from the next room was audibly visible the lights were constantly on the blink and even the tv was temperamental during turning on off not good value for money
