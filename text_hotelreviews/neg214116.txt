upon check in i was told that the room i had booked had some issue with electricity hence i had to be transferred to other shaftesbury hotel notingham hill slightly about minutes away by taxi the room i was given had windows facing a big air condition generator which was rather too noisy luckily due to lack of sleep on the plane i had fallen asleep but was woken up by the not pleasant noise would definitely ask for a room with windows facing the main street also shower cube is too little i barely fit in and i am just average so bear that in mind if you are bigger built
