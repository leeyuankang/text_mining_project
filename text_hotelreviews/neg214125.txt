rooms very small for what you pay window doesn t open just cm no air into the room at all my worst room ever pictures in the booking com are showing big rooms no way near the truth i booked a deluxe double room and didnt have even a chair to sit on although in the picture it shows one a real cheat would not recommend this hotel to anyone in fact i will start making negative advertising
