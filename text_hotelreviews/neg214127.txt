the room was no bigger than my laundry i am and slim build and i had to turn sideways to fit between the desk and bedside table there was no where to put my case to easily access its contents i had to leave the bathroom door open so i had enough room to dry off after showering very poor value for money would not stay there again the room was so small i am surprised it meets regulation standards
