hotel got integrity issue beware what you see is not what you get they show nice photos of the room when you do the biking but in actual fact what you get is not not what they shown on the photos i booked the hotel through booking com but what i got was totally different from what i have booked the room i got was half the size of what they shown on the photos and the room given to me many issues when i asked the staff why i got the room so different from what i have booked the staff didn t apologized instead she made it sounded that i was the one who was being unreasonable she even told me that the room that was given to me was the same as what i has booked at this point i was really angry how could a room that is half the size of what i has booked was the same as what i has booked after much demand they gave me the room which look the next day if you need to book this hotel because of the location my advise is to make sure you get the room that they some on the website i sincere hope is that the management will stop sucj unethical way of getting business please show the actual room in the website and don t deceive you customers
