beginning to look a bit shabby i have been staying here for years i like the area and feel the cost isn t prohibitively high however in the time the rooms have been showing considerable wear and the appointments not repaired correctly nor replaced the service is good but not outstanding i have never eaten here so unable to comment one note the toilet seat wasn t firmly attached may be that way for ease of cleaning but almost slipped off as it tried to come off as i was leaning forward a bit disconcerting this may have been in this room only but for an older person may in fact be dangerous i will still stay here in the future but only if the deal is right
