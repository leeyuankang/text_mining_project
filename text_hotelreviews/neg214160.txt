we booked a double deluxe room but when we checked in it was the size of a shoe box nothing like what is advertised on their website we complained at reception and they advised us that was size of all the deluxe double rooms and some of them were even smaller we were then offered a twin bedded room so i politely advised them that i had not come to london for a long weekend to sleep in separate beds after a lot of talking and a phone call to booking com another receptionist stepped in and advised that there were no other rooms available for that night but if we could stay in that room for the first night she would upgrade us free of charge to a club deluxe room for the next two nights and with a complimentary breakfast after our first nights stay we were shown a club deluxe room before we made up our minds surprisingly the room was what we were expecting the double deluxe to be so upon returning to reception we agreed that we were happy with that and we were advised just to leave our bag in the room the following morning and they would take it to our new room and that is what they did they also gave us a bottle of red wine and a platter of fruit as an apology but if it hadn t been for the other receptionist stepping in they would have had two very unhappy people
