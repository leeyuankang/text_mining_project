this hotel has cheated us we have paid for a double bedroom the bed size is so small that a normal couple cannot fit on it unless they stick to each other sleep this hotel is a fraud please clarify there has to be a minimum size for a bed to be called a double bed to the best of my knowledge a double bed cannot be less than feet in width we asked the reception for a measuring tape but did not get one our assumption is that the bed was about feet in width our room no was you can send your rep to verify if this can be called a double bed
