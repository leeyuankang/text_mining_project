good value for the area but i would expect breakfast to be included when paying in excess of for a night was not even offered the pre ordered option didn t bother me too much as i had plenty of time to get breakfast somewhere else main problems were many of the bedrooms along with the bar and restaurant are in the basement my room was below the tied in the front of the hotel it also smelt damp when i arrived i opened the window and put on the bathroom fan to get some fresh air and it soon went i was awoken at by staff carrying items up the fire escape outside my window and loading some sort of truck while the staff attempted to be quiet there was little they could do so while it was an ok stay for the money i wouldn t stay again
