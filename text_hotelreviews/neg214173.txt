the room was terribly small one of the smallest i have had for a couple could barely move stay was spoiled by the policy of the hotel and inflexibility as well as the lack of helpfulness of booking com i had signalled ahead my girlfriend would book in and i would check in and pay the next day when she arrived they demanded full payment there and then which she couldn t meet so she had not choice but to take a separate new booking of a room for one night and cancelled the old booking completely incurring me a one night penalty when i arrived the next day i had to take a brand new booking how insane is that lost a whole room night in cost but luckily had not made the whole booking a nonrefundable one
