i didn t stay here they switched me to the one across the road park grand london hyde park i wasn t too fussed but i could see that annoying some they re under the same umbrella though shaftesbury i stayed a few weeks folks and it s a min walk from paddington station so i was thinking good base and it s so easy to get to i stayed in a deluxe single room now yes it s small but i m not a big person so it was fine for me bed was comfy and the tv was in a good spot on the wall opposite bathroom is tinyyyyy the shower is very narrow but great pressure i grew used to it but ended up leaving the bathroom door open every time i showered just me so it didn t matter criticism would be no shelf for your toiletries there is one directly above the toilet but that s just odd there s no iron or hairdresser in the room and the bar fridge concealed in the desk isn t plugged in the lifts didn t go to my room so it was up two very narrow staircases to it the porter took my case up and down upon check out as it was and i would ve struggled put bluntly a massive unit wouldn t do so well in a single room from my understanding the rooms aren t that big anyway but maybe pick a double incase there was room for my suitcase near the desk and i just shoved any shopping or my backpack in front of the window the doors are so loud when they shut only annoyed me on my last two nights due to new next door neighbours constantly slamming theirs at night the corridors smelt a bit musty but it s an old hotel done up not too badly overall it wasn t too bad i could see people bulking at the size it is essentially a biggish shoe box but was still doable when i was able to catch up with my man for a few hours haha it ain t stars though no way but hardly a hovel
