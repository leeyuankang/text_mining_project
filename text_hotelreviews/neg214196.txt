room size we booked two rooms for one night and both were tiny one room was in the basement and the other room was very small that you can t even move around the bed i have never seen anything like this in my whole life i asked the staff to change the room and they said they only have one available room that was the same size we ve spent more than two hours following a hour long journey in the reception trying to cancel our booking but after numerous calls between the reception reservation centre and booking com they said they can t ensure any refund before the morning so we stayed that night at the hotel anyway and haven t got any response from them it was a horrible experience the mobile signal was also very poor
