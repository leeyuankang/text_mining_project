the room was advertised as a deluxe double the room was big enough for a single bed and certainly should not be referred to as a deluxe double on the day we arrived there was a white hairbrush on the floor beside the locker so the room was not cleaned properly i didn t pick it up the next day it was on the locker when we arrived back the rooms should be cleaned thoroughly between guests lockers etc should be pulled out and the area cleaned the description of the room size caused us great disappointment for the money we paid i have used booking com before but i am not sure if i will use it again
