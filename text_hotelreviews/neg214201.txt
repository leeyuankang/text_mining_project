the room was tiny and a bit run down it was also in the basement the whole hotel needs a bit of renovation while it was generally clean it wasn t spotless clean which is what you d expect from a stars hotel and the price the bath didn t look clean enough to lie in and there was a white crusty stain on the bed headboard i also had to pay additionally for breakfast in general a disappointment upon arrival as it looks much better on the pictures
