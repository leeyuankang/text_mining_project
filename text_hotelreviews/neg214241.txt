mine was meant to be a deluxe room i can say that after more than years of continuous travelling in hotels of or stars i had never been in a room so ridiculously small not even in tokyo which is famous for that and moreover they did not even bother to put a hook for the towel in the room nor a small tray for the teeth brush and in the room there was no space for my small suitcase not even in the floor so if i wanted to go to the toilet i had to move it away and block the door of the guard robe and so on it was extremely uncomfortable for that reason
