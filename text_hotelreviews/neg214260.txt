our room was tiny it was pretty much a bed room there was a wardrobe but you couldn t really open it and be in the room at the same time there was very little space for bags etc having seen the photos and paid a reasonable price we had expected a bit more space and a bath too we only had a shower aircon was a little frustrating too the lowest temp we could get was which on a mega hot day wasn t great
