i had a single room which was tiny i was kicking myself as had meant to book the double through booking com which was the same price i asked them could i change to a double for the night but they said there wasnt a vacancy even though booking com was showing one so dont go for the single room i had left my big suitcase at the airport just as well as i would not have fitted it in the room the lighting also was poor in one half of the room so hard to see if you wanted to make a cup of tea or something in the night time
