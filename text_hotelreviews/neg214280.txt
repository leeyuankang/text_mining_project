greeted by a very stand offish receptionist i m assuming she doesn t have a good command of english as we had trouble getting a clear answer to our questions also don t appreciate being spoken to rudely after a long day of travelling and all you want is to settle in to your room other receptionists were patient and nice i e for checkout and other queries
