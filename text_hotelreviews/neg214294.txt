the heat was not adjustable the breakfast was not good and service lacked horribly at breakfast and we waited and waited for coffee and tea to be served they seemed short staffed the table was wobbly and there could be tablecloths or something to make it more elegant the selection wasn t good i ve eaten much nice breakfasts at even an ibis hotel
