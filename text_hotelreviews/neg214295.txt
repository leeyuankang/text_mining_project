whilst the breakfast was good the service was chaotic the girls would take an order and then nothing would appear the tureen used for the scrambled egs was empty so i left the lid off so the wait staff could see that one staff member saw the lid off and replaced it without replenishing the contents the girls mostly from eastern europe were most pleasant but seemed to have no system or organisation for dealing with an influx of customers i suggest they keep customers at the door until a table is available take the clients there and take their order their for tea coffee there and then instead people are finding any table that is empty whether it has been re laid or not and sitting down the system is very inefficient
