we had specifically booked this hotel as it offered a twin room important for us as my husband has a bad back on arrival we were told this was not available and offered a double bedded room with a small double bed or single rooms after explaining our reasons and being quite firm we were finally offered a double bedded room with a slightly larger bed which we had to take better than the original but not a good night s rest for a higher price than we would have liked
