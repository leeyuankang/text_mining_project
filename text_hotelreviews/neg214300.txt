i booked this hotel but i was told to stay shaftesbury metoloporis which is mins walk from the hotel because their hot water was not working they arranged complementary taxi and breakfast for us but the reason i booked shaftsbury premier london paddington is because it s closer to the station even the room charge is more expensive than shaftesbury metolopolis the deluxe double room was extremely small hall way is super narrow and there are steps and doors that make us very hard to walk with luggage a green light on the ceiling bothered us whole night moreover when i was checking out at metolopolis i saw the guests are told to stay other hotels because this hotel now has a hot water problem i felt so weird
