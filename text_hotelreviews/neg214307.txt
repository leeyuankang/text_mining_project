the room was abnormally small it was advertised as a double and i paid more for the size unfortunately the room was miniscule there is no way two people could even be in the room at the same time this is mis advertising at its worst you literally could not sit forward on the toilet as it was so close to the wall the room was a single at best and should never be advertised as a double i felt cheated and upset there was also a fight in the hall at am overall i was very disappointed as the room was not as advertised
