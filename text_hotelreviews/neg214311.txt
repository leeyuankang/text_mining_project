i thought there might be an in house restaurant for evening meals but instead i was handed a pizza takeaway menu i was upgraded to a double room which was appreciated but it was cramped and impossible to walk round the foot of the bed only way to draw undraw the curtains was scrambling over the bed admittedly i was on my own but if my wife had been here one of us would have been scrambling over the other basement room view none obviously to be expected if you get a basement room
