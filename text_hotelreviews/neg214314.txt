tiny room difficult to swing a cat but ideal for hobbits we asked for a room on an upper floor but were put in the basement the shower screen in the very tiny bathroom was far too small which meant if you had a shower you inadvertently flooded the bathroom the bathroom door was very weird as it had a transparent panel which meant you could see what anyone was doing inside which is a little odd when staying in a tiny room with your teenage son who s bed was immediately in front of the door corridors in basement were a maze to get lost in perhaps some signs back to reception would help
