nothing could be improved if all the rooms were this small we could not unpack the case i had to climb over my partner to get out of bed for the bathroom the room was so small you could not pass one another the room was dark and it was difficult to read a book or newspaper i feel when you book through you the rooms we are given are perhaps top floor and smallest we literally only slept in the room
