it stated that my room would be ready for but when u got there past it still wasn t ready and at first didn t want to give me a different room didn t like the fact that they actually take two lots of money out of ur bank account and then u have to wait five days later for one lot to return into ur account just felt like the room was slightly too small and cramped and needed finishing off ie missing or broken bits
