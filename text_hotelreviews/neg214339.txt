overall excellent a few small niggles the d cor in my room was very pink there was a bath but no shower except that extension thing for your hair i didn t like the squeezy soap shampoo dispensers little bottles would look less institutional especially considering this is a hotel in any case since there is no shower the placement of said squeezy bottle should be closer to the bath otherwise its all rather awkward the wifi speed was ok but not as fast as we ve come to expect in modern hotels problem existed both on my ipad and with my laptop i stress though that these are very small niggles i d happily return to this hotel and would thoroughly recommend it
