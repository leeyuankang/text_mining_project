the rooms are below my expectations especially having just left a very nice hotel in london with same rating to compare though reasonably clean the rooms needed refurbishment as outdated especially the bathroom desperately in need of upgrading on a positive note the staff i spoke to were very helpful and speak good english which helped a lot with my queries
