the breakfast is very bad nor even the bread is good and being in france it would not be dificult to serve a simple french baguette all the food is artificial and of low quality the staff at the restaurant is unpolite hard to welcome you and say good morning other staff like the cleaning ladies were very polite at night you can intensively hear other guests entering their rooms specially the doors closing
