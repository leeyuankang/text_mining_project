we booked a suite but this maybe the biggest room in mimi s but not a suite by any definition it was a smallish room with a double bed and a tiny armless chair that is it we got to the hotel hour before check in the room was ready but we were told that we would have to pay an extra to go in the room what the i have never come across this before anywhere in the world fair enough if it was a few hours before but it is really noisy outside the hotel so you will need their complimentary ear plugs
