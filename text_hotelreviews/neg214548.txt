if you have a room with a window and you don t sleep well you can find the rooms a bit noisy i love the sounds of a city so no probs for me there is very little room to put your stuff away so the room easily gets messy the rooms are small but very very comfortable despite this i will always visit mimi s when i want to visit soho covent garden etc
