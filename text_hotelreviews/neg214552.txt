we were in a basement windowless room and so were woken up by deliveries in the morning the bed was squeezed between two walls so access was difficult there was no power point next to the bed or nightstand or bedside shelf for water things the room also had no wardrobe or any means to hang up clothes other than one hook behind the door the lighting in the bathroom was very dark and there was no magnifying mirror applying make up as difficult
