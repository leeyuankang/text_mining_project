the room was tiny there was no wardrobe in the room only legs with hangers plus legs in the bathroom there was no chair to sit just a little stool we stayed for nights and i d asked for a room in the ground floor as i ve got a back problem i booked in february we stayed in july but they couldn t accommodate that one request the lack of amenities in the room made me think that it was a room that they should allocate for single day night bookings certainly not nights most of our clothes had to stay in our suitcase as there were only hangers and hanging pegs there was no iron to use and because the room was so small we had to keep the suitcases on top of a dressing table a dressing table that had no mirror to use while i did my makeup so i used the bathroom for that which meant my hubby my hubby had to wait until i was finished to have a shower because you can t do makeup using a steamed up mirror there is a full length mirror in the room but the lighting in the room was very dim to add a sexy vibe to the room i suppose but it would ve been nice to have the option of having a bright light too esp as the one window we had was tiny the light dimmers by the bed were very temperamental there s only one bedside table this is because although the bed is very comfortable and a great size it was pushed against the wall with the window great fun trying to open and close the curtains so one person always has to climb over the other to get out we ended up moving the pillows to the wall so that we could get out easier but the bed is also very high and both my husband and i found it a challenge to climb into and get off of we both left with sore backs one more thing we decided to have a drink at a table outside so we ordered rhubarb gin and tonics we were charged this is daylight robbery
