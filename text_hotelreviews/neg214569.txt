there weren t any tea and coffee facilities in the room which is a bit bizzare for a hotel in my opinion the immediate area around the hotel needs some regenerating and the local bars attracted some loud characters making sleeping at night a little bit difficult however these are minor faults seeing as though i only really used the room to sleep and nothing more
