the room is ridiculously small even though i normally don t mind the size of the room but this one was basically the bed with ca metres of space on two sides of it with two sides limited to the wall no place to put your things luckily we had only suit case as two would have simply not fit no cupboards no shelves just two small cloaks on the wall for hanging something no space to lay down anything from hands in the bathroom either even if there would be space there to put somekind of a counter next to the sink
