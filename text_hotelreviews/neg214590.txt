the room is tiny which we knew when booking so not a problem but slightly difficult for people to get ready given lack of floor space we thought this room was pay on arrival as all other hotels through booking com have been so were a little disconcerted to find we had been sent an e mail stating that payment had been attempted from the card given and that the room would be cancelled if we did not reply by luckily we checked in before as had not checked emails but we thought this was very harsh and we would have been stranded with no accommodation
