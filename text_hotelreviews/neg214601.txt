payment taken before i arrived my booked room had been taken the room they offered in exchange was dirty the room they finally found for me was in the basement with no windows hot tiny x including the ensuite claustrophobic and barely had room to open the door the essential air con was noisy i woke with a headache the double bed was short enough that i had to sleep diagonally the ensuite was so small that it was hard to bathe and dry without banging elbows and knees for miniscule loo miniscule sink and miniscule shower
