the room we stayed in was painted a plumb colour with the ambient lighting i found it hard to put my makeup on i spoke to the reception staff about this minor issue and they were most helpful giving advice on how to control the lighting they also gave me the numbers of rooms which were painted lighter so that when i came to stay again i could choose another room
