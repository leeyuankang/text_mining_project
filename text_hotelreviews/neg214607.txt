the room was smaller than my garden shed it would have been too small for me on my own and i am petit but was ridiculous for two of us the bathroom was no better you could sit on the toilet wash your feet in the shower and wash your hands in the sink all at the same time we were offered the option to upgrade to a suite albeit more money but it was like being in a cellar okay a bit moe room but no natural daylight so we stuck with the shoe box room
