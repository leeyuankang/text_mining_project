very small rooms booked deluxe double room and what we got was a matchbox no larger than with our bed going from wall to wall so you had to climb from the bottom no window which i understand it is normal at this hotel but the room was not suitable for persons and no vent in the bathroom i would not usually accept this but luckily we were knackered after weeks of traveling and stayed what a mistake very thin walls and i assume next doors bed was very close ours as until our neighbours were having fun but privacy was for them and probably the whole floor could hear unfortunately i would not recommend
