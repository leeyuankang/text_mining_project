the website tells you that the rooms are small i was still not prepared for just how small they do have everything you need though and for the size are well equipped it would be really useful for have a proper hanging rail rather than a double hook and a single hanger the rail could go across the back of the door with a couple of hangers on it it would be great to have a little shelf in the bathroom too i had to balance everything on the loo seat when applying make up
