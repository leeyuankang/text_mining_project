no privacy at this hotel while we were out all of our belongings were packed up without our permission or knowledge and moved to a room the size of a broom closet i m not joking on another floor appaently they had some issue with the water in our room so decided to downgrade us to a smaller room i complained and they refunded just pounds considering we paid over pounds that i would have preferred it if they left our stuff alone in the room that i originally booked and kept the quid also the first morning the cleaning staff unlocked and walked in our room while my partner was getting dressed she quickly grabbed a towel to cover herself not even a knock on the door first
