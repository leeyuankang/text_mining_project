the hotel was quite nice i suppose but they would do well to open a window not everyone appreciates the stuffy smell of old roses the room was tiny even though i expected it to be quite small from having carefully read the website for example unless you are a contortionist you cannot open the door to the hallway without standing in the bathroom and there is no place to put a room service tray but on the floor the bed was the biggest disappointment it represented nearly half of the room s space and the hotel describes it as model what a total disappointment being stiff and uncomfortable to say the least they should offer a thicker mattress pad for those guests who like a soft bed we did get extra pillows from the helpful staff and the bedding was of good quality so they did try to please but everything would have been better had we slept well
