absolutely tiny room literally the size of the bed squeezed in between walls on all four sides with just enough space to open the door and either wedge a case behind the door or put it into the tiny shower room toilet the air freshener used throughout the corridor lifts and stairwell was overpowering almost as if it was covering up something worse absolutely no where to work i wonder why booking com recommended it as a business hotel
