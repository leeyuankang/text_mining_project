the rooms are tiny and although they have done their best to try and manoeuvre around that s it s just way to claustrophobic there is no where to hang clothes or put bags no where to sit and relax and absolutely no window in the room or the bathroom moreover the bedding was not up to a good standard all that was provided was a very thin pills and sheets that felt plasticy furthermore the bar closes very early i believe pm for soho so if you want any tea coffee or alcoholic beverage you have to go to soho to get it just not good enough
