we had a room without a window we found it a little disorientating and the room we decided was too small in fairness we chose the room so not the hotels fault a little disappointed the bar closed at on sunday too the hotel does not make it clear on their website the nearest q parking which is china town so we did not manage to get the discount on the parking we should have had
