the size of the room was extremely small the bed took up the whole room barely any space to move around i booked a deluxe room for two as i was due to have a friend stay with me unfortunately i got notified while i was in route to the hotel the day of saying the room i booked was not available they offered me a room the same size as another friend whom paid for as if it was a great deal when it wasn t i reserved a larger room for two at so can you imagine how upset i was the woman at the front desk says to me you can take this room or go somewhere else in a really rude tone i had just gotten off work and did not want to deal with it anymore mind you i was not yelling and just inquired about why the prices varied so much for the same type of room she said it s because it s the last room i was baffled and couldn t believe it i had to suck it up and pay but honestly it sucked i would have loved it if the room i reserved was available or if they offered me the same price they had for the room of or even a discounted rate for the inconvenience my other guest didn t even come as we were not going to squeeze into that tiny room and try to maneuver
