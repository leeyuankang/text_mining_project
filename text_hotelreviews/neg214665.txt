this hotel charged pounds to my bank account after checkout without consent authorizing my payment hotel claims these are smoking charges in the room when i don t even smoke in return the hotel is now trying to push me from fighting the charge by claiming they are talking to their lawyers i told them they can t do this since i am not responsible for anything that happens in my room after my checkout if there was an issue they should ve informed me while i was at the hotel instead they debited my card without speaking with me what if i didn t notice this on my statement i have contacted the hotel several times sent three emails to them out of which they have replied to just one email i don t understand how they are dealing with their customers beware i would recommend all other guests to be very careful with the card details they provide to this hotel they are misusing these details i have already taken action from my end but i am really shocked and surprised by their behavior extremely unprofessional
