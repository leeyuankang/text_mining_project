rooms are small but we knew that lack of storage drawers wardrobes is an issue but not a big one the worst fault is that the rooms at the front are very poorly insulated against noise not much traffic in mid soho but large numbers of very noisy people emerging from next door bars until the small hours then dustcarts collecting rubbish and reversing noisily at a modern hotel in london shouldn t have these issues which would deter future visits
