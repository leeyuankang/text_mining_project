well on first arrival the first room we were shown was a cupboard with a double bed in the basement which was far from the suite that we booked went back to reception for them to say the suite wasn t ready as it was still being cleaned this was about an hour after check in time so it should have been ready when we came back later to get ready for our night out we entered the room to find a very strong odour of paint then i found wet paint on the door the room itself a suite well im not sure how they can call it a suite as it was tiny i booked a suite as i thought it would be a nice birthday treat but it was just a disappointment there was also a hole in the front door where there once was a spy hole which means any lucky person that looked through it would see us in our room there were no bulbs in the bedside lamps the air conditioning did not work so with no windows and air conditioning the room was very hot and smelly with the paint my partner requested to use an iron to iron his shirt we were told minutes an hour later he had to go back to reception to ask again we conplained to reception and got moved to a dulux double which was pretty much the same as a suite so i wouldnt waste your money on an upgrade shower toilet was exactly the same but at least this room we had space to get dressed without touching the walls after our stay i spoke with management to express my disappointment to them to be told that i would not be welcome at the hotel again
