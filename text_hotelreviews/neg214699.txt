like all other comments the room was the size of the room was the only problem i booked a delux double room it had no window and the bed filled two thirds of the room i had a three night stay there was not room for a wardrobe or no draws to put clothes there was only two coat hangers provided as a result i was literally living out of a suitcase fortunately it did fit under the bed
