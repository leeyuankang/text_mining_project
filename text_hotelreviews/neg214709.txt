this dark basement room was literally the size of the double bed see photos and is the smallest i have stayed in that s saying something as hotel rooms are usually small in the city there was no window only one power socket no wardrobe or place to store clothes or bag luckily i was alone as it was a business trip i can t imagine having two people in that room music played in the corridor outside my room all night they provide earplugs which don t really help i hardly slept as it felt really claustrophobic and was noisy i was notified of no window on booking but had little choice as i was stranded due to storm doris never again
