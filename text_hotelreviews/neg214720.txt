rooms are absolutely tiny with no storage space booked deluxe double but was offered two microscopic rooms before settling on what was still a very small room all windowless even this wasn t the advertised had a tiny hanger cupboard as a wardrobe for people and more of a cloakroom than a bathroom bear in mind that the bed takes up about in the smaller room and you get the idea this makes it very claustrophobic especially as as mentioned by another reviewer the escape signage is severely lacking
