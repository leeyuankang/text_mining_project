even saying that the rooms are small and i was aware of this having no window in my room and the bed enclosed on sides by walls was a touch claustrophobic with only me in a double room it was fine but couples would be very intimate it would also be good to have more cushions in the room as the bed is going to serve as your sofa for watching tv as a one night stop while visiting a client with offices in soho the location made this perfect but wouldn t be on my list for a longer stay
