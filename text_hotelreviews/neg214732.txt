i was given a room in basement with no window and fresh paint smell so strong it made me feel ill i asked to move and only rooms also had no window and even smaller but no paint smell so had to accept the staff person in charge at the time was horrible but the assistant and cleaner who replaced the remote that didn t work were very nice and tried to do their best for me overall a very claustrophobic and upsetting experience though music in bar too loud one beer cost me and hotel very over heated in my windowless room i was using air conditioning all night so stupid
