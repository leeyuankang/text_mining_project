traveller beware i booked the small room rate because oh well it was just for one night well i got what i asked for a room at the end of a corridor in the basement with no window and of room no space to hang your clothes and your head bumps the wall if you need to wipe your bum on the toilet but that was not the worst remember it s a small price for a small room so you get what you book the worst was that i was wondering what would happen in case of a fire i honestly don t want to play out that scenario in that room i m sure there are better rooms that feel safer at this hotel spend the extra money so you re on the ground floor or upper floors with a window trust me it ll do wonders for your peace of mind
