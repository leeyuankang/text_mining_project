do not stay here unless you want to know what sleeping in a coffin is like with really unhelpful hotel management the hotel was in a unfinished state when we arrived with unfinished paint work and dust sheets and with notices to watch your clothes for wet paint there were no signs to help you allocate your room so we ended up going down a wrong corridor i don t recall seeing any fire exit signs or emergency lighting to help you find the way back out either which i thought was actually illegal they appear to be in a rush to take as much money as possible regardless of standard health and safety requirements to their guests the deluxe double room we were given was basically a padded coffin it was so small that it was impossible to close the door when my husband and i entered the room due to us being in the way there were no windows to this coffin and the only access to the bed was an opening of about so unlucky for you if you re the one unfortunate to be sleeping furthest away we both felt instantly claustrophobic we told reception it was way too small and that a room with windows was at least the very minimum one would expect for a expensive deluxe we were offered an identical room of the same microscopic size next to this one which was still being cleaned but with window the housemaid showed us another room that she said was free but we needed to check with reception which was a small but normal room by normal i mean you could actually get to the bed we told reception the second room they offered it was still too small for us they refused to offer us the bigger room and basically blamed us for not looking at the pictures of their hotel prior to booking which i had and they were nothing like the room we were given
