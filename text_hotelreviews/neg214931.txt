it was very hot when we stayed there and the a c in our two rooms was not working and as the street below was so loud we could not open the windows until about when it was quiet enough to do so we only slept of a few hours that night the staff accommodated our request to move to interior rooms that we small and dark but at least the a c worked a little and they were very quiet allowing us to finally get some sleep the breakfast was unimpressive so we went out to local cafes every day
