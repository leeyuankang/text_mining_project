the receptionists including the managers elena was one of them were not helpful as requested when we arrived we needed two different receipts with our name in each receipt for tax purposes we paid with different credit cards and requested those names in the invoice receipt they insisted that the reason that this could not be made was because the reservation was done through booking com although booking com customer support was very helpful the hotel administration was not able to solve this simple problem
