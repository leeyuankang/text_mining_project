filthy dirty hotel with congealing old food left outside the rooms at night and still there at the next morning the stench of old take out food in the corridors is nauseating the rooms had to be changed twice shocking accommodation with no thought given to the layout of the room door opening onto the bed and not able to open further bathroom door opening onto the toilet so that it is virtually impossible to sit on the toilet very old uncomfortable mattresses broken cupboard doors which after complaining for days were still not fixed or attended to on the day useless incompetent unhelpful staff that did nothing and only knew how to apologize but not attend to or resolve anything never again
