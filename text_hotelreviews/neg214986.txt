very basic room mine was facing the street on a low floor and was very noisy because of the street works you can also hear everything from the corridor and i think there was a service room next to mine too the air con was old and made so much noise that all in all i got very bad nights sleep for the price i paid it s quite shocking what you get breakfast is ok but for the cost you can step outside to have an amazing breakfast down the road for half the cost
