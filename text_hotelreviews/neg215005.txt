we were told that not all rooms floors had the air conditioning switched on because it was winter however the room we were offered south facing was very hot indeed and it took some negotiation to be moved to a room where the air conditioning was switched on as it clearly states in the brochure all rooms with air conditioning and most people like to sleep in a fairly cool room i was disappointed otherwise it was all ok
