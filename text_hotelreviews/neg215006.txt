dark lighting in room a light was hanging down out of its holder a little dated decor but the thing that annoyed me the most was as we arrived to the room at three rooms had trays of food from room service i imagine left outside their doors snd the next morning at they were still there i did tell someone on reception and they were removed by the time we returned back to the room definitely not rated in our opinion
