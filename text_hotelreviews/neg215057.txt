staff was very rude and unprofessional obviously they needed a lot of training the conseirge is the worst not only did he not offer to help but he asked me to move my bags to the storage room and then to the room when we checked in we requested an extra bed with the reservation and confirmed so with them days before my travel when we arrived they informed us that there isn t any available and didn t even return my call when i requested for a solution never again to this hotel
