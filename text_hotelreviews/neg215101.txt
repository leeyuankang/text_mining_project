generally it was a good hotel the staff were courteous enough but in our room the shower leaked and wasn t the cleanest the bed light fitting was fitted poorly and was a hazard as it kept swinging down and there were trays of food left down the hallways for extended periods of time even though staff were about please note that despite these few qualms i would stay again
