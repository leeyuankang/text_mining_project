the breakfast was poor wet powdered eggs stale breads lift didn t work one morning requiring up and down flights with briefcase then came back to room on third day to find my room door open nothing stolen but when i talked to the manager all he has to say was he was sorry no adjustment no free drink no breakfast just a weak sorry we also had to leave our room one night at midnight when the fire alarm went off and we were pushed to the street when three fire trucks showed up that was chalked up to a faulty fire alarm but we were told in a letter under our door that that had never happened before
