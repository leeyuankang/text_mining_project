the gentleman who checked us in was very good however on the second day the plug was stuck in the sink which meant that the water did not drain we reported it to the front desk and returned hours later but there was no attemot to fix it so we ended up having to vail out water with a cup into the toilet the next day when we checked out we mentioned it to another member of staff on the desk who didnt even make a note of the problem
