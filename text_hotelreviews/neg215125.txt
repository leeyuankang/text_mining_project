the price of this hotel is absolutely not justified you also need to pay an extra for the wifi and the connection is very low in rooms the most horrible experience was the smell of cigarettes in corridors as non smokers it was really disgusting and one of my friend had to wake up at as the smell was very disturbing when he complained to the reception they even didn t want to call the manager or give manager s e mail in order for us to complain the responsible in charge informed us that they ll identify the person smoking and fine him well we re happy that this over charging hotel is earning more thanks to our discomfort but what do we get
