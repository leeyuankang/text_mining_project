we had requested our room in a quite location in the hotel so we got an internal room but unfortunately there is no roof over the bar area the bar is located in the center of the hotel so the noise rises up past all of the rooms if you have an internal room you don t have an outside window to open the rooms can get very warm and the air con is pretty noisy we requested that our room was made up each day the bed was made and the towels changed etc but our bed linen wasn t changed at all and we stayed a total of nights which was a little disappointing to see
