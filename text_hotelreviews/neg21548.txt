yet again complimentary drinks selection poor and not enough provided when i asked staff who were topping up for more milk he would not give me more yhan three extra the milk portions are tiny and too small and i would say most would use two per cup to outrightly refuse yo give me more even when asked twice and to walk away whilst i asked was frankly rude our friends who also stayed on our recommendation had a disaster with your room service breakfast which they said was very poor value for the money not impressed these little things make all the difference it comes across as penny pinching but will ultimately lose you customers
