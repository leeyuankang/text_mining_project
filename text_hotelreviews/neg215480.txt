when we entered our room just by the lifts we noticed that there were scuff marks around chips out of furniture paint etc but nothing too bad we also noticed that the coffee was plain nescafe very cheap instant coffee and whilst i am a coffee snob would have thought that as a four star hotel they would be inclined to provide something of a bit higher quality we had asked for an outside room and were warned the window was obscured to protect residents in the street behinds privacy so although an outside window no actual view nothing so far to really complain about we went out in the evening to a concert arriving back about we both had a shower and pulled the bed sheets back to go to bed now about am as we pulled the sheets back the top stuck to the bottom and there was chewing gum on the sheets we called reception and despite explaining the problem they sent a night worker up with a single sheet he went away and came back and changed the sheets now about we waited in our bathrobes for him to change the sheets a very uncomfortable embarrassing experience but it was done and now very tired we went to bed the room has an obscured window between the bathroom and the bedroom so this means in the daytime you can see each others outline in each room but in the night if you need to use the bathroom and turn the light on you wake the person sleeping we were also woken by people outside the room waiting for the lift when it came to checkout i was expecting some form of apology or compensation for the chewing gum on the bedsheets on the first night this was not offered and we had to explain what the problems had been we asked for a refund for the first night that we stayed and the receptionist said she was unable to offer this but would wipe the bar bill one cup of tea one cup of coffee and one croissant to compensate us this was completely unacceptable to use
