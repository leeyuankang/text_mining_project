we were on the upper levels of the hotel this time while there is a great view of the london sprawl the way that the window blinds work is not that great granted we were on the west side of the hotel and the rising sun did not affect us the setting sun was especially bright if you are in need of absolute quiet during your stay this hotel may be a bit difficult for you for some reason sounds travel and echo in the hallway slamming doors or chatting people can be heard rather easily this is from the hallway only as we did not hear through the walls for the scoring facilities was knocked as there were some renovations occurring at the time of the stay comfort was reduced because the bathroom was quite small a very tall person might have problem using the toilet
