i did not appreciate that an extra deposit was not mentionned during check in while pre authorizing the credit card i just happened to see that the amount was different to the cost of the room remembering some of the reviews on tripadvisor i asked to pay the deposit in cash which was no problem and got it back when we checked out the bathroom was very small even when you were in it alone you could barely turn around comfortable also the side of the bathroom facing the room bed has frosted glas which is not stated in the hotel s room description whoever is in the room can see what you re doing inside the bathroom which might be okay when you are travelling with your partner but not so much when travelling with a coworker not everybody wants to expose themselves when showering
