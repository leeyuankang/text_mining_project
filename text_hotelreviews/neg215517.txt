the staff were rude and incompetent on check in lied which made the whole experience unpleasant no parking on check in at around so had to look elsewhere for parking had to wait in huge que to check in full balance of hotel and a was taken as a holding deposit off my card however i wasn t told about this checked into room was given a twin room however i had booked a large double bed room in december i was then told there was no other rooms however they had disabled rooms with access which were still not what we booked i was told by the staff i had booked a disable room however when i said so why was i given a twin room they had no answer i was told by a staff member to understand that is what i had booked to which i showed him my paperwork which said large double bed then after a long wait i was given the room i had booked and the staff member was hoping for some appraisal for getting me the room which i had already booked then on check out my card was again taken and i was charged again for the room so currently my card is still on hold of not including the room charge which i wasn t even told about i phoned the hotel to ask about the holding charge and why it was being held as i hadn t been told on check in and was told that there was no booking under my name i was then asked what room after telling the lady the room all of a sudden i had stayed at the hotel with no apology whatsoever so all in all if you want a great experience pay less and youll most likely get more of a pleasant service all in all worst hotel i have ever stayed in for service
