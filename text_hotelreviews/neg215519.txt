of us booked in and could not get in our rooms until and then got woken up at from staff trying to clean the rooms we was offered free drinks and then asked to pay for them so we did to save any embarrassment overall a poor turn out and waiting for rooms messed up some of our plans for the day and missed a dinner reservation due to this
