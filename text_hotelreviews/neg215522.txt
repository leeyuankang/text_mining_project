terribly disappointing when we were made to wait hours past guaranteed check in time of despite having made room reservation months ago request was made for double bed in booking and reception told us it was when we finally received our key however it was single beds when we got to the room we had to return to lobby and wait again for the next available room with double bed i m pregnant and i definitely do not appreciate the hassle
