the room was very small much smaller than we expected looking the pictures from the hotel presentation on booking com also the bathroom was tiny no space to put the towels or personal items we had to keep them in the room the window can not be opened it is just a glass not a real window which was very unpleasant especially in the afternoon when the atmosphere became suffocating there was a big space between the entrance door and the room floor around cm so we could hear all the noise from the corridor and in the morning we were woken up by the people going to breakfast no fruits at breakfast just a fruit salad
