we were given a disabled access bedroom without being told so the bathroom was uncomfortable loo too high sink and mirror too low and a fold up chair in the shower got in the way and nowhere near as nice as we would have expected in a star london hotel when we queried this we were told that the accessible rooms are classed as a standard room and so that was what we had booked i feel sorry for people with disabilities who have to put up with a lower standard of bathroom in hotels very disappointing
