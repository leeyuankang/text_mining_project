the staff never let you feel welcomed on the day of departure we checked out and left luggages in the hotel when we came back to pick them up they couldn t find one of them it was half an hour later when they found it somewhere we were getting late for our flight but the front desk staff didn t seem concerned at all and not a single person apologized to us for this
