sadly hotel is losing its edge especially for stars this is my visit as it is near my office but events needed dealing with a within about minutes of checking in to my room a member of staff just came in using their pass card without knocking luckily no real issue and they apologized but it happened b no hot water on the first morning and no shower water at all so a wash and shave in cold water no time to fix as i needed to go to work but i reported it to the front desk c i was in a corner room near the staff access door this door clunks annoyingly every time it opens and closes along with seemingly easy sound transmission of staff conversations on weekday mornings probably not noticeable as i was going to work but not acceptable at on a saturday d whilst fetching my eggs and sausages at breakfast my coffee and apple juice were cleaned up despite leaving my key on my table if one of these had happened on its own i would not have said much but taken as a whole this makes me reluctant to rebook next time writing this before i check out so let s see what the desk staff say
