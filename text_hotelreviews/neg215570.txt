if i have to find a downside i d say breakfast though there s a lot of variety for salty and british food the sweet section is quite poor but it s fine anyway if we consider all the good sides of this hotel they are a bit slow in service during breakfast maybe there are a lot of trainees and this could be the reason it s true that breakfast room get busy during the weekend and sometimes you need to wait few minutes before get seated to your table i would recommend anyway
