room had frosted glass rather than a window which i wasn t expecting shepherd s bush may not be especially photogenic but it would be nice to see outside breakfast disappointing was asked if i wanted tea or coffee placed an order which never turned up nobody checked to see if i wanted anything to drink after the initial request no bacon at first some did turn up eventually but it was rather leathery and didn t look freshly cooked breakfast staff were arguing when i was there it looked as if a tour group had all gone to breakfast at the same time which caused the problems but if you re running a hotel you need to expect that overall not worth the price i paid
