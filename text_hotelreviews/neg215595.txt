we checked in two nights on the first night there was machinery sounds next door so i complained to front desk which it stopped then i woke up due to the sound again which i walked down to front desk to ask about this sound the staff said it was water pipe sounds due to heavy usage in the morning and couldn t be turned off as my daughter was sleeping in the room i requested to change room in the morning without interrupting my schedule of that day the staff promised they would move our bags to another room while we just need to leave the room key at front desk and go out for our planned activity the hotel should do the move by however we came back in the afternoon around there was nothing being done our packed bags were in the same room we reported and waited more than half an hour to switch to another room there were no body responsible and follow through my case which really upset me there was fire alarm rang out loud on no explanation given if this was a testing the hotel should put up notice to inform guests if this was due to other problem the hotel should follow up with announcement to clarify the situation
