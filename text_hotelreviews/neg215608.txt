room furniture was a little lacklustre room was tiny for paying this was a discount breakfast was truly appalling obviously understaffed all drinks ran out no croissants huge queue for an omelette chef under pressure we waited a long time just for a coffee and tea and when i went to wait in the queue for food and returned the coffee and tea had been taken away despite my girlfriend leaving her purse and key on the table it really was a shambles and wish i had paid a little extra for the hilton there is no excuse for running out of all juice water croissants and bread at the same time see photos i felt sorry for the f b manager but then again staff levels clearly were on the low side and inexperienced or incapable see photos not what you expect at xmas
