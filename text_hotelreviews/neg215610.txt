we arrived at new year s eve to be told our room was not ready for half an hour we were given a free drink in the bar area to the be told we had to wait another and after a drive was not the news i wanted to hear myself and my partner had no time to relax in the comfort of our room before we went out to a boat party that evening and had to rush to make sure we got ready on time we was given an extended stay in the room the following morning which was a nice gesture but still very disappointed as i paid for the night
