i was surprised by the facts the receptionist female rep i had over the phone prior to our arrival around was pretty blunt and unprofessional no name mentioned and no professional greeting less courteous we were calling in to know the possibility to check in early and even i asked for that politely given all the guests names and she was just shouting out loud when it comes to hospitality industry member of staff needs to be friendly as well as professional it was far cry from our ideal picture of the previous stays
