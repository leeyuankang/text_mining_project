we booked a standard double room and got a disabled room it was very cramped as it had a single and a double bed the shower room was really annoying as there was no shelf space to put toiletries and only one tiny towel rail i think the hotel should have taken the single bed out of the room and surely disabled people need shelf space and towel rails too we mentioned this to the reception staff member who was not at all interested
