worst smelling hotel i have ever been something happened at night december at third floor right side from elevator and this smelled i am sorry like pampers with diarrhea or worse and a lot stronger and hotel have no outer windows to open it and get some air and this smell was during all of my stay december i asked cleaning staff what happened here but they were like what we smell nothing while i have seen that closest to elevator rooms has put a boot at their doorway to make some ventilate and hotel is not cheap i must say to have such experience
