this is time in a row i have been given a room adapted for wheelchair users lowered bed is fine lowered toilet with potty seat whb bath is not last visit the shower was fixed to wall at the height to suit someone sitting rather than my husband of astonishing deflection from staff that this was to give us more room that this was a standard room and we should say if we don t want disabled facilities that when hotel full the cheaper rooms are allocated this way i left with no confidence at all that the hotel would overhaul its room allocation policy so much for encouraging loyal customers to return
