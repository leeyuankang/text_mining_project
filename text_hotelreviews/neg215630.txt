we arrived hours after check in time and our room was still not ready we d actually asked for an early check in before we were delayed the spa is advertised as having sauna steam room and a room to relax in free to all guests when we went up there we were sent back to our room to phone reception and order bathrobes to come back up to the spa in we were made to feel awkward that we didn t have any treatments booked and were just using the heat experience and also told there was no relaxation room for us to use after coming out the sauna we ordered cod cheeks tempura and got served fillets of battered cod when they took it back to replace it for the right meal they brought back smaller fillets of cod in batter with bones they should have just said there were no cod cheeks left check out took about minutes
