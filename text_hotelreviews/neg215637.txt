this is the second time i have been offered a room for the disabled on the first occasion we arrived early enough to change the room this time i arrived fairly late on my own and had to get up at so did not want the hassle of changing rooms if my wife had been with me we would have not accepted the room as fit for purpose a number of features are too low for the able bodied and there was a smell coming from the drains after a shower this decreased and was fairly clear by morning could management please review this strategy as there is a very acceptable alternative nearby room
