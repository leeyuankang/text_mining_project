despite having a confirmed booking for a double room i was checked into a twin then deposit had already been charged and it was early evening as i had indicated my arrival time so i wasn t a no show yet when i went down to ask to change to the room type i had booked the front desk staff were reluctant to give it to me the sheepish response rather than an apology for a mistake suggested that this was deliberate strategy to re sell the double room just because i booked at a discount through this website doesn t mean they can substitute an inferior room and not honour the advertised room and rate i did get the room type i wanted but beware if this happens to you and complain
