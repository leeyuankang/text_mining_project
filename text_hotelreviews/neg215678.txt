restaurant seems to be a bit under sized for the hotel capacity so i had to wait in a queue to get seated only very basic choice of cold meals choice of warm meals is sufficiently rich my room windows were oriented toward the seating area in the bar below so i had to keep the curtains closed at all times somehow claustrophobic
