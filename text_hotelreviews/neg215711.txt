the hotel has a contract with a single car service firm and staff are not allowed to make bookings with any of the several excellent minicab firms in the area there were few starchy foods available at breakfast and granola rather than muesli not good for me as a diabetic the one time i ate in the restaurant in the evening service started good but there were often no visible staff as i ended my meal and i had to wait several minutes to get my bill
