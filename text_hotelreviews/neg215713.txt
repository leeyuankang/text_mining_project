i had a superior double room and was surprised to be allocated one with no natural light and no easy sitting furniture there was one desk chair despite the room having acres of empty space beware room allocation as it is the same price to have a room with outside light and sofa provided the bathroom was bizarre a huge shower wet room concept with a microscopic washbasin and really cheap poor tap and absolutely zero shelf space so nowhere to put your soap bar shampoo conditioner etc etc whilst in the shower other than on the floor there was so little no shelf space that even the flat space on the wc pan was used for the complementary toothbrush and toilet tissues so i ended up having to keep shaving kit and other stuff in the bedroom and sort of carry them in in stages when needed in the bathroom its a shame because in many respects its a good quality room experience and very good value for money but it is poor practice to show photos that bear no relation to the actual rooms also if you have a mixture of rooms with external natural light and others opening only onto an artificially lit atrium then you should say so
