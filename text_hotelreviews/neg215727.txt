breakfast was chaotic the food was bland but on the plus side you could have as much bland food as you liked there was a que of people waiting to be seated which was included in the a night room you would be better opting for room only and going over to the mc donald s there bland breakfast is only parking was a pain it was a minute walk with heavy bags i m not used to london hotels so perhaps this is normal having moaned i would stay again but with no breakfast and i d pay for the valet parking
