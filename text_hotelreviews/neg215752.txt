our hotel room was fitted with disabled facilities was located right opposite the elevator which resulted in highened noise levels outside our door the chair installed in the shower left it impractical to use the bathroom had no shelf room for toiletries there was also a damp musky smell coming from the bathroom for the duration of our stay which wasn t nice
