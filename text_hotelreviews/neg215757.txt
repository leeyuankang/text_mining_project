on arrival there was an issue with car parking which rather ruffled my feathers and to be honest it was not all the hotels issue however this hotel was very prompt to send a manager to me and listen too my concerns and reassured me and did everything possible to make my stay a perfect weekend so let me reassure you all if you where to be unhappy be assured that you should politely let it be known and they will do anything humanly possible to assist your concerns
