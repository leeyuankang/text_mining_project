if you don t like birds then beware each bedroom door has a bird next to the number the lovely toiletries holder has a bird as its handle i loved it but have friends who hate birds sunday morning breakfast was a disaster long queue and i counted empty dirty tables with not staff member to be seen to clear these once i was seated i was not offered tea or coffee there were no bowls for cereal juice had run out as had eggs bacon and some of the pastries eggs appeared halfway through my breakfast but were cold i appreciate i arrived at an extremely busy time on a sunday morning but staff seemed too laid back and were in no rush to replenish items with the exception of one male server who seemed to be trying to do everything a server appeared to the table next to me offering coffee and i had to gain her attention for service
