our room wasn t ready when we arrived so we were given an alternative which had disabled facilities as a result the bathroom was poor a tiny sink low shower with poor pressure and it smelled damp the breakfast was chaotic nothing was available except in dribs and drabs so we ended up waiting for ages the staff were completely overwhelmed and the restaurant was a mess very disappointing for such an elevated price
