the room their was no mini bar in the room not even a bottle of water only one bath sheet each asked for s second one next day it didn t happen the breakfast first day staff very miserable my husband and i asked for a double expresso it did eventually come but it seemed a problem their was no cossoints on buffet table do we asked for some and we were told their was none left no cheese left either no apple juice the scrambled egg was sloppy and runny and just a total disappointment the second day was a little better even though hot drinks machine wasn t working the food was much more acceptable but staff still very miserable and un pleasant bar area staff rather un attentive we waited mins for someone to come over and ask us if we wanted anything took another ten mins to make two drinks staff too busy talking amongst themselves i think you should also think of selling or providing other snacks with drinks rather than salted popcorn not everyone likes popcorn we also had coffee in lounge on second day which arrived lovely and hot with out cream which then took another minutes to come we wanted a scone with out coffee when it artived it was just a scone no cream preserve butter so i had to ask for that too thank goodness it was only two nights the attentiveness just was not their at all which i expect when i go to a hotel the best bit was the departure lady on reception was lovely our luggage was brought to car and the concierge on departure who was called abdel was the most pleasant and helpful we won t ever return again and i certainly will not recommend either a big shame as it is a nice product
