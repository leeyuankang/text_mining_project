we were put in a disabled room without actually being disabled so the bathroom was uncomfortable my husband had to pee standing up and kneel over the basin as it was at knee height there was no shelf to put toiletries on for the shower or the basin we had to throw the soap back into the basin or on the floor as it was a wet room shower but with curtains i went to reception to query the room and was told with some disdain we had booked late and we had only asked for a standard room so couldn t expect anything more a pity about that as it would have been enjoyable otherwise nice to have been told before at the time of booking or at check in instead of the surprise
