the staff was unhelpful and careless we arrived at the hotel just before midnight we booked the hotel because we went to a concert nearby and thought that it would be easier to stay close to work than drive back home we arrived hungry wet it was raining a lot and tired while my partner went to look for a car parking as the hotel didn t have any car parking space left i checked in and went to the room i arrived at the bedroom and realised that they gave us a disable room which wasn t so bad but not attractive before i heading to a shower i ordered some food pizza and a salad which was around and the person who took our order mentioned that the food would be with us in minutes after ordering the dinner i went to have a shower and for my disappointment and frustration the water wasn t warm enough and the shower was weak and the thermostat was broken i finish my shower and was still feeling cold and annoyed as i expected to have a warm and relaxing shower before go to bed so i asked the reception if they could move us to another room where the shower worked so at least my partner could have a warm shower so after minutes the manager arrived in the room to check if he could fix the shower as they didn t want to give us another room after or so waiting they decided to move us as they couldn t fix the shower when we were moving to the new room we asked the manager if the kitchen was aware of the change of rooms and his answers was yes we waited and waited for the food and nothing i called the reception to complain and check where the food was a few times the food arrived and cold by that time we received the food we were annoyed and tired so we called reception again and told them that the food was cold nothing was done by the hotel manager so we ended up not eating the cold pizza and the salad never arrived they said they didn t have any salad left
