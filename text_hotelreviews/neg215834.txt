we booked two rooms but the receptionist couldn t find our booking which caused a bit of stress checking in she could have been more personable too as she came across a little abrupt clueless windows wouldn t open when it was extremely hot room smelt of food when we arrived also had to get the maintenance man out after having a shower as the drain was blocked flooded the bathroom floor to be fair though he arrived quickly and sorted it out also would have liked to have seen the hotel bar open later
