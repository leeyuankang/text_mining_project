whilst super close to westfield the hotel was quite far from the tube station and whilst still in zone one it is not that central although i understand that upon my arrival it was rainy season the windows in my room were very dirty and were overlooking the hotel itself which gave the room quite a gloomy lighting and one may find this bothersome otherwise the room itself was very clean
