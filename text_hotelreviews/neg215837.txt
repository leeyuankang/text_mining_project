concierge service very week it took them about minutes till they took small pieces from me as i wanted to keep in the hotel for few hours but mostly i was upset because they kept us in a back room for the breakfast with no body serving us at all even that they were not busy nor the front hall was busy but since we were they did not want to join a table for us also replacing empty dishes with new dishes is slow you have to wait till you ask and they go and fill back
