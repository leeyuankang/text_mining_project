breakfast but it was mostly full and you had to wait until a table was empty also i was booked into a double room deluxe double room it would have been very uncomfortable for persons to share especially the bathroom toilet not enough space to swing a cat car parking it s impossible to park your car in this area so you are forced to use the hotels parking service which at gbp per day i found very expensive coming back to my deluxe room a room with a view if you like that looking out off your rooms window into someone s backyard and seeing them hanging out the washing not impressed
