upon arrival we were greeted by sylvia at the reception desk who did not seem pleased to serve us she didn t tell us anything like how you need to use the room card to work the lift or even what direction the lifts were in her face was so unhappy i didn t want to stand there talking to her anyway the description of our room included an iron and ironing board though this was not there everything else was as described
