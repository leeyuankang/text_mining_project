the lady who checked us in was very unhelpful she did not tell us how to get to the lifts or that you needed a card to operate it she just moaned about people checking in from booking com during our stay the fire alarm went off and it was pure confusion the fire exit was blocked with a barrier and builders material some men had to move it the staff were unhelpful they did not even know where the stairs were the only time they gave us any attention is when i started to film the incident unfortunately this upset them causing one member to swear at me the positive was that it was a false alarm and no one was hurt we also ordered room service but only half the meal came the lady who took the order said she forgot i was not cross as this can happen we were only charged for what we had
