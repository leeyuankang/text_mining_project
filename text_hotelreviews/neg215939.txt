when we arrived we were asked if we would like to upgrade our room to a larger room at a charge and we agreed however the room was small and freezing we complained numerous times and each time an engineer came to look but it was a waste of time in ten end they brought us a little oil heater that had the room too hot then when it was off it was too cold this not getting a good nights sleep the breakfast the next morning also was a let down the food was cold it s buffet style but there doesn t seem to be any way they keep the food hot
