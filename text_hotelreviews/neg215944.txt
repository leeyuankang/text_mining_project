constant hum from air conditioning all night maybe due to being on top floor of hotel and air con equipment on roof maybe ask for room lower down in building also extra loud fan in room bathroom but this can be turned off by pressing button on digital screen near front door keep pressing button on left side until it says fan off a simple instruction on wall beside control would be helpful for non technically minded guests cannot open windows air con is on all the time advice to everybody bring a few bottles of water from local shops to drink throughout your time in room as air con will dry out your mouth throat especially at night i noticed other guests with water bottles coming up in lift they realised same problem bad smell from shower waste when first entering room but it goes away after using shower maybe run shower for few minutes and pour some shampoo in shower to cancel the smell probably due to shower not been used for few days before i went into room light under door from corridor at night but same in lots of hotels just put a towel on floor in front of door to block out light
