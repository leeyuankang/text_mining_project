service was incredibly slow on the first night we ate in the restaurant with family and the waiting staff contradicted each other with menu options to have a service charge added to the bill seemed very steep but it is my own fault that i did not query this the second day we went to order cocktails at the bar and were told the waiter would come to us there was no one else waiting to be served but the waiter had not made it to us after minutes so we left the heating system in the room rattled so loudly it had to be turned off at night
