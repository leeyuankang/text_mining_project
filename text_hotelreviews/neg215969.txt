no drinking water in the room or soap to wash hands room is quite small staff were very rude and unwelcoming there was no one to help me with my bags and i was rudely told to take them myself the window view is to the inside of the hotel so depressing as no sunlight gets in the room i certainly believe that stars is a huge over rating for this hotel
