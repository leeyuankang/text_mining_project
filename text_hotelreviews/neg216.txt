its hard to get back to the hotel later at night since the tram is off after around midnight and walking after going out in the other end of the city can be tiring but we managed anyway this is not a big issue unless you really prefer to be in the center rather than in a beautiful quiet hotel as this one not enough soap in the room restaurant bar snacks are very expensive also i would ve appreciated being told that there is construction going on before the booking although this was again a non issue except for the small visual inconvenience in the entrance no noise or dirt at all
