first they allocated us to a twin room when we asked for the double we had booked they said they could zip the beds together we didn t want this so the only actual double mattress they had was in an accessible room which was ok but the shower and toilet weren t ideal as a result as i was leaving in the morning my way out was blocked because they had rented out the lobby to film an advert they showed me an alternative way out but i was in a hurry and the delay was annoying
