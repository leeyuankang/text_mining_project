terribly uncomfortable pillows staff very condescending probably because we have a casual look this treatment is totally unacceptable at the prices we were paying no breakfast included at this price is ridiculous this is normally a standard we were told our room was upgraded to an executive suite but we were given a room with a couch in the bedroom if that is an executive suite the standard rooms must be unacceptably tiny any other executive suites we have stayed in would normally have a separate living room and bedroom
