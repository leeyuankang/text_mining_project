very little space in the room bathroom was tiny was unable to enter bathroom after having a shower due to wet room style shower which caused the floor to be very wet for a number of hours after air conditioning unit made screeching noises when turned off or low fan and humming noise was constant when turned on also if temperature was set at less than the unit was extremely noisy had to walk sideways to get from one side of room to the opposite side due to the position of the bed being so close to the end wall of the room
