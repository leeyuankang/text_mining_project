the first room we were put in was in the basement it was awful so they put us on floor the room was so small a double bed was squeezed in there and the bathroom was tiny it was not clean the bed base had dirty marks on it and the room was so hot there was a fan but it was very noisy so you could not have it on at night we had a lovely view of the grenfell tower the breakfast was just awful and the staff serving were lazy and gossiping with their friends there was rubbish on the floor the whole time we were sat there and they just walked over it i paid cash on arrival and when i checked out the next morning they said i hadn t paid the manager came out and informed them that i had paid and showed him the cash in the draw do not stay here its awful
