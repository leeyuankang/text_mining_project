i would never have booked this hotel if i had known they were going to give me a room sad excuse for a room in the basement next to the breakfast area lots of noise luckily i got another room for the second and third night the hotel was very noisy at all times as if the staff just did not want you to sleep because they wanted to start cleaning the rooms poor quality rooms falling apart expensive for what it was not coming back
