although the room was clean and functional it was very small and with no air conditioning in the heat of the summer it was stifling to the point of being uncomfortable and difficult to sleep which is not what you want when you are out all day sightseeing etc it is a shame because the staff the location and the cleanliness of the place were all brilliant i would recommend the hotel because of all the positive attributes but on the proviso that a good sized room was requested
