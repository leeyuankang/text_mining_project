there was no ac in the room so it was hot even though there was a fan it was a bit awkward to open the window as it opened out into the courtyard sitting area the shuttle booked by the hotel was hours late in picking us up from the airport the hotel was good with following up with this but i will not recommend the shuttle service i would recommend getting the gatwick express from the airport to victoria station and a taxi to the hotel about or the tube to bayswater then a short walk to the hotel
