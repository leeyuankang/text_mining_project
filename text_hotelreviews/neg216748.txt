very nice room but room really should have been a single room the double bed was pushed against the wall and there was hardly any room for people to move sitting on bed was only option window opened but would not stay up and as hot evening had to put room cushions to stop it closing shower head is very high up in the shower and for anyone around high little bit difficult if you did not want to get your hair wet lovely breakfast and good choice nice strong coffee but spoilt a bit by staff member just stood at door chewing gum and did not welcome us into breakfast room with a good morning other guests were standing later as no tables left but staff did not seem to care and just said you will have to wait to them no apologies or offer to try and rectify with extra chairs or offer lounge area upstairs to eat their breakfast in
