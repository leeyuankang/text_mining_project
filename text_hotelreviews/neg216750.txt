the room we stopped in must surely be the smallest room we have ever encountered during our world wide travel the bed was pushed into the end of the l shaped room making it only accessible from one side storage was pitiful only one very small single wardrobe and two people were unable to pass side by side in the only available space at the side of the bed the bathroom although very clean was so small you couldn t swing a bat in it and no shower screen the whole bathroom was awash every time the shower was used the towel rail was hung off the wall and the bathroom handle came off in my wife s hand so all in all with the high cost of the room we will never ever return
