the shower had quite a high step into it and didn t feel that safe especially when getting out when wet there was no handle or anything to hold on to also the waiting staff in the restaurant didn t even acknowledge us in the morning i had to ask where can we sit and do we help ourselves never had that in any restaurant before otherwise i would have given the hotel a better rating overall
