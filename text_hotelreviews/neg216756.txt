would have preferred hotel to have spent money on sound proofing than the phone type gizmo in room minimal sleep due to dripping tap from upstairs very clear and loud snoring from next door as if no wall there at all generator from along the corridor and the slamming of doors early in the morning my basement room was cold and tiny no desk or space to work but well appointed breakfast was functional due to the noise i ll happily sacrifice some of the aesthetic touches for the opportunity of a better nights sleep
