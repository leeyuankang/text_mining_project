i have stayed there nights on the night i have arrived at as advised and i was given a room in the basement next to the housekeepers storage room and the luggage room the window was facing the hallway with the luggage room so we had to keep the blinds shut all the time the room itself it s really really small could barely squeeze to medium size luggages at am the housekeepers came to work and we woke up as they were making a lot of noise probably they haven t realised the room was occupied at someone dropped a luggage at around someone smashed a plate the breakfast room was few stepd away everytime someone used the lift there was a terrible noise as the lift room was next to the storage room so for the night we hadn t had a good sleep i have asked the receptionist at the arrival for a different room as i didn t wanted to stay in the basement but he advised that he has no power to do that and i should ask the receptionist that will come in the morning maybe he was there just to guard the hotel in the morning i have asked the receptionist for a different room as anyway everyone in the hotel was leaving they gave me the attic room which was even smaller it was not properly ventilated and it became really hot really soon they gave me a double bed although i have specified that i want a twin room i found the staff really unprofessional and unhappy i always said hello and goodbye and got some odd answers in return the ladies at breakfast seemed unhappy as well and in all my mornings spent there i haven t seen them once smile i would not use the hotel again because of how incredibly small are the rooms stayed in london a lot of times and never had a room this small and because of the unfriendly staff
