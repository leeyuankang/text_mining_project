first of all the room is very small there was hardly place for a bed and the bathroom was very small as well thereby it didn t look like the pictures on the site furthermore the included breakfast is poor as well we expected at least a basic english breakfast but even that was not the case also the room was quite noisy and the friendliness of the staff decreased when the night falls overall the value for money is very poor for this price one may expect a lot better
