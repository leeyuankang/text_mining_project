the room was much smaller than i expected considering the price the bed was crammed into the corner of the room no a c the breakfast wasn t good i had in fact paid for breakfast to be included but the tea was from a big boiler and when i saw the limited selection of options in terms of cereal and the poor quality of baked goods croissants i left and got my own breakfast down the road
