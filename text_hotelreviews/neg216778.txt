the room has been behind the reception extremly small and very noisy and located on the ground floor with window to the backyard where people have been sitting and smoking when we arrived we had to wait minutes because the receptionist was on his break the breakfast was kind of normal nothing really special i really cannot understand why the hotel is rated so highly
