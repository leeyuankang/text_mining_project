we had book a triple room but it was not the third bed was sort of sofa turned into a bed long and not comfy at all the r ception lady said we could have another room but it was such a tiny one and the third bed was not like the two others either so we kept the first room it was next to the levator so we had the noise of it going up and down all the time and the noise of people talking in front of our doir while waiting for the lift the breakfast room in the bassement is just unbelievable for a four star hotel no decoration too small to host all the clients an uggly basement room and very cheap breakfast only the croissant were all right the two rooms i saw did not look like the bedrooms on the picture at all it s smaller and not pretty at all definitly not a four star hotel the safe didn t work i would not recommend this hotel
