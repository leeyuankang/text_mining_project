the bathroom needs upgrading a shower curtain would prevent the floods in bathroom especially as the showerhead is attached to the wall and it is impossible to turn it so that one would not flood the floor toiletbrush would be a very welcoming accessory as well equally there is horrible chlore smell coming from the bathroom not sure the hotel itself could fix this issue but it did smell rather unpleasantly the smell from bathroom and the fact that either the room was distantly heated heating body in room was cold or isolated to prevent any oxygen flow we had the window open for the entire stay to have some fresh air and to be able to sleep over night without the possibility to open the window it would have been a disaster smelly and way too warm lastly and i really do not want to be a nag but one can hear neighbours too well luckily we didn t have side neighbours but we could hear every move of our upstairs neighbours and when walking in the corridor one could hear every word from all the rooms when passing by not really pleasant to overhear and not pleasant knowing that others can hear
