continental breakfast in the morning there s nothing better than a fresh pot of tea coffee brought to your table by the staff the tea and coffee was self service and in flasks which meant it was over brewed not appealing at all the tea in the room was of poor quality this is a pity as the accommodation was very good and value for money
