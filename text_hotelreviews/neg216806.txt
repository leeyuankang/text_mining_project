sleepless night before we got another room very noisy one can hear guests on the floor above when they snore take shower walk etc i wanted to leave the hotel after night tiny room twin after we put bags into the room we couldnt walk in the room anymore basic breakfast breakfast room looked like in a hostel not a stars hotel low quality food door to kitchen were open all the times when i asked to close as i was seating next to the kitchen they disagreeed so i spent breakfast in aromas of washing liquid and noise of dishes being washed staff not really helpful when asked to complete towels missing in our bathroom they ignored it unsecure space to leave thebaggage and you have to carry it yourself as a whole compensation for a sleepless night we got chocolate two stars would be my most rating i dont recomend this hotel conparing to other star boutique hotels i gave been to this is really much below the expected quality
