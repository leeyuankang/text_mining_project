the toilet did not flush properly hot water ran out in the morning we could hear everything from the couple above us and they would arrive every night at and loudly talk and bang things till am which meant we were forced to complain to the reception and they said they would try to solve it nothing happened to solve it the breakfast we paid for consisted of croissants that were gross and the yogurt that was sick so we never had breakfast at the hotel again
