we stayed there twice before and found top floor room was worse than lower floor rooms which had big windows and good view to the square top floor room had ceiling you had to bend your neck to walk under that s when you wanted to get to one side of the bed tiny bathroom with tiny sink other than that good hotel would stay there again but not on top floor
