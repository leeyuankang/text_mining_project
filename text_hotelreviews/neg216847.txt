the bathroom needs a shower curtain it is an open shower meaning water splashes all over and i am of average figure the entire facility especially the bathroom as such isn t suited if you re of a large size meaning plus waist size the room is very compact so if you re claustrophobic definitely avoid or book a larger room with more than one standard sized window but still who likes wet bathroom floors and wet toilet seats get a curtain dear new linden it doesn t cost that much
