i requested a quite room on a high floor all the suites were located on the first ground floor which is okay but although the room was big the view was not nice i had the window blinds down all the time because i didn t feel comfortable with the possibility of people in the courtyard being able to see straight into my room the first night there also was a terrible noise like a giant vacuum cleaner luckily i was so tired after my trip managed to fall asleep anyway however this was just the first night i also find it odd that in a hotel no one showed me to my room and when i got to store my luggage after checkout the last day i had to take it to the storage room by myself i just got the key and directions to where to put it that felt really strange
