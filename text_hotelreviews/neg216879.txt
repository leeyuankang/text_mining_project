the breakfast was basic and the breakfast room was too small for the amount of guests staying in the hotel we were always waiting for a table to become available and we weren t the only ones the hotel is in need of updating the front desk staff were polite but some of the other staff treated us like we were in their way just by staying there the lift is very slow and is often used by staff doing housekeeping the tv in the room was very small and had a fault the hotel had advertised that it was in chelsea it s actual location is between bayswater and notting hill gate
