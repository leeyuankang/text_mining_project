its not a good idea to phrase this as what could have been better because frankly there is no room to make this better but the rooms are very very small i mean really small with barely room to put your computer anywhere and try to work the bed usually takes up almost the entire room so it is difficult to know where to put things i like it that the new linden has made the most of what they have and after all this is london not ottawa so not much space but still my niece who has yet to stay in a hotel in london even though she works in this city couldn t believe that i was paying what i was paying for the tiny room but in all honestly it was a very good price for london what can i say
