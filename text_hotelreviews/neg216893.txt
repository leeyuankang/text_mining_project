as room was in the basement i had no phone or mobile internet reception the wifi was patchy and the tv signal was poor at times there were cobwebs on the ceiling and dust around the room the shower had no grab rails and as the shower was up some steps it was a bit dangerous also after returning back late in the evening i found that the cleaner hadn t locked the room door thankfully nothing was taken but not impressed also a lot of noise with doors banging at all hours not a restful night sleep
