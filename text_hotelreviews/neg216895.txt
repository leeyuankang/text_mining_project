basement room nr you could hear the elevator machinery all the time consider breakfast room is located on this floor so very big traffic of people from onwards door of the room was not perfectly fitting so it made noise slamming all the time people would open and close outer doors breakfast is ok but depending on the time you might need to wait for some minutes before you get a seat we were lucky and did not wait any morning
