the age of the hotel building and the design of the rooms each en suite has been added after the fact means that the rooms are very small and when i say small i mean small there is literally no room around a double bed and at best a passage width between the remaining side of the bed and the next wall the bathrooms are also small don t expect a shelf on which to put your toiletries if you are only going to use the hotel as a place to sleep and nothing else then it is manageable for short stays
