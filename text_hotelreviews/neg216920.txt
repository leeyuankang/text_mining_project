i was in room in the basement there was no possibility of achieving a good nights sleep as machinery and plant in the basement area prevented that from happening to the point that i would say the room could not be reasonably used as a bedroom i advised the receptionist when i was checking out that the noise in the basement was unbearable and she said that if i stayed there in the future i should ask for a room on the upper levels hotels shouldn t put people in these rooms if they know that they are problematic had this have happened in a premier inn i would have received a full refund
