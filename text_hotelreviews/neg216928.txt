our room was small with a set of five steps off a small landing going down to the rest of the room there was nowhere to put our luggage and the bathroom was like a closet my husband has a bad hip which made things very difficult the staff in the breakfast room were very abrupt and started removing everything the minute came a mother was three children was told she was too late when she arrived just on we had stayed in this hotel five years ago and although it was tired we had a much better room the price we payed for this hotel was ridiculous for what we received i am normally a very positive reviewer but we would never stay here again
