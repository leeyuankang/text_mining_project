where do i start this hotel is definitely not more like rooms were tiny no bar no iron in the room and when i asked for one i was asked to collect it from reception as the staff didn t start work till approx no option for english breakfast and to top it off you could not eat in the rooms due to the expensive furnishings which i would say is questionable
