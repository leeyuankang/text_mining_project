we went to london during a particularly hot week and had an attic room it was boiling day and night even with the windows open to add to this there was only warm hot water coming out of the taps in the bathroom so that we couldn t even have a cold shower to cool off the room was very tidy but for me the attention to detail was missing there were little things that put me off e g broken light fittings broken loo roll holder no glasses in bathroom to store your toothbrushes and ripped towels the staff at breakfast were very loud speaking amongst themselves but wouldn t greet the guests
