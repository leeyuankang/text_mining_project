i was offered a genius luxury offer and i spent three nights in a double room i must report that this is far from being a hotel as many things for improving must be done except for the very small rooms most of them are very small but as usual in london curtains for showers are missing thus making the tiny toilet a lake every time there are no minirefrigerators in the rooms expected in any no air conditioning thus making the room a hell after dusk the breakfast is very standard and unsatisfactory
