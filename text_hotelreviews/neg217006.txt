very dissapointed with this hotel actually the bed was very poor and had wheels underneath it moved about during the night and that s pretty dangerous in my opinion i woke up one morning and the bed had moved from the wall with my head hanging at the edge all because the bed was not secure also the quality of the mattress was poor secondly the floor was not very stable i felt like i was going to fall through the floor i know it sounds stupid but these things are important when stopping in a hotel of a standard like this star no way is this up to the srandard of a star in terms of health and safety this hotel is a little risky and i wouldn t recommend it to anyone
