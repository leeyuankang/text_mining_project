rooms are ridiculously small our bed was not even long enough for me i m only tall and you could only enter from one side it s nearly impossible to shower without flooding the bathroom the walls are so thin you can hear every word said outside of the room or even in rooms nearby and every door slammed every person walking past making it nearly impossible to sleep it didn t help that cleaning starts at and staff knock on your door at on a sunday asking to clean the room breakfast only has a very limited choice ham is cut into thick pieces nothing warm except hard boiled eggs when in the uk i would ve loved a british breakfast with baked beans and bacon but i guess for the price it s just not what you get
