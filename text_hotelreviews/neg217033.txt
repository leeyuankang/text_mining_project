the double bed consisted of two beds pushed together which slid apart the whole night the room was cold and tiny and the shower had no curtain so the bathroom became soaked when one tried to have a shower it was also a lovely day and we weren t allowed out onto the balcony because they were re oiling the decking only good points were that staff were friendly and breakfast was included
