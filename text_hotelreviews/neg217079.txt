the room was poorly ventilated and warm and the shower was so small the whole bathroom turned into a wet mess when taking a shower very slippery and dangerous i found this very dissapointing when i called the reception about this i got the answer yes we know this happens well this is how the building is structured not customer friendly if you ask me also the breakfast was too basic for a star hotel
