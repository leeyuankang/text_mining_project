we booked a double but what we got instead was two single beds pushed together there were no fastenings on the bed s base so they moved a lot which created a large gap in the middle in our opinion the room was far too small to even be used as a double anyway and technically with two singles pushed badly together it was not the double room we thought we were getting or what we paid for the shower had no curtain or door and so water just flooded the entire floor which meant the mat was continusously sopping wet
