we have booked for nights when we arrive around they have gave us a room which was floor under the heating was not working as also the tv when we told them about the problems the receptionist who was in the afternoon shift has replied that he will take care of it when we came back after hours nothing was working too when i call the reception again the afternoon shift had left and the night shift came and fix the problems the only point which measure to my opinion to rate the hotel with a better rate than zero was this guy who was very helpful after our complaints they moved us to a higher level floor next day but a very smaller room thank god next day we left early in the morning the fotos in booking com are not even close to the reality
