the room we got was sooo tiny standard double room literally have only bed and some space to move between the window and bathroom i though people were exaggerating here but they are not beds are on the wheels if you are small it will not affect you but if you weight the bed will move every time you turn around the shower is also very small i struggled to move there and i am tiny person the standard rooms are nothing like on the pictures we felt claustrophobic in the room and you cannot call it never met as small rooms and i travel a lot the balcony was nice however we shared it with our neighbours and because we had table and chairs in front of our window they just sat there making us feel really uncomfortable no privacy to be truthful i expected much more for that price and from the hotel that is classified as luckily we were staying there only nights in other case we would have gone to another hotel as for this price i am sure we could get a room in some hotels and the standard of the rooms would ve been higher and we wouldn t feel like caged animals overall very average for standard double room
