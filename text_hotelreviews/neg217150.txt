hotel rooms are very small we booked a luxury suite but it was right next to the reception with look from the street we were moved the day after but the room was very small they told us that it was a luxury suite our big boys had room in the basement next to the restaurant standard room not nice forget about eating breakfast at the hotel the staff is acidic when asking about something and there is not much choice the restaurant is also in the basement the fine roof terrace with wicker furniture as seen from booking com site exists but is not particularly cozy
