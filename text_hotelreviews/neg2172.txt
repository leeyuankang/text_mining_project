hard to find a single plug socket easy in room wood effect on walls made the room feel small and enclosed heating didn t seem to work well was but didn t feel even maybe because room on ground floor and draft coming through the windows didn t see the point of little entrance before getting in room especially there being no plug socket in there very disappointing
