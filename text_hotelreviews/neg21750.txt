hotel pool should stay open later there is no staff there and it is in the basement so it does not bother anyone and should not bother anyone if they let it stay open an hour longer so guests can relax it closes at but its hard to find a restaurant in paris that opens before so it ended up always being do we eat or swim it would be really nice if it was open until also the pool water was not warm enough
