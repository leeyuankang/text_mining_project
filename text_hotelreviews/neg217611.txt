what lets this hotel down is the food when we arrived at about and ordered a simple vegetarian pizza from the room service menu we were told that they had run out of them afterwards when we came down to their terrace area and wanted a table we were told that all the tables had been reserved and the bar was occupied with a private party so we should go find ourselves a local caf when we ordered breakfast in the room the next morning the bowl of cereal had no spoon the basket of bread came with no plate and the cup of decaf coffee was ice cold
