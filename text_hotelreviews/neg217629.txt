totally over priced this is not a hotel more like breakfast was not good and very little choice in comparison to ther hotels quite offy receptionist offered a very cramped low celing room with view of roof tops on an email we had asked for a room with a view and very quiet only offered interior room as an alternative or one on the first floor which was noisy or an up grade costing hundreds more having asked for a quiet room and accepted the first floor room we were woken up at with drilling outside the room and a crane with workman looking into our room the room actually shook we had also seen a mouse in the hotel the night before after complaining we were given a very nice interior room although this was specifically what we had not wanted but the room was comfortable and good quality and was quiet on paying the bill they had deducted only off the bill we had been awake with the noise from as the trucks started to arrive and had spent many hours the next day negotiating moving etc after complaining this was not a sufficient deduction we were offered a special rate on our next visit and an up grade we would not return then offered deduction on the first night only and then some more whilst i accept the work outside was not in the hotel the building work had been going on for several months and we had not been informed espcially annoying as we had requested quiet the manager said they did not get clients email addresses when booking through booking com whilst this is otherwise a comfortable hotel in an excellent location it is very over priced for what it is and the hotel should inform clients of extensive building work going on outside before they arrive
