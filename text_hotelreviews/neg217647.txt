i booked this hotel in advance and paid in advance as a special treat for the new year s eve period for my wife who has recently recovered from cancer post the terrorism events in paris and the heightened security concerns across europe me and my wife decided to change our plans and not travel to europe during this period we contacted the hotel and presented our case yet was told that we will not be granted a refund for the that we paid for two nights because they said as far as they are concern life goes on and their are no security concerns in paris we was very offended and the hotel made no efforts to assist us and stuck to their policy despite this being a peak period and they could very easily have rebooked our rooms now we have two night paid and we have lost our money for such a prestigious hotel i am deeply upset at how they have treated us we spent along time to choose the right hotel and paid a premium and now we have lost everything
