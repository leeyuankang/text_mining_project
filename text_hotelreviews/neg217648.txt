no breakfast included with booking made online we paid for our breakfast but i think there should have been a bigger selection for the buffet considering the price paid i felt our junior suite was a bit too cozy as i was expecting a more spacious room the baudelaire did not live up to our expectations but possibly because there was a large function at the hotel so our food was compromised the staff also looked very busy
