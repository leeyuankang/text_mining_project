all in all the negatives were down to the timing of our visit building site right next door and so very noisy early morning there was filming going on during the day which interfered with customer access so not exactly customer focused maybe a bit of planning to avoid key times in the day would have been sensible concierge services could be a bit more proactive mini bar should have had wine in it not just a small sparkling wine
