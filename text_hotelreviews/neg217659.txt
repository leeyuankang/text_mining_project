we have stayed here before and enjoyed our stay however in this occasion there were noisy deliveries and building works through the night the staff neglected to inform us of swimming pool closure throughout our stay and the did not even have the common courtesy to offer any kind of rate reduction staff are dishonest and it is a shame but i will not stay there again a little apology and a discount would have sufficed
