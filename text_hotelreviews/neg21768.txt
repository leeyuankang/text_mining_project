the minibar is very expensive euros for a cola also the room cleaning isn t very good we didn t get clean towels one day and no more coffee although we had left euros for the cleaning staff also they reserve an amount of euros extra on your creditcard for extras the wifi is very bad doesn t work in the evening i think because a lot of gueste are using it at night
