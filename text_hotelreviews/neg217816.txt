i reserved a special parking place by exception in front of the hotel because of my special car although the morning of my arrival this place was confirmed at arrival there was no place reason the cars of staff members and the chef are parked in front of the hotel in my understanding they should park their cars somewhere else and create parking space and also leave a proper space for arriving and departing guests to park their cars for a moment properly in this narrow street this has to do with a certain service level no luggage assistance at departure no five star service in the room changing towels at the end of the day opening the beds preparing the room for the night
