the people in the room across from ours were so loud i could hear everything l phone calls conversations to the extent that i actually had to knock on their door am to shush them not surprisingly the reception apologized in the morning and informed us that those guestd were asked to check out the following morning because the reception received several complaints so while this is not the hotel s fault it might be worth noting that within the hotel itself noise can be easily heard
