i was given a room with the view of the brick wall across the road i asked for a better view given it was a short stay travelling from australia but was told i would have to pay extra on top of paying top dollar for the booking this was disappointing as the hotel shows river views online not brick walls customer service was therefore lacking my quilt cover had blood on it there was only one complementary drink so had to ask for the other as an accor member i wasn t impressed
