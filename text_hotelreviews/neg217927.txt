i came to the breakfast room at and was denied entrance because it was too late i was offered a plain platter to go and requested to take my breakfast elsewhere since nowhere was stated that breakfast was only until and i ordered it ahead it was quite disappointing only a small soap in the bathroom tv jaggy almost unusable and wifi very slow overall this was imo really overpriced for the night with breakfast
