they messed up our reservation we had booked double rooms but when we got there the reception said there is only double room available and offered us a suite with double beds problem is there is no privacy for the people who stayed in that room it s very disappointing and we suspect the hotel has overbooked as there were bus loads of chinese tourists who checked in after us surprisingly they had no room issues the air conditioning of our rooms including the suite was not working overall a poor experience
