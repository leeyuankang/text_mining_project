few non bread choices i asked for a substitution for the bagel with the salmon ie greens or fruit but it wasn t provided in the end no possibility to order an egg sandwich instead of a bacon sandwich would be nice if they contracted with a local place to offer a better breakfast or worked out an egg option but the place is so terrific otherwise i will definitely stay there again
