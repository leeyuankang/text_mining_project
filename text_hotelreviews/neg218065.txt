the breakfast is quite pricey for quite a basic breakfast though it was all very tasty and nicely presented would have liked a proper full length mirror in the room other than just the one located inside the wardrobe door which is built in to the alcove it wasn t really in a good position for me to be able to blow dry my hair comfortably also could have done with a better lit mirror somewhere to do my makeup as had to lean over the sink which was quite awkward unless you are really tall
