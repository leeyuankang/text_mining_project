i appreciated the double pane glass of the windows in my sleeping room but it would have been nice to have the same in the bathroom frith street and the bar across the street can become a bit noisy at night shutting the door to the bath was a good solution but i found the air in the bath a bit too cool for my liking in the morning not a particularly negative thing more of a suggestion to consider
