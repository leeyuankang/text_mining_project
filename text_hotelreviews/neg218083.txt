the basement room had little daylight and no aspect it was almost claustrophic the over bath shower was problematic the in the round shower curtain and position of controls caused us to flood the floor with water unfortunately using the bath would have been easier noises from the plumbing were also interesting the lack of an upstairs breakfast room was a pity as it would have been nice to have enjoyed some of the interiors however tea and coffee delivered to our room in the morning was nice and enjoyable
