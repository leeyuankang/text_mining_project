the hotel is very dated no lift elevator or onsite restaurant the room was either to hot or too cold when a c was activated the shower was quirky to use could not use the electrical outlets to charge my cell phone despite having an appropriate wall plug adapter had to use the usb port on the tv which took forever finally the cost per night was excessive for this property
