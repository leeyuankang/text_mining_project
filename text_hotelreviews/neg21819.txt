the only thing i did not like that i found no one at the reception when i was leaving for my flight it was am and i wanted to check out before i leave and i had to try to shout to see if anyone is there the lights were turned off and all i thought receptions work in all hotels another thing is that in our room there was a separate door and room for the toilet but the bidet was with the main bathroom next to the shower and sink that was so confusing there was no point of doing that everything else was perfect though
