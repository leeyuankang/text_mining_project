it was bought as a present for my sister but even though i was promised the night before she could check in she was not allowed ended up using nearly all her spends to pay for the room her review follows the room service was wrong on the first night someone walked into our room and the fire alarm went off in the evening i slept eventually with the door barricaded with a small wooded contraption i cried once in the morning and once at night they are unbending in their rules and gave me a bottle of wine to apologise they admitted the information was wrong but the guy who spoke to me was in training i could not go out in the evening as could not afford it i had to stay in the hotel for the friday and was able to spend what little money i had on the saturday oh and at breakfast i hope you don t get stuck in the little cupboard they have the deluxe double room had no charger next to the bed and the wardrobe is really for one person for one night when i had a shower i had to remember to move the toilet roll as it got soaked the night before our anniversary was ruined apart from what we salvaged and this was all down to the hotel very upset with their unbending policies they need to think about their customers
