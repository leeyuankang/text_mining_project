our rooms were not well lit and directly faced other rooms opposite in an open space in the middle of the hotel above the breakfast lounge ask for rooms above floor if possible because of high season breakfast lounge worked on overbooking so they improvised alternatives in adjacent restaurant or in a large conference room unfortunately in the alternative locations some menu items were missing and in all breakfast locations they were very slow to refill empty bowls or simply said they were out of that menu item or dish
