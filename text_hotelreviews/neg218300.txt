the hotel was very pricey for the rooms and services they offer we called several times for sugar and other items and they say they are sending it but they never come and you have to keep calling again and again also the rooms weren t cleaned properly every night water and tea weren t refilled properly and water bottles were charged in the minibar they provided us with some sparkling water bottles that didn t taste like water at all
