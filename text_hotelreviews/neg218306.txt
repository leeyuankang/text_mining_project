what they consider a family studio is a bad joke i ve stayed in single rooms in tokyo that were significantly larger just adding a cheap sofa bed to a small room does not make it a studio suitable for families i agreed with the front desk that they would at least close and open it every day as otherwise we could barely move around the room use the desk or open the refrigerator they failed to do so every single day without our going to reception to complain and then wait a further half hour people were pleasant and apologized profusely but service is horrible the restaurant is also way too small for the volume of people with waits up to minutes to seat for breakfast even with overflow to the lounge areas i learned an important lesson about putting too much faith in online reviews which seemed mostly positive i assume those will drop quickly once more guests share their experiences
