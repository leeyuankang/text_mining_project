the blind did not work and when we asked someone to come and fix it they did not turn up we had to get the children to sleep so cancelled the call for someone to come and check however they still turned up at o clock in the evening waking us up next day even though the room said do not disturb site staff entered the room while we were swimming to fix the blind and then phoned when we were back to see if they could come and fix it breakfast choice was good but most of the food was not kept warm enough view of train tracks going into waterloo not good value for money
