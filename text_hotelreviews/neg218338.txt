we could not find any form of information on how things worked in the room and the staff gave no instructions when we were shown into the room the lighting throughout the accommodation areas especially in the room was appalling without any information on how the control systems worked it took quite a while to work things out by trial and error the bare wooden plastic floor in the main part of the room gave a feeling of austerity rather than comfort and certainly did not help any cosy ambiance it was also noisy and we could hear people moving around in the room above when we first tried to close the blind it did not work it just made a mechanical grinding noise an engineer arrived quickly to repair it but even then it did not always work properly with one side sometimes failing to come down this required the process to be stopped reversed and re started to get the blind down not everybody would have realised this but i saw the engineer do it the shower leaked out into the hand basin area but fortunately the bath mat absorbed most of it the sliding door that closed off either the shower area or toilet area was very heavy and not easy to move there was no door to close off the bathroom area completely a lack of privacy not enjoyed by everyone there was clearly some confusion among the staff on when rooms should be serviced on the first day it was being done when we returned from breakfast on the second day it had not been done at all when we returned to our room at about however soon after that somebody came in without knocking apparently to do it then we were getting ready to go out again so it was not convenient and as we had made the bed and did not want the towels changed we asked them not to bother we did leave a hand written critique along these lines when we checked out
