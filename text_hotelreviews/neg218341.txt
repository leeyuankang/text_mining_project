very expensive breakfast however there are several caf s and a tesco nearby which is a good alternative the hotel is located near a hospital so ambulances with sirens are quite common both day and night i can t say it bothered me too much though the rooms are a bit pricy but considering it s london i d say it s quite good value for money
