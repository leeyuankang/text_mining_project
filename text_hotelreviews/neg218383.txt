the room i was given was a nice room however the waste water soil pipe from the room above passes through the room and every time the shower basin toilet was used i could hear it going down the waste soil pipe i did report it on checking out it was almost as if the waste pipe was leaking the music in the bar restaurant area is way too loud and people have to talk louder to make themselves heard consequently it s impossible to have a quiet meal or drink the breakfast area is way too cramped a space i noticed an overflow area in the bar seating area adjacent breakfast hunched over a low table isn t the way to start the day
