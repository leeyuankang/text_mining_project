i didn t like the lighting in the hotel corridors and lifts dingy with fluorescent colours i prefer natural light on the way to the hotel my credit card got left in the cab from the airport when i realised this and told the hotel staff at check in and the concierge desk i got an indifferent response would expect more help and responsiveness and interest to begin with in a situation like that
