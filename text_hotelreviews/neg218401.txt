water were not hot enough in the shower was a bit of a problem since we were traveling with a baby we talked about it with the hotel but the problem was not solved and we were not informed in anyway regarding the issue seem like they ignored we also booked a taxi to the airport using the concierge service we explicitly asked and confirmed with them to bring a baby car seat which of course they haven t they brought a booster for a years old and we had to carry the baby in our arms on the way back
