we had no water in our room to shower flush toilet or get washed for the full morning on sunday april so we had to go to a friends room and adults had to shower in one small room which made us late to our event as we did not know this was going to happen when we woke up to get ready the staff where not very helpful or apologetic and this is not good enough for the price we paid
