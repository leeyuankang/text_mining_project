the room was rather small for family of children aged we had to ask for extra towels as they had only given for including the wash products we also had to ask for the complimentary robes as they too were not in the room breakfast on the second morning was disappointing i don t think they were prepared for the volume of people they placed us in the overflow part which was the restaurant nice enough however there were no cutlery mugs and although not too far from the breakfast serving area it was far enough when you had to make several journeys because when you did go there was was no bread beans and a large que for the coffee machine the swimming pool was lovely not big but nice enough however there was no hairdryers in the ladies changing room which meant we had to go back to our rooms to dry our hair which was a bit inconvenient when you had brought everything else with you to go straight for lunch the lady on reception did offer to get one from house keeping which was lovely but there was no where in the changing room to plug it in a bit bizarre finally i think the fire alarm went off at we didn t need to leave the room after we had all got up and dressed but this we only found out by ringing reception no apologies
