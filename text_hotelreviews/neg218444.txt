the bathroom area wasn t well lit not just due to an overhead bulb failure impossible to see well enough to use make up this was also the case in the bedroom i had to make do with my own hand held mirror by the window not clever a well lit magnifying mirror would have been useful good hairdryer was provided but metres away from the nearest and only mirror albeit a large full length one we don t all have vision i found it strange that the carpeted area was in the walking areas only i personally like carpet underfoot when getting in and out of bed perhaps slippers could have been provided only one teaspoon with the drinks facility an oversight i m sure i think some people may find the very modern chrome handles on the bathroom doors difficult to grip i consider myself fit and healthy but am of the mature age group and i didn t find them easy to use to pull the door open similarly the door leading to and from the ladies off the reception area was awkward being glass it s heavy but more importantly on leaving the area the approach to the door is underlit so that the black vertical door handle against the black glass door is virtually invisible some lighting would be most helpful although i found the hi tech control system for the room very novel for me there was a lack of general information of the old fashioned printed type there was info re room service meals but i was unaware of anything to do with the restaurant or other facilities that the hotel provided maybe it was all there on screen but i wasn t in the room long enough to avail myself of the tv service and i wasn t advised to do so in spite of these criticisms my friend and i enjoyed our stay and may well return
