honestly there is nothing i could fault our mini bar wasn t working so i missed my glass of vino before bed at night but i didn t make the hotel aware of it until my day they would have delivered to the room but i just didn t bother not a complaint at all i m sure if i had said it in my first night it would have been rectified
