the view from our room was somewhat dissapointing and so we moved rooms the staff were great and arranged this straight away the view was slightly better in that we could see a little more of london and the top of the london eye the hotel is not in the best position if a view is what your looking for for the short time we were in the room we just kept the blind down the majority of the time
