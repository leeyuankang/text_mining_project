the bed was very uncomfortable the mood lighting in the room would only stay on for a maximum of seconds the overground trains were loud and i could hear this from my room there was also a fire alarm on one of the nights i stayed as i was playing music in my room it was only until someone called me and stopped my music playing i heard faint beeping where even without the music the alarm was faint so i decided to open the door of the room to then discover that faint beeping was actually a fire warning to exit the building if an entire hotel needs to be evacuated i suggest putting these alarms in the rooms as well as in the hallway if it was a serious emergency where the hotel was really in danger if someone hadn t rang me to stop my music i wouldn t have heard it
