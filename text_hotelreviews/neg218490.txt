when booking via booking com i booked a superior king double room with a city view when i got to my room it was a small double room with an internal view on the floor this was disappointing based on what was advertised i asked reception about the room and the view and they were supposed to contact me later that evening about potentially moving but i did not hear back from them the price of the breakfast advertised on booking com was also not accurate and much more expensive then the price at the hotel
