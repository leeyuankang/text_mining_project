the design of the hotel is inferior to the other park plaza hotels i have stayed at i went to the wrong park plaza it should have this more clearly marked on the site as new location as i am used to staying in either county hall or westminster and this was the waterloo location all very confusing the colour scheme yellow and grey is painful as are the references to cities around the world so dated the rooms are much smaller than other pp s and the feeling style was more in line with an ibis hotel remote batteries were critically low so couldn t use the tv very well the screen was welcoming some other person not me the tea set was positioned where there wasn t a plug when asked the staff about this they said some have plugs and some don t great answer not all together a great stay
