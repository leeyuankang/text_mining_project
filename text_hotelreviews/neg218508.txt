i booked a city view room only to be told that no such room exists guest services let down the rest of the team here we had to call for some toilet roll as this wasn t replaced breakfast order completely incorrect and half hour spent trying to rectify for it to still be wrong upon having our room cleaned champagne glasses we took on the trip ourselves had been taken later replaced as we were given new ones to keep iron was not available in our room so again had to call for one let s just say i didn t like having to call guest services as often as i did such a shame
