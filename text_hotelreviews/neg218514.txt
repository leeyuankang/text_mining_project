on booking i was asked for a eta which was provided and we arrived within the provided window then arriving at the hotel they told us the room won t be ready for another and a half hours when we got to the room hours later the room was set up incorrectly as a twin room this combines with a early checkout time left us feeling like we hadn t got our money s worth
