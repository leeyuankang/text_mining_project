the bathroom was not completely clean and the layout was a bit strange with sliding doors which meant that the doors never properly shut and so there wasn t much privacy the room was quite cold even though we would increase the temperature of the room the default setting was quite low so everytime we came to our room it was cold the spa was not what we expected it was just an indoor pool a sauna and a steam room we were expecting warm pools with jets etc but they did not have these the hotel in general is quite cold ie in the hallways entrance hall and in the spa area it would have certainly been nice to heat the spa areas to make it feel more comfortable and less like a swimming pool
