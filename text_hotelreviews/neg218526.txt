breakfast was absolutely shocking we was not served any drinks or toast with breakfast and i did not get what i asked for the price of breakfast was but i would say was only worth round it was awful and an absolute rip off i also booked this hotel for me and my partner sadly he could not get the time off of his new job to attend so i tried to change the date of the booking to the following weekend and i was happy to pay any additional cost to my disgust i was advise i am not allowed to change the date and if i do not attend i will be charged the full amount of the room i understand this was no cancellation but i should of been able to change the date of the booking due to unforeseen circumstances so in turn i had to bring my mother
