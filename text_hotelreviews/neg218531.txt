the fire alarm waking us up after a late night and having to throw our clothes on and evacuate wasn t much fun just glad we didn t go for our morning swim some instructions in the room on how to work lights and blinds would have been helpful but got there in the end also the key pads on the lockers in the pool area were impossible when going swimming as they were far too small to work out without glasses
