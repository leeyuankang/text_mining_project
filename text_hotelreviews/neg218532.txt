our stay was ruined by the fire alarm i know there s nothing the staff can do about this but it was a false alarm and certainly put a downer on our stay at this hotel particularly as we were in the spa had been there only a few minutes and the fire alarms were so loud i had ringing in my ears and a headache for the rest of the day which was certainly not good when exploring london for the day if you re looking to go to the london eye and other attractions and plan on walking like we did both the other park plaza hotels westminster bridge and county hall are much much closer
