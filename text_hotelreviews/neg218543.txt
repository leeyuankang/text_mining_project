i had booked breakfast with my stay and was challenged on at least four separate occasions to say breakfast wasn t included despite showing them my booking receipt once was while i was actually eating the breakfast that and part of the shower was broken in my room the bar staff whilst very friendly did have to ask for my drinks order times as well a theme despite the other in my party getting their drinks about minutes before me the staff were very apologetic but one drink from their cocktail menu shouldn t be too difficult to make
