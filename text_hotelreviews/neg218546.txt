first the hotel design is very modern dark and disorienting i would have thought i d like it but walking down the halls and using elevators and lobby rest room is a very odd experience the light creates distortion and makes depth perception difficult it feels like a las vegas casino where you have no sense of time or space second this hotel is just not ready to be open yet the simplest things in most hotels became a monumental task the hotel seems designed by some one who has never actually experienced it so things that may seem cool on paper simply don t work in reality for real hotel guests when we checked in i tried to plug in my lap top and the socket fell out of the wall i called guest services and they sent an engineer who came and went times and finally said he can t fix it and went away meanwhile i tried to iron my business clothes for my next day s meeting the ironing board was also broken i was able to jerry rig it back together but it sat on the desk rather then stood on legs so didn t work well at all very cheap design by someone who must not ever actually iron their clothes and too small for functionality when i got back to the room i tried to take a shower the water pressure was very low and the water luke warm i ran it for a long time no change it was difficult to get my hair fully rinsed from the shampoo providing a bathrobe was a nice touch but it was so small it would only fit a small sized person i called and asked for a bigger one but none ever arrived i ordered some room service lobster mac and cheese there was not one piece of lobster in the entire dish and it cost pounds later in my stay i tried a hamburger although the food came on a rolling table equipped with a hot box the waiter had the food on top of the table and so it was cold by the time it arrived the waiter didn t seem to know the hot box was there even when i asked
