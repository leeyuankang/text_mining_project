advertised sauna and spa are not yet ready i have photos of the situation these show the unattended spot entrance surely a violation of health and safety regulations even if these are sometimes unnecessary i showed this for the morning of the second day when it was true the first evening the timing is visible on my photos weirdly the staff seem i don t wear the only the pool is operative the pool is ok the sauna is not listed as out of order but as a fellow visitor confirmed it is basically an ordinary warm room show a photo with my hand on the heating facility the steam room is posted as out of order a woman who joined me at the spot in the morning was deeply disappointed as she had booked solely to handle her sinus problems i marked the hotel is not clean which is unfair it is due solely to disgusting damp paper towel s lying about near the swimming pool which put me off swimming the treatment rooms which are advertised even in the key card exist solely as a sign on the door i have shown the sign and the rather disturbingly unsanitary and messy inside storage area i am sure it will be a very nice hotel when it is finished and so i don t blame the individual staff even the young man who rang my bell to be sure that i didn t want to be disturbed waking me
