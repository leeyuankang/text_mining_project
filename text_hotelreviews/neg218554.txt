when i booked my room i booked a city view top floor kings suite i was very unhappy to not get this as i was planing on taking photos and posting them on my blog and instagram of the beautiful city view so the fact that i didn t totally get what i payed for made me unhappy but as i was visiting galleries all day and it was raining my feet were wet and i was tired so i therefore didn t address it other wise i could not fault the service the view really wasn t worth taking a picture off
