first room had a draft coming through from under cupboards but given its a new hotel expect teething issues manager was great and moved us straight away to a new room which was lovely old room took a while to warm up so not sure if ac isn t working as should small cleanliness issues such as wrappers under drawer and window ledge stains first room minibar was half empty second room still things missing also as the hotel is next to a train station the room can be noisy i don t think it s built in a way to keep our the train and road vehicle noise the other point walls and doors are thin so thin that each time someone in hotel rooms next to us are opening their door we thought someone is opening out door also opening and closing doors as well as talking is easily heard from your room bed
