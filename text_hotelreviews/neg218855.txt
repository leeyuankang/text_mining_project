only one problem when i was leaving in the morning i waited nearly minutes for a lift every time one appeared it was full with cleaners and laundry trolleys etc and those of us waiting to go up to our rooms could not get in this made me late for my morning meeting and it was pretty frustrating however it was one small complaint amongst many wonderful things
