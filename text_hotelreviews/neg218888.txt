the room was tiny well laid out for fitting everything in but basically you could hop on the bed or into the bathroom pod and that s about it it wasn t cleaned properly and you couldn t open the door to the bathroom pod without it hitting the toilet and making a massive clang the ipad set up for the room was cool but it ran out of battery as we didn t put it back on the charger correctly our fault i know but it s a huge design flaw if the ipad is dead you can t do anything
