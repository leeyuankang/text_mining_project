i wouldn t come with anyone else there s an open style bathroom basin is part of the room which is fine on your own but a bit too intimate for sharing the room is very small which again is fine for a night or two but for a longer stay i d get cabin fever the citizen theme is cute and it s a clever way to excuse themselves from providing tea and coffee etc in the room there s a communal lounge downstairs i like the hotel s atmosphere but they ll need to watch it or the place might feel dated before long
