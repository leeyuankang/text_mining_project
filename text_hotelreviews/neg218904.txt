however there was one huge thing missing for me and that was tea and coffee making facilities part of enjoying a break away for me is making a morning coffee in the room and snuggling back in bed with news channel on instead i had to get up get dressed and go down in the lift to the canteen in reception pay a fiver for a tea and coffee and take them back to the room which rather defeated the object if we stay there again which we probably will i will take my own travel kettle and coffee supplies
