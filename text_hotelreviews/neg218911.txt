although the staff were present there could ve been more of them to assist especially during check in we had some challenges with the electronic door lock which meant we had to bang into the door in order to open it the thermostat didn t heat up the room when we turn the temperature up to when we got back to our room after the event we could smell like a wast drain smell coming from the sink we sprayed some perfume in order to mask it and turned on the fan by morning time it was minimal but i reported it the staff so they could check the plumbing
