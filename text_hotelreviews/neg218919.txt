the windows don t open so there was no fresh air in the room the bathroom smelled really musty and of drains which was quite unpleasant also it wasn t super clean there was a layer of dust on the shelves and the hairdryer bag under the sink the tv channels were really random all german and spanish channels and they don t do hour room service as advertised overall it suited our needs and was the perfect location for us but little things let it down which was a shame
