although it was large the bed was not the most comfortable and there were only two pillows before we requested additional pillows which were brought to us by the friendly staff also the room had a weird drainage like smell on arrival and it did feel like there was a lack of natural oxygen which made it difficult for both me and my girlfriend to get to sleep
