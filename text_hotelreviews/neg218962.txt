rooms were a bit small i have a big suitcase and had trouble making space to open it up everything was very clean except one day when we found a towel with traces of make up that had apparently survived the washing machine that was no problem though we had enough towels music in the lobby breakfast room was a bit too loud i d prefer something quieter and more relaxing especially in the morning
