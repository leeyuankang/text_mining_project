only negative thing we stayed for nights after the night we did not leave our towels on the floor meaning we want to use them again they were replaced after the night i explicitly wrote a note to the housekeeper saying that we would be fine with the same towels and would not need new ones for just one more night they were replaced again it might me meant well but i think it was a waste and ecological non sense to exchange towels days in a row shower floor hands towels each day
