to me the hotel is basically an easyhotel dressed up in hipster clothes to justify an exorbitant price tag an ipad mini installed with a few gimmicky controls to change the colour of the light bulbs does little to make up for the cramped room and lack of the basics like a mini bar with a few refreshments or even i dunno tea and coffee facilities sorry i expected a little more for my money
