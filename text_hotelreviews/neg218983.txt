tiny room with a sink in the room and not in the so called bathroom the bed filled the end of the small room so don t expect to climb in from either side as you have to crawl over your partner if you want the bathroom oh and the bathroom has no soundproofing pretty embarrassing if you aren t open minded this place is fine for teenagers but not for grown ups doing business wayyy too small and cramped not even a wardrobe or iron style over substance for sure and hideously expensive for what you get i m going back to the hoxton or hilton thanks
