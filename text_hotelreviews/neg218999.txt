the food in the restaurant was a little disappointing we wanted to have dinner there our last night but all they had was salmon lamb and sushi those seem like strange choices i would have been happy with any beef or chicken or even a vegetarian main unfortunately that wasn t an option it was nice that they had drinks and food that you could bring up to the room at all hours great for midnight snacks
