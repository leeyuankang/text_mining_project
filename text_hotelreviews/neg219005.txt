nothing but issues when trying to pay for conference guests errors made with bookings constantly told that i had made mistakes when booking i had not payments not taken by hotel so our guests were told they had to pay when i called the hotel was told that we could not pay via booking com and only can pay directly via website i have made many bookings via booking com where you have to pay in advance for best rate and have never had any issues then received no show charges and was told because i had made duplicate bookings via booking com and directly on the hotel website again this was not the case all the bookings were made via one source overall staff very unhelpful when i tried to get this all sorted so much so that despite the location and the facilities rooms at the hotel i would not stay again feedback from conference guests was that reception staff were very rude as well
