the hotel reminded me of somewhere you would take a school trip to the rooms were tiny like walking into a storage crate adequate but that was it it s not good having to crawl over someone in bed to go to the loo because the bed is wedged at the far end of the room the bathrooms were seriously underwhelming and no privacy a glass capsule in a room with a door that doesn t fit is not appropriate
