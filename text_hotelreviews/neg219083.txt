unfortunately there was a problem with our airconditioning so we were woken up a couple of times the first night by loud noises coming from the airco the next morning we told the staff and they immediately apologised and relocated us to a different room on the same floor they even moved our bags for us so compliments to the staff despite this unfortunate event
