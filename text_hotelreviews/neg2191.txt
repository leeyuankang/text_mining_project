i booked a deluxe double and was told that the room had a queen size bed however the bed was pretty small the duvet was quite thin so i had to call down reception at for a blanket also the room was very small quite claustrophobic the next morning after checking out we went to the bar to have a coffee we are the only ones there the barman took our order then disappeared for minutes and didn t make our coffees so we left not good service at all
