all was great but note this place is not where one finds peace and quiet after a long london day because of loud music on canteen and communal areas lots of technology to manage via an ipad in the room can be a bit annoying especially the lights because some cannot be switched off individually so it is either plenty of lights on or complete darkness in the room
