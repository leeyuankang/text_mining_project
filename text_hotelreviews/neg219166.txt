the basics no toilet paper in my room upon arrival even after requests that evening i had to wait hours for the next day and a third request to get a roll that s elementary watson no hot water in shower for days being frustrated and annoyed i was given a note with an apology and drinks on the house seriously first room i was given was for people with special needs looks nothing like the rooms shown on the hotels website i was not informed of the special room that has a strange feeling to it with all the handles on the walls stings coming down the ceiling in case of an emergency and wired bathroom its design is not practical for anyone no toilet paper hot water or good vibes had them reluctant to change my room staff consists mainly of youngsters foreign and inexperienced their friendly act probably requested as part of the hotel vibe came across at times as overly friendly to a point of rude crude and there were two occasions that were totally inappropriate in conclusion this new hotel trying to be young and hip comes across as underwhelming and inexperienced as much as it s members of staff first time and last time for me no recommendations on my part
