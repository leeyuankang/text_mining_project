the room was tiny looked and felt as if i were staying in a campervan if two people were sleeping in the double bed one person would have to climb over the other to get in or out bed up against three walls the washbasin was in the bedroom not the bathroom cubicle and the space for belongings was tiny only stayed two nights and felt claustrophobic hated that everything is controlled by an i pad can t even switch on a light at night to go to the loo without using the i pad
