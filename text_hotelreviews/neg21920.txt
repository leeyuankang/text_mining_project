very poor lighting in room and no lights in hallway until you walk than they turn on by sensor scary to be in the dark in a hotel esp coming off the elevator rooms are candle like lights only too dark to find things in your room better hotels for the money such tiny rooms people couldn t fit comfortably even at night all lights are out key activated good luck going to toilet in the night find your way in total darkness lights by key st the door
