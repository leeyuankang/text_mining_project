on arrival i d left my luggage in reception as i was meeting my friend in the bar and i was assured this would be carried up to the room when we got to the room hours later in the evening my luggage had not been delivered had to ask for it secondly the wellness area is nice but the cctv camera is really off putting one feels observed if this is for security it would be better to have some other emergency alarm system
