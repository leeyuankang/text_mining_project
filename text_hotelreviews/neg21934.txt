it was mostly excellent one morning i asked for a pastry recommendation and the person suggested le pain quotidien i m nitpicking here but given i was in paris i don t expect to be sent to a chain store which exists in the uk when there are pastry coffee shops on every corner that s a small criticism of an otherwise brilliant place
