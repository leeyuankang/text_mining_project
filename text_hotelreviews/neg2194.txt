i booked a deluxe double room there was nothing deluxe about it the room was tiny literally the smallest box room i have ever stayed in the bathroom towels were dirty and we had to request new ones be provided the shower curtain did nothing to prevent the water covering the entire bathroom floor which meant there was nowhere to then stand at the sink without getting wet there were no plugs near mirrors which made getting ready difficult i resorted to using the tv to see my reflection as i blow dryed my hair the room quickly got condensation due to it being so small however no windows could be opened altogether an awful experience and i will not be staying there again the pictures were completely disieving and the cost was ridiculous based on what we actually got very very disappointing
