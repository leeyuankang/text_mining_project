i booked a superior double room expecting a beautiful bed with a princess feel as the images suggested but was sorely disappointed what i got in reality was two large single bed mattresses pushed together which proceeded to slip apart through the night this along with other issues like broken door handles broken shower dials and inattentive staff at breakfast really ruined the entire experience particularly as the hotel was very expensive and booked as an extravagant birthday present did not meet expectations
