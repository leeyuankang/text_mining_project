room size is very small strange bathroom design where they separated the toilet seat from the sink and shower by a wall so you have to step out of the toilet seat room walk across your room and enter the other part of the bathroom just doesn t make sense also the receptionist working during my departure was not friendly and seemed bothered when i inquired as to why i wasn t getting my full pre autherization back so i asked for an invoice and figured it out myself totally unacceptable behavior
