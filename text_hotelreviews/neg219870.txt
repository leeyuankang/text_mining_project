the elevator was out of order in the evening on two days in a row the bathroom was not separated from the rest of the room and the shower was separated with a normal glass so that one could have no privacy while in the shower the toilet was separate from the bath but there was no sink inside so that one had to go to the bathroom to wash his hands
