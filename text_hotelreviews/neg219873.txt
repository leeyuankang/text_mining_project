i feel very conflicted about this hotel unfortunately ultimately i wouldn t recommend it because with our experience the bad outweighed the good the fire alarm went off late on sunday night july on the first night we stayed so naturally everyone evacuated and stood outside it was absolutely pouring so not the best start eventually a member of hotel staff came to the front desk and the alarm was silenced i would say the alarm had been going for about minutes at this point though and there wasn t a staff member to tell us if it was a false alarm or real or anything she explained in a really aggressive manner that there was a fault with the alarm and heavy rain sometimes set it off she seemed irritated we had bothered to evacuate and said that it was not the first time it had happened no apology or further explanation of a fix or anything fair enough though it was close to and we were all a bit moody we arrived back at the hotel on our first day and the girl at the front desk informed us the lift was broken we were on the top floor which was a pain but being able bodied it was hardly a big deal however it was not fixed for the full days of our stay again no apology offered at any point they did however offer to help getting luggage downstairs which was a godsend no idea what they would have done if they had disabled guests all in all the staff were unpleasant to deal with when we returned to the hotel in the evening we arrived home late from disneyland on tuesday night and asked for some milk sachets for the room and we were told no milk is available by an exasperated girl on the front desk who was busy making a personal call we walked up the four flights of stairs and found some milk sachets on a cleaning trolley on the landing so i think she just had no interest in being helpful also just a word of advice our room had the wc seperate then a shower in the middle of the bedroom
