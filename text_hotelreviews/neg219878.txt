we love try new boutique hotel but this hotel is far from what we expected the worse room ever we get for this category and happily we were upgraded we can t imagine the room we booked room are dark no well maintain we request for a quiet room and they give us a room with no view to the back of a restaurant so that we can hear the kitchen from late evening and early morning we won t recommend this hotel for a luxury traveler
