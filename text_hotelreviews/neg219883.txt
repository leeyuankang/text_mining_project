our room was extremely dark and very small the door on the toilet did not lock the bathroom was not separate from the bedroom the toilet was black the walls were decorated with black wall paper and the floor had black tiles the lighting in the actual bedroom was not great and it was hard to do hair and make up because of this the room did not have dressing gowns as stated and the tea making facilities were very limited with plastics mugs plastic stirers only one teabag the bath was very narrow and short which made it hard to bath the shower was attached half way up the wall and the tiles did not go up to the ceiling so showering whilst standing was not an option there was no mirror or in the actual room only in the bathroom area which meant if one person wanted to dry hair and get ready while the other was showering you could only achieve this if you were both in the bathroom allowing no privacy
