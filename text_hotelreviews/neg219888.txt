nothing about it was as portrayed on their website the entry and check in was extremely sub standard the room was only accessible by numerous stairs and extremely small with the toilet and shower in the bed room in full view no walls the view out of the room was to a very close brick wall the entire hotel was very dark we were told by the staff that it was an hour from the eiffel tower yet it comes up under the heading of hotels in close proximity to the eiffel tower we were charged an extra to be put in an only very slightly larger room that was accessible by lift with the toilet in its own little room again with an awful brick wall view when i requested to take photos of the original room that we were given they refused to let me have access the only attractive thing about both rooms were the bed linens the staff were very rude when we voiced our disappointment
