first the people manning the service counters are not consistent the team during day time are quite pleasant and accommodating but at night the lady was quite irritable and impatient i approached her to ask for help on translating a french website as i was trying to purchase museum tickets and instead of greeting with a smile she growled what s your room number and the way she acted condescendingly as if i was an inconvenience and she couldn t turn her back fast enough after giving me to word responses i just attributed it to her having a bad day but that wasn t really a great reflection of the the hotel second the wifi didn t quite reach my room i had to go to the hallway to get a working signal but i should have called the hotel s attention for that so that shortcoming is also on me
