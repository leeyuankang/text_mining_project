it s one of those hotels that has fancy photos but when you get there you realise that you are tricked honestly it was one of my worst stays all the interior of the hotel is black and it feels more like a stripe club the receptions were so mean and rude so everytime when we were entering the lobby they wouldn t even bother to look who is this not smile and not even saying a simple hello it was like we have done smth bad and we own them we wanted to extend our stay in paris for more days and asked the reception for extera nights as it was too much hassle to find another hotel they said you have to pay euros more for each night plus your normal rate we were happy to pay something sensible but they though we have loads of money so they were trying to rib us off later on there were this nice blond girl at the reception and she said you don t have to pay anything extra as we have loads of free rooms so we went with her offer what i am saying is that just be so carefull with this hotel and ideally stay away from those people something about the rooms the rooms are so tiny and with black theme of colours it feels like a cage
