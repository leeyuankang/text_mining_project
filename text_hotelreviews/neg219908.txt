the lift was faulty and dropped floor while we were in it the door opened between floors which was concerning the staff knew about it but didnt inform us the rooms were small and packed with useless furniture making the room inpractical and difficult to manuvour around the toilet was seperate to the bathroom with poor lighting black walls and sanitaryware so it felt like you were in a torture chamber when using it the coffee wasn t replenished daily and we had to keep phoning reception to ask for more on one morning i had to ask the cleaner in the adjacent bedroom to stop banging around as it sounded like we was trying to break through into our room
