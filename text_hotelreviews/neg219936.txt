since i travel to paris at least times a year for work i booked as a single traveller a double room since i have terror of paris hotel single rooms the room i was given was tiny and not more than square meter in their booking page they claim a room size of square meter when i complained they told me straight into my face that i was wrong and that the room size was exactly as on the web no change of rate or at least a free breakfast was offered to compensate hospitality of the lowest category so i paid for a double room got a small single room with a tiny bathroom where they had to fix the sink outside because it did not fit into the bath i feel cheated the money of course was deducted before my arrival first two pictures are the room i got and the third picture is from their booking com site for exactly the same room category i booked
