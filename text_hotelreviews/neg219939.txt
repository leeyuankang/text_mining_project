we ve booked a superior room but the room we stayed is a classic room for sure there were just the room facilities of a classic room and the room was soooooo small than it s written they insist on that it was a superior room but it was not we ve checked from booking com and hotel s website too superior and classic rooms must have been quite different that s why we ve paid an extra euros but we regret our stay at this hotel we d be better to stay at the hotel that was also and with higher rating and euros cheaper
