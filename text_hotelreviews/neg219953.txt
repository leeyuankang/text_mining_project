i was unwell whilst staying here and the staff were most unhelpful there was constant vacuuming going on outside my room there were no do not disturb tags so i called reception asking not to be disturbed but despite this housekeeping knocked on my door when i was trying to rest the restaurant only serves cold food one particular member of staff at reception was very unhelpful i got more assistance getting medical attention i needed from staff in a local restaurant than i did at the hotel
