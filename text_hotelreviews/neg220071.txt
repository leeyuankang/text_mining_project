when we arrived they said they had our reservation but no room for us and would transfer to a nearby hotel that s even better the other hotel was also a star but definitely not the same style old british style very outdated not better at all not even similar i would have never book that hotel we felt forced to go there and where extremely unhappy about it the staff couldn t care less we still end up sleeping at new roblin after we call and complain about the room of the other hotel i will never book again at new roblin and i advise people not to book there you might sleep in another ugly hotel for the same price
