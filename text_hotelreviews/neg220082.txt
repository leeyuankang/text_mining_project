breakfast room was crowded and seemed like not meeting the needs of the volume of guests both mornings we ate there several things were missing plates bread etc however the food was very nice freshly baked bread and a nice selection of cheeses if you want a quiet breakfast try to get a table at the end of the room close to the windows also if you come by car please note that parking can be difficult
