the hot options for breakfast were not that great the scrambled eggs had a grainy texture and the sausages were like warm cocktail franks the restaurant was disappointing i had the roast beef and i got a chunk of beef and fries no vegetables and no option to order them as sides the bar opens and which is a bit inconvenient when you come back after a day of exploring the city
