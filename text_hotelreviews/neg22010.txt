had a mixed experience with the staff first day excellent helpful and friendly second day at checkout i was charged twice because the guy was convinced that i did not pay that was rather frustrating but later his colleague sent me an email to say that the refund was arranged so this speaks in their favour despite the negative experience after reading other comments related to the room size i decided to book a double room still there was barely any space for my carry on suitcase i don t think a double room would fit two people
