we arrived at for breakfast there were no eggs only scrambled eggs that were runny we asked for eggs to be arranged so we could cook them in the boiler provided ourselves were told that there would be no eggs for the day there was no alternative to pork for breakfast and only cheese selection we also felt that the hotel could offer cooked tomatoes mushrooms or fried eggs omelette without having to pay extra that was disappointing and we had breakfast outside of the hotel the room should be fitted for people who enjoy tea not just coffee we had to request a kettle there was no tea or milk
