the room is tiny and not worth for the price at all it s even hard to find a place open your inch luggage there is only a small desk under the screen which is not enough for me to place my laptop and checking emails also there was no tooth brush toothpaste and comb in the bathroom i asked for the reception desk and they gave me but without comb the main lift was always out of service i don t recommend anyone used to stay in a star or star hotels to waste your money on this hotel take your time find another place
