a little disappointing with regard to rooms they are small but that s a function of the building rather than the hotel and let s remember it is architecturally beautiful paris but not necessarily modern we were on the floor and you have to get the staff lift up there which is not cool would be better to lift to the and then walk finally most annoyingly they make you pay for your nespresso capsule
