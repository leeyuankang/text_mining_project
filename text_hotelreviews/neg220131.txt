unfortunately the two roaches on the wall in the dining area took away from the breakfast experience the food was not very good at all the bacon was completely raw and the coffee was not like it used to be when we have stayed at the hotel before disappointed in the loss of wifi for two days the public areas were very warm we assumed they would have the air conditioning on clearly the hotel has changed it s just not like it used to be they stayed there four times and there just seems to be a very masculine effect to the hotel now such is life
