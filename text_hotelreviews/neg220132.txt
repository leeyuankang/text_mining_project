no check was an hour and a half later than what was promised on booking that makes it tough after an overnight the internet was unreliable in the lobby and unavailable in the room at first the hotel denied there was a problem as i overheard them tell guests while i waited for my room then said a technician was coming to fix it at some point housekeeping walked into the room without announcing themselves which was kind of weird since i was in the bathroom i think you have to take this with a grain of salt paris in august you have to expect some bumps the folks that make run smoothly are on vacation leaving a skeleton crew that s my guess anyway i have not had these issues when staying there before the staff was polite though and made an effort i will stay there again
