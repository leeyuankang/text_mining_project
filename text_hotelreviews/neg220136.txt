the room and the hallways of the building were uncomfortably hot the hotel refused to take responsibility for the dry cleaning service that chose to re write our order from a request to wash items to dry cleaning items and charging us euro for a service we did not request they produced a sign in our room on day that stated the coffee in room was at a charge and after we checked out proceeded to take unauthorised money from our bank account to cover this small surprise charge of two coffees per day we requested a taxi to pick us up upon check out the hotel took it upon themselves to book a private driver costing us euro for a very short trip to the train station arrogant to say the least and we cannot recommend the hotel based on these experiences
