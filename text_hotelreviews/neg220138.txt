the bar and restaurant opening times days were a bit erratic but it was around bastille day so normal routine was out the window one slight disappointment we had an issue with one of the bathroom fittings on the first day we stayed nights we reported it twice but no action was taken the manager was sceptical and indifferent although most of the staff were friendly and helpful
