slightly scruffy decor in our room and synthetic bedding nothing to write home about just small things our bathroom sink plug got stuck down meaning water couldn t drain away we didn t bother to inform staff as it occurred on the morning of departure i m certain they would have dealt with it straight away had we made them aware of the problem the bar isn t staffed and somewhat lacked atmosphere perhaps some music instead of tv the coffee served with breakfast was pretty bad
