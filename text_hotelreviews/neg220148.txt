the conditions of cancellation are terrible because of the strikes in france our ticket was cancelled by sncf company trains we did not wanted to spend our last days in paris in the middle of street rallies and strikes so we called the hotel to try to cancel our nights that we payed in advance and ask them if they could at least give us back our money for a night and they refused even if it was not our fault but because of the constant strikes in paris the hotel is too dark not enough light in the rooms the restaurant is also dark and depressing
