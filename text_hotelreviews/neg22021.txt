i was very disappointing with this hotel despite reading positive reviews my visit did not reflect this we stayed in room on the floor and i must say i was shocked at the standard from the second i walked in the room was very dark with hardly any sunlight no soundproofing it was very noisy you could hear people talking clearly in other rooms and walking up and down the stairs our tv didn t work and despite reporting it twice the staff where reluctant to do anything about it until we insisted on a discount on the room charge if they didn t room service only put new towels and did not remove the old ones lay the bed or clean the bathroom being a frequent visitor to paris and having stayed in several other hotels in the area this by far does not live up to it s star rating
