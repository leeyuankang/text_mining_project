we booked the comfort double room the room was off the reception on the ground floor street facing and incredibly noisy the first night we got no sleep with people even banging on the shutters the following day we upgraded to the superior double room the room was identical however on a higher floor and much more pleasureful if you are booking do not book the comfort room if you want to sleep
