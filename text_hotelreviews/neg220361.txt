the room although a decent size was poorly designed this was particularly true of the bathroom the separate loo was silly and uncomfortable to use and the shower was poor it was like being dripped on the bed was ok but poor sheet quality the common area was poor and there was no bar overall this was not of the quality your rating suggested
