my booking reservation included an upper floor request i got floor because rooms in the upper floors are bigger and can accommodate more guests beware the room we got was really small for something that is marketed as superior room quality price relation completely out of proportion even taking into account the location in montmartre cannot really understand the top ratings in booking com
