the room reserved three months earlier that was originaly assigned to us was at the ground level with smell of dust and moisture coming from the carpet after stating that it was not what we could accept we received hostile and cynical responses finally we had to spend additional time waiting for another room to be available for us this new room was acceptable this was the third time we are staying in this hotel and it seems that current staff would need to improve the attitude and learn how to show better respect the customer
