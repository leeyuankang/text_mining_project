bathroom facilities unacceptably low standard for the price there is no way you could go back to the hotel looking forward to a shower in fact we dreaded washing cleanliness could be better not in the communal areas which were spotless but in the rooms and especially the bathroom the pillows were very old and there were a lot of soft furnishings around the room which did not seem fresh on the one hand there is a little old charm but on the other the place seemed dated in not a great way and the facilities need refreshing
