the hotel advertised air conditioning our room and other guest complained in the middle of the night of no air conditioning we could open the windows but the traffic and construction on the building noise caused a lack of sleep this was my first trip to paris and the experience here makes it my last management tried to move us to a cooler room but it was broken too then to add to the heat we had accommodations for family room and the new room only had bed it had a pull out sofa but when the slip cover came off the sofa looked as if a dog chewed on it because it was ripped in several places it also looked stained we are a family that likes to camp and this room was the worst than sleeping on the ground my husband was going to sleep on the couch but it was so disgusting we all sleep sidesays across the only bed it was the worst hotel
