i was staying at this hotel and became badly bitten by vermin during my stay there i ve contacted my physician directly the same day i left the hotel and he confirmed it i ve sent the message with the pictures with the marks at my body to the hotel and the person who answered me wrote that it was somewhere else i became bitten but not at this hotel nonsense as i ve got marks already the same day as i left the hotel and the pictures are dated i answered with the e mail twice where i asked for the contact details to the owners but still haven t got any answer being a property it is not acceptable in general the hotel has old furnitures textiles and carpets in the rooms building and hotel s cleaning crevice is not the best one as for example my room remained unclean last day i was staying at the hotel and obviously vermin and very poor customer care
