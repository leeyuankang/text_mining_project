the internet wasn t working in the rooms they claimed they were switching companies they gave us after day a box for the room to help out it was ok not great but much better than having to go into the lobby for wifi one front desk person was very unpleasant and should not be in the hospitality business the cleaning staff does a very mediocre job there was a small glass shelf in the bathroom with our items on it it was never cleaned or organized throughout our stay the cleaning staff takes up the entire hallway with their things each day forcing one to maneuvre around it in the narrow hallways toilet is separate from the sink and tub which is somewhat odd and uncomfortable
