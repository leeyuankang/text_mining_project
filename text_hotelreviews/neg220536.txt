the toilet is so small that i could not close the door when sitting totally claustrophobic the bath tub was dirty i could not use the shower tube it was only for decorating purposes the whole shower appliance was dirty and full of calc i did not use the bathtub as i would have liked it also clogged when taking a shower the room is very small for a star hotel it looks darker because of the blue walls furniture and doors are from heavy wood hard to use or push it is an old building which has been refurbished quite disappointed of a star hotel
