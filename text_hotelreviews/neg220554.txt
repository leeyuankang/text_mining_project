my room was a superior double room with a twin bed and a sofa bed that wasnt v comfortable it was a bit tight for a family of adults a child and a baby paid about per night which was a very high price for the hotel level but the booking was of free cancellation so was a little higher than normal hotel is said to be stars but feels like a star hotel actually wifi available but v slow in streaming was ok for browsing shower had no upper hanger u have to hold the shower head while showering the hotel elevator is very small to adults and a child would fit but hardly hotel breakfast for per person which is a bit expensive
