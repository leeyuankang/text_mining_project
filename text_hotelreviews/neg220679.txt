real pity that all hotel facilities except for breakfast are not available on fri and sat not even the bar was open room air cicrulation was poor either too warm or too cold despite the airco unit our room was also not made up fro three people as requested and we had to ask for a set of towels on saturday despite us being away for several hours our room was not made up and in the end we asked ourselves for replacement towels lighting in the room was also poor all in all not a bad hotel but too expensive for what you get it all comes across as a little pretentious
