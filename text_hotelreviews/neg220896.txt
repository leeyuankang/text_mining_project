reception we stayed for days but our room card was set only for day therefore we received the farewell sms on the first day and we had to go to reception and explained that we are staying for days instead of elevator the elevator was not in good condition for us which made a noice and it shook severely every time when it started to lift very noisy when it rained it was not possible to sleep when it was raining because the room is right next to iron roof top which made huge noises when it rained equipment there was no electronic kettle temperature problem we booked rooms together one room with air conditioning set at degrees was very hot but another room with degrees was cold it was not possible to lower the temperature we tried to open the windows but the problem is that the room is located just in the face of range hood which the smoke made us uncomfortable staff offered to turn off the air conditioning but it would be no air floating which we didn t like it all these elements made is an unpleasant stay
