we always make a short trip to paris in september and have stayed in quite a few boutique hotels but the rooms at the chess hotel were shockingly small we made reservations for the superior double room but it felt like what we would in england call a small double room there was only space for a bed and a long narrow side table to one side of the the wall right below the suspended tv also there needs to be more than one staff member in the evenings the poor man was in charge of manning the reception as well as attending to inquiries made by guests at their rooms and preparing the meals that may apparently be ordered from the hour dining service the hotel advertises we decided against ordering in room service when we realised he had to do everything by himself
