the only access up to the hotel lobby and rooms is through one lift at the end of a long thin corridor access to using the stairs is limited to leaving the building only this means you can be waiting a long time to get up to your rooms lobby some of the plug spots are so tight that once you plug in an adaptor your plug doesn t fit but there are quite a few plugs around the room although annoying this didn t hamper our stay or how much we liked the place
