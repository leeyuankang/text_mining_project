the morning afternoon staff mistaken my booking i booked two bedrooms connecting to each other but they gave me only room with bed i checked in very late in the evening so the midnight shift staff didn t really know about the booking already prepared by the morning afternoon shift he said but the midnight staff is very helpful though elevator is very small and only has to serve the whole building
