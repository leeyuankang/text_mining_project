i paid via booking online for my stay i was shocked that when i was checking out the receptionist asked me to pay euros tax when the initial amount i paid for the room is almost the same this wasn t mentioned anywhere when booking the hotel which was a bit disappointing there was no concerige service when i checked in had to carry my suitcases by myself which was inconvenient
