we were switched hotels at the last minute and no one notified us rooms were too small it s very likely they are the same size at all these same chains we had adults and a baby with a baby bed even without the baby bed there was hardly any room to walk through the room but we made it work however it was a nice place to stay in a decent location lancaster gate station underground was closed when we were there or that would have been nice also
