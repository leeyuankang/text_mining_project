the lifts in the morning get very busy as it is a business hotel they have plastic cups so you can take your tea and coffe on the go from your room but if you use them then you have no cups in the room to make a coffee or tea the snacks in the lobby are not good quality i tried a goat cheese sandwich and it was watery and not tasty
