on arrival room had a faulty toilet which was noisy i was told there were no spare rooms then suddenly there was a spare room and i was moved i had partially unpacked and was downstairs in the bar having a drink i was about to go out to dinner and the front desk told me they had moved my room again so there were spare rooms and they moved my belongings without asking me taking things from the wardrobe bathroom etc it was outrageous the manager was not in but dealt well with my complaint the next day i was moved to a much nicer room for the night and offered a bottle of wine
