we had water dripping from the ceiling in the bathroom the whole floor was wet i was fixed but we had to complain twice and the size of the room and the breakfast buffet did not justify a price of a night as well as the mini bar that was included in the price which had a small coke some ornage juice and water in it not really the minibar ur expecting when you re booking the room they also turned on the ac everday and cooled down to degrees c even though we turned it off again every day
