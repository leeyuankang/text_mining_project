stayed here years ago and it was a slightly old fashioned hotel with moody staff they have since refurbished many of the rooms and wrecked the old charm of the hotel it s still got the moody staff very unhelpful never even showed us to our room just said it was on the floor breakfast was per person for a croissant and coffee so we skipped that there are plenty of excellent cafes nearby where you can get better for on leaving the hotel we walked out having paid without so much as a goodbye from the staff all very odd
