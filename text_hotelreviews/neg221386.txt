i didn t like the fact that there wasn t any airconditoning at all when it was hot and humid during the days that i stayed there the reason being that it s normal in paris hotels not to turn on their airco units during the so called colder months however it was very sunny and temperature for first two days was over in addition to that i stayed at level and i could always hear the water flushing going down perhaps the plumbing in an old building is pretty bad it was very hard to go to sleep and i had to have my earphones on or put on the music to put myself to sleep very annoying indeed
