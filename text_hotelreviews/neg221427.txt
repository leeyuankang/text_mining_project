the hotel blocked double night payment on my credit card prior to my stay but this did not reflect in their system i was told that the extra amount blocked would be released shortly after we checked out well it still isn t further more i would expect more from the reception of a star hotel looks shabby one person on duty during the night shift not the most competent one although quite friendly did not like the location chinatown is chinatown wherever you go in general this should be stars sold at half a price they are charging we selected it because of the roof top pool a rare case for milan the pool is nice but a bit smaller in reality then it looks on the pictures sorry guys this is the said truth comparing your venue with other star hotels
