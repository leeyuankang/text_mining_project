the staff needs to be highly trained spent min checking out because they processed the wrong amount and could not understand what to do the hotel is new but star so the staff should be very professional since day one of the opening the check in was also too long which was disappointing as the travel time was long and we were tired car parking in hotel does not have enough space even when the hotel is not fully booked
