because the hotel is new there are certain things that still need to be worked on for example there was a wooden panel part of the wardrobe that fell on my feet because it was detached from the console stuff is great but sometimes get lost a bit with the simplest requests i am sure all of these small drawbacks is just a matter of experience and will be smoothed out in the future because the place is just superb
