after traveling three weeks in ireland northern ireland and scotland where we were happy with all our accommodations we were disappointed with our sofitel experience the room we were assigned was not adequate too small too dark and on the sixth floor when we specifically requested a lower floor after complaining we were offered a fourth floor room that had a strong musty smell in general for almost night pounds night we expected much better we stayed for two nights in a room that was too small and had a view of a cement wall furthermore the toilet didn t flush properly and the shower in the tub has a movable glass panel meant to keep water from going on the floor but the panel doesn t stay in place making the floor slippery we felt that here we were treated as second class citizens which certainly was the opposite everywhere else we stayed the person we primarily spoke to at reception was much too apologetic but offered no solutions
