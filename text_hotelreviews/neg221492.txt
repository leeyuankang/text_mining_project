we had breakfast one morning and were not impressed there was loads of choice but the cooked part of the breakfast which we mainly chose let it down the bacon was awful either barely cooked or very well cooked hash brown was over cooked one choice of egg scrambled toast left in the toaster which was nearly impossible to remove without a knife or burning fingers no butter although plenty of jam sausages were nice though
