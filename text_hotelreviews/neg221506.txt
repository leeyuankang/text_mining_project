the hotel suited us very well but i can find some downsides the breakfast arrangements with three different prices were annoyingly complicated a pre theatre meal in the bar was very poor and very expensive we had a slightly awkward room with a view overlooking what seemed to be ventilation shafts and air conditioning but it had good double glazing and was very quiet the shower head the tv and the blind required attention rather too many problems within the three days we were there even though they were dealt with promptly as we were staying for several days not overnight visitors i was surprised that i had to ask for the room to be cleaned as late as lunchtime
