had a very bad experience at the spa it s a star facility and i would expect a top notch massage my therapist was very inexperienced and it felt like she was always working an inch or away from where the pressure was supposed to be she failed to change anything despite me asking times to adjust the pressure and on top of that was sniffly all the time and wouldn t blow her nose when i asked instead of enjoying it i kept thinking i should stop the treatment and leave without paying because it was just unacceptable it was truly a horrible experience i gave this feedback to the management but have not heard anything back
