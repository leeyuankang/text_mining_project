we had two rooms one superior and one luxury room on the second floor both rooms were looking at the back side of the building and we had the airconditionning systems just in front of us to our room level if the curtains were open the only think we could see was the airconditionning machines and people from opossite offices could see in our rooms we could not even see the sky not adequate for a star hotel room in addition the superior room no was not sq meters as indicated in the booking com page but quite smaller i think that they should not give to guests rooms at that level unless the guests were notified about the above disadvantages
