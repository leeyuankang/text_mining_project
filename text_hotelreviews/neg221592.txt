the hotel is a very luxury one however there are serious problems in the hotel and my nights stay were not satisfying in my fist day after coming from a long day my room was not cleaned when i asked the housekeeping who arrive to the room around pm they replied that they had training and couldn t do the cleaning earlier this is very disappointing from such a luxury hotel in my second day there were a water leakage in my room coming from the bathroom during this time a staff member entered my room without my permission and he wanted to check the leakage what kind of privacy this hotel is giving to its guests in my forth day there were another water leakage this time the water stayed in the floor for one whole night until my check out time i arrived at the hotel at that night late and found a letter to give me to the option to change my room it was too late as i will check out anyways the next day i called the front desk in my last night to complain and they told me they will report to the duty manager in the morning who should contact me before my check out however no one contacted me at my check out i complained and asked to see the duty manager she came to me and when i told her about my issues she said there is nothing she can do what a bad treatment in a very expensive hotel and supposedly a luxury one in london i demand a compensation and apologies for this bad experience my last note is that i will not stay in this hotel again
