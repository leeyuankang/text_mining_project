the only complaint that i had was that although the room was fairly spacious there wasn t anyplace to put your suitcase there was a very small wardrobe about hangers and definitely not big enough for a suitcase even a carry on there wasn t even a chest of drawers so you had to live out of your suitcase but there wasn t anyplace to put it my husband and i each had our own suitcases so they were always in the way since we were basically pulling things out of our suitcase everything needed to be ironed and there wasn t even an iron in the room i am sure you could have gotten one from the front desk but i have never been in a hotel room at any level and not had an iron or a chest of drawers in there other than that the room was nice
