poor room view food was excellent in restaurant but surroundings setting could be better but assume that is down to lack of space the service throughout is excellent but in the restaurant the waiter was what i would describe as too keen he whipped plates away before one of us had finished eating which i was brought up to believe was bad manners etiquette and he was a bit pushy trying to get us to have a second main course
