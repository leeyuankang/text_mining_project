on arrival mid morning we were invited to eat to hotel as we had missed breakfast due to early flight we asked for some eggs toast and coffee the waitress said breakfast had ended mins prior but she would ask chef he refused to make it i don t think this meal was an unreasonable request and would not have taken mins not what i would expect from a star hotel and certainly not for the price we paid
