i was staying at the highest floor the room was nice but i would add some more detailes to make it more cozy looking like two little rugs at the sides of the bed would be perfect also the walls are looking quite cold and unattractive so i would put either the wallpaper on it or color it in a bit more warm tone so a few little details would make the room perfect also the water was leaking right on the floor while showering but it s quite easy to fix i think
