when i booked it said free cancellation and no pre payment needed a day or two later the holiday inn tried debiting my account times naturally it was declined as i had not authorised the debit i now incur those bank charges and bad debt reflection upon booking i specifically requested bath tubs in both the rooms i did not receive any response on this what i did receive was an email saying that if i didn t update the banking details with another card that could be debited then i would loose the booking i felt bullied by this and not wanting to loose the accommodation i authorised the debit when we reached the property we were told that the rooms did not have bath tubs and only had showers and that the rooms with the bath tubs were already allocated it is false advertising on your booking com website as the facility specifically showed a shower and a bath tub i would have cancelled the booking had i known this and believe this was very misleading by the hotel on a separate note breakfast was chaos there was only one poor woman running around and we had to wait for milk bread eggs juices etc for a while on both days we don t eat pork and aside from pastries and toast with eggs there wasn t much for us to eat there should at least be consideration and have either turkey or chicken sausages without containing pork in them as for the shower it had rotted at the bottom and we had to use towels to prevent the water from travelling into the bedroom i wasn t expecting to be housekeeping during my holiday there were also lots of ants in the room it was degrees and the air con didn t work we were exhausted from the day and didn t bother to call maintenance overall we felt like we had been deceived and ripped off i would really appreciate a response from one of the booking com consultants
