anything positive got overshadowed by the bedbugs unacceptable that this type of hotel has bedbugs we have bedbug bites i had one small bite in my hand i thought maybe a mosquito or something the second night when i got home i had a lot more i didn t know what it was and the doctor confirmed bedbugs and explained the bites can show a day after or so my sister and i got it since we slept on the bed my other sisters that slept on the sofa didn t get bitten this is just unacceptable we tried to reach the hotel and they hang up on us very unprofessional
