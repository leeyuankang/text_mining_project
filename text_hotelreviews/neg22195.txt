me and my sister stayed at holiday inn paris montparnasse pasteur unfortunately the experience was not as nice as planned on saturday the of april we noticed that someone at the hotel used a master key and entered our room and stole euro and pounds on friday night while we were out to the city we addressed the issue to the front desk as soon as we noticed that a crime was committed but the rudeness and lack of respect for a customer just shocked us so incompetent rude and arrogant staff i have never seen in my life instead of trying to help us girl at front desk was just showing attitude and was not even feeling sorry she just told us that the hotel is not taking responsibility for things like that when we asked to call the manager she said it is saturday and he is not at work and we should talk to him on monday when she knew that our stay is until sunday later she called him but the response from the manager was the same with the same rudeness and attitude a global company as big as the holiday inn can t even offer me money back from my room or a voucher to say sorry please don t stay here they are not safe not in control and don t care about customer s feelings or satisfaction our room was entered without us knowing that there is no care for safely i am just glad that i wasn t in the room by myself as i dread to think what would have happened customer service is below hotel management below never again staying at holiday inn
