we booked and paid for a deluxe room and on check in were told that there were non available so we were had to have a standard but the only difference were robes and slippers that she would get delivered to room we already had one set of robes and slippers in the room no extras were delivered also i think it s wrong to have done this and still charged us the same price i will send an email direct to the hotel
