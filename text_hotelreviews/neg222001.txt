we regrettably had a broken night s sleep on this visit due to an intermittent noise sounded like distant fireworks strange popping noises throughout the night and into the morning we didn t mention it to the staff during the night not really much point and as staying only one night wouldn t have wanted to have to move rooms in the early hours we did mention it to the receptionist on checkout and received an immediate apology and offer of free breakfast they were also going to send someone up to the room to check it so very good response to the problem
