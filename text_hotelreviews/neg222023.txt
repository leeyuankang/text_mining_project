staff were really friendly on check in however my room key didn t work and it took longer than i would have liked to rectify the original staff member who was with colleagues but no customers told me to wait for someone else who then suggested it was my fault for putting it next to my phone or something seriously i held it in my hand between the reception and the elevator just apologise and fix it don t fob me off onto another colleague and then make it out to be my fault
