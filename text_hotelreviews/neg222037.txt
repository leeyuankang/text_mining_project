wifi is not working in the room we are at the last room of the floor but it works when we are at the lobby when i told the staff in the lobby they just think i dont know how to set up and refuse to check the problem and after i come down several times and she gives me a tel no to deal with it i found it too troublesome and we just live here for nights thus didn t call the tel the air con always switched off automatically and in the mid nights we always felt cold and need to get up to switch on again
