no heating on in the room didn t get to bed until and the room was at freezing temp i wasn t told on arrival earlier in the day that i need to turn on the heating system in my room the maintenance man arrived and it still didn t come on until he requested his manager to resolve the heating problem the duvet was a summer version wafer thin so i didn t sleep for hours until the room heated up i had to put my coat on top of the bed because there were no spare blankets in the room we ordered bar snacks the night before which came an hour later barman under pressure and the snacks were cold my colleague found black hair in the bath and i found a long black hair on my pillow lovely this is my second time to this hotel the last time i was sent to a room that was empty no plumbing or carpet it was being refurbished i gave their staff the benefit of the doubt and came back i didn t report a complaint this hotel is not up to the standard i expect they gave me a free breakfast which was a small compensation i was tired and exhausted from not sleeping and i had more meetings the next day before getting a flight not happy
