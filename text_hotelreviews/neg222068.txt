the breakfast was stupidly expensive so we had breakfast at mcdonald s we had booked a room with breakfast included but when we got the confirmation email it was a double room for one person only so once that was sorted we found out there was no breakfast included we were so frustrated by this point we didn t try ringing back and just had the room for a lot more money than originally shown which i m guessing is because it was now for two people not one
