the card in the bathroom mentioned a lot of complimentary items such as razor shaving gel comb etc however we never saw them in the bathroom this was not a major problem since we had our stuff with us anyway yet i wonder why the management offered something when they didn t provide it the room had only two bath towels which is a bit difficult to deal with when one of the guests has long hair and thus needs two towels herself the management really ought to put in a couple of extra towels in the wardrobe
