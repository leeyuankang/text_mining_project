quality of the room was nothing special food was terrible poached eggs with my starter still had runny whites no one likes that burger was too hot to eat but the fries were only just warm how do they do that no table check in fact no service at all for over mins as the staff were too busy no drinks offered no puds or coffee offered i had to chase to pay breakfast was way over priced self service rubbish buffet style with everything cold half a cup of coffee offered after you get a better service at premier inn for a lot less why can hotels not go back to the days where a chef actually cooks your breakfast and it s hot this is the hotels last opportunity to impress a guest it s the last thing we remember they should make the effort would not use hilton again
