i did not specifically reserve a room with a wheelchair shower and bathroom set up when i arrived the staff person who checked me neglected to inform me this was the sort of room they were giving me the sink was impossibly small and low and there was nowhere to put my toiletries no matter whether you re standing or in a wheelchair the sink seemed too small the walk in shower was alright but it would have been nicer to have a bathtub the ac was also set to cool and it was not possible to change it to heat there was nothing in the mini fridge and room service was only available until p m with no vegan options
