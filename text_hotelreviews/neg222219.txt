we had a king room with executive room access which really was a waste of money either the non king rooms are tiny or the king room isn t much bigger than a standard also the executive room is a bleak room stuck on the back which is only open for restricted hours i also get irritated by hotels which don t replenish water tea bags etc for the second night when you pay the same for both nights we only had normal tea bags to start with which meant no tea on the second morning
