i was allocated a room from which another visitor had been moved before i checked in there was an empty complimentary biscuit wrapper on the dressing table and the toilet had been used but was unflushed there was also a wallet of tickets for the eurostar left on the dressing table which i brought down to reception and asked for them to be reunited with the previous occupier of the room who checked in on the same day as me and was returning home the following day
