i found the room too hot and could only turn the thermostat down to degrees breakfast was disappointing although the cooked breakfast which i didn t have looked good service in restaurant was poor and the layout of everything apart from the cooked breakfast was all around the room so difficult to find what was on offer if i was to stay again i would not have breakfast here
