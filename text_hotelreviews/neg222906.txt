the rooms are very small which is ok but not when the space is taken up by a huge desk i was going to store my case in the wardrobe but that had an ironing board in it being a bit more clever with furniture like a desk which folds down from the wall freeing up floor space and an ironing board built into the wardrobe would make the space much more pleasant to be in
