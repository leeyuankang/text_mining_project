did not expect to find blocked sink in bathroom when we arrived did not expect to find they want for a bottle of water most hotels provide free did not expect to find basic plates and items missing at breakfast and staff would not even get them poor breakfast selection not good value as we have done much better for less many times in london not very courteous staff
