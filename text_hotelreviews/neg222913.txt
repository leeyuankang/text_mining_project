the room we were in had horrible plumbing the sink and tub did not drain despite unscrewing the stoppers this meant leaving a mess in the sink if you did anything the housekeeping staff rewarded the mess by providing decreasing supplies each day the curtains which were over feet tall were missing hooks so you could not completely close them to block the light from the street at night or even to ensure privacy without using something to hold them in place and because of the height were not something you could fix yourself the hotel staff were not friendly helpful or welcoming the breakfast buffet had flies circling it and was definitely not worth the cost great location but not worth the money
