we booked a superior twin room when we received the email to perform a pre check in so as to save time when we arrived we did however when we arrived there was no designated queue for guests who have already checked in we had to queue in the general queue we were also asked about our room preferences when we checked in online we indicated our preference for a high floor but when we checked in we got a room at the ground floor near the toilets with no view the room was a tad too small for a superior room we were told that the only twin rooms they have in the hotel were at the ground floor besides security was not tight at all anyone could wander into the common corridor and outside our room in all we felt that the pre check in was redundant since we had to wait in line and if by booking and paying for a superior twin room meant no choice of room location and choice do not provide us with options like room near lift end of corridor high floor or low floor etc
