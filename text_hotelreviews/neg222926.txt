what could have been better the allocation of the complimentary drinks token i received one i presume as it was my first stay at the hotel and id signed up to their rewards offers but my brother who was also staying at the hotel is a black rewards member of the hotel chain but he didn t receive a drinks token because they d given one to me apparently when we questioned this they were confused because of the same surname and it took along time to explain yet when i had checked in earlier the reception staff had acknowledged that my brother and his wife had arrived there was no confusion then breakfast the pasties were stale which was a shame as there is an excellent cafe a couple of minutes down the road pauls where the coffee and croissants were excellent ah the coffee when our breakfast waiter came to ask about our order i asked if we could have two teas and a coffee he said yes and then proceeded to take the breakfast order my brother and his wife ordered the full english yet the waiter did not ask how they would like their eggs and exited quickly to place the order with the kitchen other waiting staff were asking their tables how the guests would like their eggs the teas and coffee never came so when i went round to select my breakfast continental i realised that there was a hot drinks machine this would have been a very simple explanation for the waiter to give instead of leaving us thinking that our drinks were on their way overall not a great experience for such a nice hotel especially when there are other options so close to the hotel and when those other options pauls amongst them provide a better service and better quality food
