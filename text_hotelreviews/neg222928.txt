breakfast we had continental no decent fresh uncut bread or rolls available to go with the cheese and meats only very ordinary sliced bread was offered good only for toasting no bagels or cream cheese for the smoked salmon the croissants seemed stale and bland cheap no plain ordinary water to be had unless i bought a bottle note most diabetics can t drink fruit juice the area around the cereals was so messy all together breakfast was a thoroughly unpleasant experience oh and please change your bar price list you sell water from harrogate note the spelling it is not spelt harrowgate you should change that
