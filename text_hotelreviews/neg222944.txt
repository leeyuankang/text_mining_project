the staff one gentleman in particular was rude and looked down his nose at us like we are somethin he stepped in i know this is kensington and everything but if i payed to stay in this hotel i expect to be treated with respect at least next issue is the lack of mention about this pre autherisation fee we travelled a long way to come to london with only a little to spend as tourists and then when we arrived we didnt expect to be forced to hand over just in case i might want to charge something to the room i didnt have the money in my bank account we wernt aware that we had to do this and when i told the rude man that i didnt have the money in my account he refused to let us go to our room that we had prepayed to stay in for one night my friend had to pay the fee which left her short of cash we were told that if we didnt charge anythin to the room at the end of our stay it would go straight back on her card to then find out when checking out that it will take a few days to be returned so our trip to london became abit difficult when your a visior on a budget we didnt get to do some of the stuff we came to london to do also i booked for a superior room just so i could have the breakfast included when we got to the room it was tiny i dread to think how small a standard room is if we got the superior for a star hotel its lacking its stars from my point of view and ive stayed in a few oh and one more thing the room wasnt very clean the tea making facillities were smothered in dust i have bits floating in my cups of tea it looked like nobody cleaned it for weeks even if nobody had used the facilities surely the cleaner has to dust the room soo grosss i would not recomend this hotel to anyone unless your rich and have just sitting in your account and like a snall room covered in dust
