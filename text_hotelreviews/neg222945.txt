the worst was the receptionist we explicitly asked whether the trains to the airport were running normally he pretended to looked in the system and assured us all was good having trusted him we arrived at the train station only to be told that that weekend due to planned works on the tracks no trains were running we scrambled to make it to the airport which cost us extra money and we barely made our flight he simply lied into my face which i find unacceptable
