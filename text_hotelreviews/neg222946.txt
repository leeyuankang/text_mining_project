we paid for an upgrade to full english breakfast and it really was horrible very greasy and not well cooked i couldn t eat it they also charged for four coffees which would normally be served as part of a breakfast price they took the price of these coffees and the breakfast upgrade cost off our bill which was good but i would have preferred to have a lovely breakfast there where some bottles of water next to the coffee machine in the room i presumed they would be complimentary but they were not this wasn t clear until we had the bill
