room too small staff were welcoming when we arrived but very poor customer service during check out wasn t asked how our stay was when departing how breakfast was would you like us to look after any bags during your last day surely this basic customer service skills breakfast was appalling took minutes before anybody even noticed we were there someone took our room number and told us to take a seat then it wasn t explained how anything worked we assumed he was coming back i had to go and ask for help where members of staff were just chatting at the bar we paid for the continental and hot breakfast at each continental was absolutely shocking warm watery orange juice warm full fat milk no semi skimmed milk left alongside a poor selection of cereal lack of breads muffins croissants cured meat no yogurt warm fruit no tea pots ordered our hot breakfasts the order came and was totally wrong also took around minutes to arrive really disappointing and should have just gone over the road to garfunkals for breakfast
