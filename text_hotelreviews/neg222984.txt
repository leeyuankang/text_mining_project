no elevator near the lobby very inconvenient for hotel customers esp if you have a big luggage and the service lift was located in a place where you can not find it easily the door is too heavy and the space inside is so small another downside of the hotel is they do not automatically replenish the the toiletries everyday after they clean the room you have to request for it
