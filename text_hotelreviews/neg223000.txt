well i couldn t open the window to get some fresh air into the room which is neither here or there the gym was a tiny broom cupboard in the basement and the tv wasent tuned in so assumed no one ever uses it a good job there was only me in there as there was no room as it was so tiny i thought the food in the restaurant was rather expensive especially breakfast so went elsewhere prices in the mini bar extortionate hallways and carpets all look a bit tired but it s a nice enough hotel all said and done and is great for a short london break
