the pillows on the bed were a little hard for our liking but we didn t see an option for softer pillows we had a street facing room which we asked for opposite a bank and apartments yet there where no nets on the windows to provide any privacy with the curtains open my side of the mattress was dipped in the middle continental breakfast could have had a little more choice but what was available was excellent
