i think for the money we paid i expected something a little better the executive suite set up is a bit strange the bedroom is in the larger room and then off to the side is the lounge from the description it sounded as though we would have a large lounge area and then a private bedroom which would make more sense we couldn t use the television properly the whole time because it said we were not checked in i called reception about this but the issue wasn t fixed the hotel looks nice from the outside and the lobby is ok but it needs a fresher look in terms of furnishings
