we were given a lower ground floor room underneath the bar room cold when we arrived so had to get maintenance to look at it the view was on to a set of steps to a basement the noise from people walking across the bar was considerable sounded very heavy and floorboards creaked we were told this would stop at but it went on until after also told that hotel was fully booked so we didn t really have any choice but to put up with it we were woken again at by more activity in bar cleaning crew no answer from reception when we phoned noise restarted again after not a very restful or romantic valentine s break
