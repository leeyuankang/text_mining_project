the only thing i d say that could have been slightly better was the friendliness of the hotel staff they were ok but maybe need a bit more chat to there customers also as i am a genius booking com member i had free late check out but i wasn t able to find out whether i could have this or not until the morning we were leaving which left us a bit uncertain with our day plans
