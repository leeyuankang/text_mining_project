having stayed at rydges before i was disappointed with the quality of the breakfast on this occasion no fresh coffee tea served at the table but only available from a self service machine very little fresh fruit with tinned peaches on offer even though it was july with plenty of seasonal fruit available bread was of poor quality mass produced pre sliced variety very disappointing
