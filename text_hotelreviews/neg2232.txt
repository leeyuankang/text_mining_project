our double bed was two twins pushed together and i kept falling into the gap bathroom was a wet room door kept catching on the shower rail door was damaged due to the damp nowhere to put toiletries or toothbrushes loo roll almost on the floor so got damp room was dark small had no mirror furniture was a bit worn looking i prepaid for our room months ago on an old bank card when we arrived at the hotel they wanted a copy of the card i paid on i no longer had this the staff member insisted that i paid again on a bank card that i had on me and that she would refund the original amount paid onto the old card i was very annoyed about this as there was no mention of having to bring the card i paid on after paying again on my only debit card it left me short for my husband s birthday weekend refund will take working days i had prepaid so far in advance so that i could forget about it and splash out a bit whilst in london my husband and i very rarely get a weekend without our children or the money to enjoy ourselves so this dampened the weekend for us
