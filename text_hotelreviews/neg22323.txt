the room is not only very small but mine on the sixth floor had a low ceiling giving me a claustrophobic feeling as some people mentioned in other reviews there are smells in the common areas it is hard to say with such old buildings where these come from the room was fine the staff does not tell you much about the hotel when you arrive i realised that there was a promotion for breakfast only by looking at the paper that comes with the key tv channels mostly limited to french tv i found this area of paris and the areas around the hotel very dirty
