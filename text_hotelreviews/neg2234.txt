i made the booking on behalf of my year old son i am concerned that having booked in advance and paid in full for the room on my visa debit card at check in my son was asked to re pay on his card and that i was to be refunded this practice is unacceptable as it is only by chance that my son has a card and also as a student there was enough money in his account to pay for the room having to make this unexpected payment caused limitations and cash flow issues for my son i had purposefully booked and paid in advance to avoid any complications in my mind there was to be nothing for my son to do except check in and enjoy his room prior to handing to heathrow airport the following morning please advise why this occurred and why this process is employed the reimbursement of my original payment is exceedingly slow it should be instant as monies being held for a period of time from both my son and myself is inadmissible helen jackson
