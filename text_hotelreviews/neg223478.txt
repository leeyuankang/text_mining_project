only downside was hotel staff were not accommodating when we arrived earlier than expected i understand it says the check in time but there was going to be a large cost for checking in minutes early luckily me and the mrs had packed our football boots so played a full game then headed in for post match showers jokes aside though i think this could be worked on a small negative on an otherwise excellent hotel
