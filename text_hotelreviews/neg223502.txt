it is slightly nitpicking but the bathroom had that musty smell associated with fungal infestation or poor ventilation the door had to be left ajar for several minutes to disperse the smell before use i did not notice any deficiency in the cleaners competence i suspect the problem is to do with housekeeping management and i suspect from other similar reviews it is a common issue which needs to be addressed
