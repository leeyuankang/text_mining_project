rooms are very small even by paris standards air conditioning was hit or miss so do not accept a room on floors or best room is large bathroom and larger room nicely decorated make sure you have your hard copy print out of your reservation and price in euros breakfast is not worth the price a fantastic bakery one block away and starbucks or mccafe blocks spend your time out of the hotel not in the cramped breakfast room open to the lobby plan checkout accordingly as taxis must be called ahead of time and the desk is totally unable to accommodate more than one person at a time
