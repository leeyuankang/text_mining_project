when i check in i thought i already made a payment through booking com when i booked it but it was my mistake and i needed to pay at the hotel the male staff was a bit arrogant to saying this which wasn t what i expect from a four star hotel but maybe he was more straightforward and this is a business hotel and that s normal but other than that all staff were nice and because of this is a business hotel no room has a bath tub only a shower i asked at the reception
