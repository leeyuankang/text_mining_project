i am used to being able to have coffee tea making facilities in the rooms and there were none so i missed my first drink of the morning but that seems to be the same all over france there are drink making facilities downstairs in the lobby room service you could take some hot water upstairs for hot drinks but it was cool by the time you got there and its not a good idea to be carrying hot water around hence the slightly lower score for facilities
