the staff was not very polite except at check in whenever i said good morning or good evening while entering the hotel the reception staff didn t reply also on one occasion when i asked for more details about checking out the person at the desk seemed bothered and wasn t very helpful this really surprised me and the overall impression was that they don t want guests except when cashing in
