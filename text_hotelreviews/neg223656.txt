the room we were given was a courtyard view the view didn t bother us we were out till late and checked out the next morning so we wouldnt have spent time admiring the view even if it was stunning however the room was so noisy i did not sleep much there is a constant loud noise like the sound of air conditioning running in the courtyard all night long the room window did shut with some persuasion but the double glazing does not stop the sound if you are bothered by noise make sure you ask for a room that does not look into the courtyard
