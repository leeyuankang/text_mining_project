the only negative was when i came to blow dry my hair i had to stand as there was no chair to sit on also as iam a hairdresser my hairdryer is powerful and as i was standing drying my hair the dust that flew off the top of the wardrobe was unbelievable it covered all our clothes on the bed so i don t think it had been dusted for a very long time so maybe the housekeeping needs to be addressed
