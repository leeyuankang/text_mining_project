there was a coffee bean in front of the microwave throughout our stay it must have been there when the previous guest occupied the room it always bothered me but i was out all day so there was just no time to talk to the staff about it honestly i just presumed hoped that it would be removed when the room would be cleaned but since that didn t happen i think the room was dirtier than it looked
