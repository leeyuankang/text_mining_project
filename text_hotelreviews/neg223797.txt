no restaurant was open for room service i wasn t told when booking or on check in that the restaurant wasn t open due to not being busy enough i paid for a superior queen room upgrade and was only given a standard double bed which was a very cheap rock hard mattress if i wasn t completely shattered and working in the building next door then i wouldn t have stayed there and travelled home to the other side of london
