personal preference but bed was a bit small for two very soft mattress with a dip in the middle breakfast available for continental buffet a bit more for cooked but when the bill was presented had been added for a service charge even though there had been no staff interaction except to say good morning and a space was then left to add an additional tip i m not averse to tipping but thought that was a bit ridiculous plenty of other options nearby
