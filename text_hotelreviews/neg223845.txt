booked through booking com for people sharing room when we arrived the booking had been passed to the hotel as max people they would have given us a bigger room and had the extra bed prepared in advance if booking com had passed on the information properly also we were charged for the extra bed where booking com led us to believe that the rate paid at the time of booking was for not the hotel s fault at all but i wouldn t book through booking com again
