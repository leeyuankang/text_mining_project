when entering the hotel and getting the information we needed we tried to use the elevator but had to be told by another guest how to use it aswell as guessing what floor we were on as this information was not told to us there was no where with a plug and a mirror in the same place to do my hair and make up our room was opposite the lifts which were in use all night they could clearly be heard from the room along with any passers by with trolleys from employees or just passing guests throughout the night the sheets felt and sounded like crunching paper the pillows and bed were rock solid the bed was to high up for myself and i am a young healthy female so i couldn t imagine what it would be like for people shorter then myself or not as athletic so along with the noise we did not get a much sleep i could not get from the bed to anywhere without having to fully climb over the bed as it was to close to the wall to walk round at employee tried to get into our room which my partner was at the time using the shower so i had to shut the door to stop them coming in i was not impressed as we had to be out the room at so what ever they needed could of just waited the room did not seem private at all to add to this the bathroom door was next to the top part of the bed which i felt was not the most hygienic place as you could step paces and there was the toilet seat it should of been opposite the bed or just a little further away when we booked the room it stated an iron would be in the room but it wasn t the pictures that were on the room when booking were obviously much bigger rooms free wifi where there was nothing around the hotel or in the room about it so we did not want to ask if you can help it don t stay in room
