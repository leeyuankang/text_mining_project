shower curtain was a bit terrible looked extremely cheap and after using the shower water was all over the floor quilt was very heavy but the biggest disappointment was the fact that air conditioning was very loud and even when set on lowest level it was blowing very hard and i couldn t turn it off cos i would turn off heating as well and winter in london is not warm at all
