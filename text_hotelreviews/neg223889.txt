behind the wonderful old facade are small modern rooms very stuffy it s actually hard to breathe as a result you need air con all the time but the air con is directly onto your bed face got sick overnight due to this hotel solution was to turn the air con off which then meant you couldn t breathe needs a total redesign would never stay there again
