i really didn t like the fact that although the sheets and pillow cases were clean the quilt had a cover on it that was designed to be reused by multiple guests the thought that the cover wasn t clean and had been used by other guests wasn t nice even if there was a sheet between me and it i wouldn t stay at this hotel again unless they change this
