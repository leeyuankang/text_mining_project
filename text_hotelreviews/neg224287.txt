misleading advertising we ve booked a room for adults kids and year old for nights through booking com when we checked in the front office staff informed us there was no room for people it is your fault and booking com as we don t have this option however in booking com we ve specifically asked for hotel options with capacity we suggest the kids share the single bedroom it was so outrageous and disrespectful after complaining and discussing we were told they would make an exception by adding one more extra bed as a favour as the booking was wrong both room and bathroom are much worse than you expect from the hotel website very disappointing experience don t recommend this hotel
