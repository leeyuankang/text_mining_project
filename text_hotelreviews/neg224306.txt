the bathroom door is a sliding glass door which is not great for privacy also our room did not have a safe we had a room to the back facing a wall offering no view at all and only indirect access to daylight this wasnt t a problem for our short stay as we were mostly outisde and they did offer us a chance to try to change rooms later
