while booking i picked a room with a balcony and paid extra but on arrival i ve been told that there is only rooms at the whole property and both are occupied the lady at the reception agreed to transfer us to a room with a balcony on the following morning as someone was vacating it and as a courtesy we have been offered a free breakfast the temp room we were accommodated for the night was bit on the small side and wasn t very pleasant as there was strong smell of mould i was annoyed by the gap of the toilet see pic s and the bathroom doors don t know it might be a french thing but i like my privacy while i m on the toilet seat anyway after moving to the balcony suit the next morning everything was fine the room was bigger as well
