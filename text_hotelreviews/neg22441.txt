i have chosen this hotel for my short holiday staff was unhelpfull and unkind my mum left her charger in our room we came back after hours staff agree for checking the room but it was already clean and there was no charger inside moreover cleaning staff entered the room without knocking staff is terrible hotel is cozy but staff is counter advertising
