sadly i felt the room was too small for the price no little kitchenette not much space to really breathe for a couple the bathroom was also difficult as there was only a bath tub with no shower or glass panel in order to have a shower you would have to be extremely careful not to flood the bathroom which i accidentally did when washing my hair whilst i always loved the look of this hotel and feel the property is lovely i was let down by the star rating price room size bathroom issue could be better for a single traveller on business
