i had higher expectations for this hotel based on the reviews and pictures the rooms were exceptionally small i know that s to be expected in europe but i ve traveled extensively throughout europe these were closets the bathroom was the size of a cruise ship cubicle the luggage took up the walking space completely around the bed breakfast was very expensive for what was offered for i expected a few more selections the hotel boasts a marie antoinette theme but other than a couple of pictures in the lobby the rooms named after historical figures of that period there was nothing special about the decor definitely paid a fortune for the location only
