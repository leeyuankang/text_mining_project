original booking requested a double fold out bed our first room offered was only a single the hotel was dirty and quite damaged and dated needs a refurbishment the pool rules were excruciating and tedious correct trunks and cap must be worn and the overall set up was poor cleaning equipment by the pool and unused gym equipment stored in the corner
