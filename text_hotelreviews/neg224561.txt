the last morning a cleaner walked in without knocking apparently presuming we had left for my wife who just had come out of the shower that was not pleasant we complained but the management just said that it cannot have been that bad and basically did not seem to realize that that it might be a problem if a man walks in when a women just comes out naked from the shower they thought we should have locked the door but as in all hotels the door obviously only opened with a key and we for one would normally not lock it from the inside for safety reasons in case of an emergency to summon up it was generally a good hotel but this experience was totally unacceptable and we would not recommend anybody to stay here
