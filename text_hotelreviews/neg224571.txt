initially we did not get the kind of room we booked since the hotel was completely packed so we had to do with a smaller room later the room was flooded due to leak in bathtub and had to change the room at midnight of the first day moreover the hotel staff present at that time on call was least bothered or did not try to help in finding a suitable room where we could move after arguing at the reception desk other staff helped and got us a room in another floor with no view moving room with family from one floor to another at midnight is not fun for sure when you are already tired of driving hours and a walk in the city over that multiple visits to the reception to sort out the room issue was not pleasant either while the parking space is ample the lift from the basement does not work with the key cards provided this made us wait for long since we have a child on a baby pram it was difficult to use the alternate escalator from the front of the hotel but we were there during easter and must admit that the hotel staff were overwhelmed by the tourist rush some really tried out of their way to help and accommodate
