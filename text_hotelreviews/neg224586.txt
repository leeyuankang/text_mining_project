no lifts to get from main entrance to reception floor we had a pram and we had to bring it via elevator a few times we used lift for disabled people but in order to get it working you need a staff card but there is not always staff around and you also need to go through the back doors and carpark to get to that lift swimming pool was very outdated and cold it is also a bit of walking to the swimming pool so its not great if you have to walk with small kids as we did
