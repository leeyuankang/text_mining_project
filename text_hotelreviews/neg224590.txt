there is an issue with the bathrooms water damage was very evident from leakage through the shower door onto the floor baseboards carpet enough that we had to change rooms the staff was very accommodating but two other rooms had a similar issue including the room we changed to toilet is separate from the bathroom i would recommend a hand sanitizer option you must return to the toilet off the bedroom to wash sofa bed mattresses need replacing springs were prominent and uncomfortable for my daughters a little more decoration e g photos of paris monuments or scenes would compliment the contemporary and neutral decor not a complaint but a suggestion based on similar type properties i m used to as a business traveler tv monitor was updated but interface was slow
