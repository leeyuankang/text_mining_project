had to change to a different room as the first we were given was on the floor had wet carpets and you could smell the damp i m not sure how long it had been empty but it must have been more than a couple of days overall the carpets in both rooms as well as the corridors looked a bit worn dirty and in need of replacing toilet was separate from bathroom and not ideal
