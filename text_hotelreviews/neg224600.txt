the location is ok good for tourists who want the eifel tower right around the corner but always consider some walking to the next metro station and some changing to get to places like louvre hotel de ville and so on annoying was the noise and bass from the club or whatever on saturday night at that was bothering i tried to call the reception twice for some other reasons and never got an answer furthermore the staff at the reception always seemed a little overwhelmed and too busy at check out they were not responsive at all to my attempt to complain about the nightly club noise
