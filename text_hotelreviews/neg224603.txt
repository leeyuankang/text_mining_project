i didn t like the fact that hotel staff charged my credit card before i actually arrived to the desk i didn t had that card with me and there was a problem first of all i want to have a full control over my cards and hand permissions myself i wasn t late this never happened to me before hotels usually wait for customer arrival and i do always use different cards for safety reasons but thankfully it was sorted smoothly paris some tourist areas is being close between on sunday for car traffic which blocks all town avoid those hours to drive
