checking in took an hour and a half as the receptionist was trying to tell us that they had no notification of the rooms we booked via booking com they then found it and slowly checked everyone in they then tried to tell us that they had no booking for a table for for dinner which was prepaid in full a very tiresome person who was very unhelpful and let the hotel down breakfast too again was fraught as booking com gave no option to book for breakfast so we came down expecting to pay and was met with the same sullen faces who eventually found somewhere for our people to sit and take breakfast the hotel was great in all other aspects once you get past the staff
