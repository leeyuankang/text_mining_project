i was very annoyed that my room internet didn t work for the duration if my stay considering i was there for business first i was told i can sit in the lobby which had no privacy and work which i found most inconvenient as i was working late then i was only asked if i wanted to move rooms a couple days before i left which didn t help i didn t have the spare time to move rooms this was very inconvenient i would highly recommend this is looked into the breakfast was limited in choice also when my taxi arrived for my departure i didn t get any help with my bags it would have been nice as i had more then one suitcase
