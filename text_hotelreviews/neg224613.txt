the reception area is spacious modern and the staff welcoming the rooms are a different story altogether we were a family of four the first room smelt of cigarettes we were moved to an alternate room the carpet was heavily stained and old pieces of fruit grapes and apples under the bed was disgusting the bathroom was appalling mould on the ceiling the mirror was falling off the wall the shower door closed but when you had a shower the water leaked to leave the bathroom like a swimming pool the rooms in this hotel are in need of some serious modernisation
