booked a family room was given a really small room with no room at all for luggage we asked to upgrade to a bigger room they charged for this the room we were upgraded to was dirty there were crisps on the floor from a previous occupant the sofa bed had slats missing and was very uncomfortable so our daughter had to sleep in the middle of us the breakfast was the usual continental food ok but not brilliant reception area lovely but rooms in dire need of updating not worth the money also to be aware that parking is onsite but is per day
