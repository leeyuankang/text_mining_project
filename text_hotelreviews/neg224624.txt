lady who showed us to breakfast table not very friendly another guest asked her if there was any more breakfast tea and she said no even though there was plenty when i gave the tea to the member of staff and asked her to pass them to the guest she refused saying she couldn t recognise her even though it was only mins since she had been asked i then walked around the restaurant and found the guest myself the member of staff saw this and gave me the blackest of looks she seemed to have the attitude that she was not there to help only to stand and look important having written this all the other staff members were lovely and very helpful especially the check in staff who we kept seeing as you had to go there for towels for the pool would be so much easier if towels were stored at the pool and you didn t have to wait with people who were checking in and out the hotel was lovely but at euros per night quite expensive epically as it was so far from the centre and required a train ride each day though perfect for the eiffel tower suprised by advice for versailles this was to buy tickets in advance for euros at versailles it is only euros and the audio guide is free hotel said this would be euros extra think you need to check the travel company you deal with on this very high mark up on price
