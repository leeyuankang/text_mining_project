it wasn t a star hotel the room was pretty small but for paris standard i guess it was an ok room but for exemple no room to leave my suitcase couldn t close the toilet door cause my legs didn t fit etc also trash was borken holes in the towels pretty noisy could hear the neighbors talking had the fire alarm twice during my stay extremely early because something burnt in the kitchen wifi was very poor breakfast very poor too very small breakfast room so i guess no room to display food so limited choice came late twice during the week and door was closed and had to wait a long time before someone opens the door they say but none at reception and had to buzz for minutes before someone comes to open the door location was excellent and staff was great especially the girl at front desk but definitely not worth paying the price
