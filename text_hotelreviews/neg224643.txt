i do stay in this hotel because my japanese colleagues want to stay here and they stay here because this hotel used to be the paris nikko hotel there is no comparison when it was the nikko nowadays this is just the average novotel but with a price tag that is not justifiable for what you get it s a run down place with s styling elements that i will try to avoid for my next trip to paris an annoying thing was that breakfast could not be added to my room bill and should be paid on the spot
