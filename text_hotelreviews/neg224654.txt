main reason for booking this hotel was for the indoor pool traveled with teenage boys who would rather swim than see another museum well the pool is for swimming laps not playing in and the boys were not allowed to wear their swim shorts they would have to purchase the tight swim briefs and a swim cap the only other problem we had was the shower it had a shower door and the entire bathroom was soaked after anyone showered very poor design
