too many annoying things in the hotel you can expect the room service guy at your bed at any time as they don t knock the door the door has no lock system to lock the door so for any reason if you forgot to put the don t disturb sign you will find him inside you can t shut off the tv if you have msg from the reception until you read it expect the tv to turn on by itself at night
