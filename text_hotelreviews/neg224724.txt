we felt mislead with the picture from online the room that we selected from on line is not the same as when we saw it it is substandard for the price we paid the chair was dirty the desk drawer was broken there were lots of stain marks on the floor the baseboard was dirty we had paper and plastic cups to drink how are we supposed to drink our bordeaux wine nothing in the fridge other than a single bottle of small evian water no toiletries when asked for a room transfer the front desk staff a guy was rude and non apologetic for our inconvenience overall it was bad experience and booking com has the responsibility towards us i could send you pictures of the room if you wish or i can post it on facebook
