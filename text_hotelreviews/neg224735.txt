the room is old and ugly the ceiling in the bathroom is kind of disgusting the bed seemed to be broken on the left side it made a loud noise every time my husband got out of the bed the accommodation is definitely not the level of a four star hotel last year i stayed at novotel in berlin which is by far nicer cleaner and more beautiful this hotel was quite disappointing
