i thought the rooms would be bigger as i reserved a room for three people but the room was too small for people reception very slow elevators are a mess carpet in the rooms are not very clean the shower in our room leaked water all over the floor also the tv didn t work the entire time we were there i reserved a room for people but they only offer towels for pity as i used to like staying at the previous nikko hotel
