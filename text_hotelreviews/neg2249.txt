the receptionists were not polite their english wasn t even that good to begin with the room was very tiny you could barely pass by the bed if i was a bit fatter i wouldn t be able to pass the bed sheets were not changed since day one there were stains the toilet was so tiny and the shower was horrible there is no way to shower without drowning the entire toilet the location wasn t that great and it took us a while to get in and out of the area
