very noisy rooms you can hear every noise in the hallway very tiny hallways there is nothing like waking up to a trolly hitting you door at full force because it was exhibition season i paid the price i paid before however this hotel is not worth euro a night breakfast area is way too small people crammed into and as the kitchen is open all the time you hear every sound that is made there not so pleasant to eat your breakfast with the noise of garbage bags being filled and employees complaining at eachother lack of decorum of breakfast personnel unworthy of stars safe can only hold a laptop of inch or less
