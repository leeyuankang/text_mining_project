while the room was no more than square feet occupied mostly by the king sized bed the most upsetting situation i experienced was with a front desk person on duty thursday at around pm who treated me in the most disrespectful of ways i arrived after a very hot days work at the paris air show in need of cold water when i asked this person for ice he said the hotel had no ice and if i wanted some to go buy it i told him that the night before the attendant kindly gave me ice from a back room in the breakfast area which he dismissed condescendingly insinuating i wasn t telling the truth one upsetting experience unfortunately overshadows the other people and effort made by the hotel to be a welcoming place
