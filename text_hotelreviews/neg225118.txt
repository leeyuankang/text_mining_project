the heat ac was not really on point we were always either really hot or really cold the service was not great either one night we came back to the hotel around and had to ring the bell times i even had time to look for the hotel s number and start calling when the half asleep security person apologetically opened the door at check out the person was super awkward and took forever to call a cab and give me my bill he also put any room number when calling in the cab which charged us euros for pre booking should start considering uber p which made for more awkwardness when the driver had to come in and ask the clerk with the counter running cause he didn t believe the cab was for us all in all it was our best hotel experience so far in paris just could use better staff
