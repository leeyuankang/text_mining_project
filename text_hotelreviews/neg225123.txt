bad air conditioning no air movement it would be bad if it is summer cuz the room is stuffy we are told by the receptionist on duty that we need to pay euro if we use hotel printer to print over pages but the tunisian receptionist told us next day that it was free of charge hope the hotel can have a uniform rate card to avoid confusion and keep your good reputation
