a man at the desk asked us if we had taken the riverboat ride on the seine and strongly suggested we buy tickets from him for euros a piece we told him we had family at another hotel and needed to check with them he became a little too insistent for my comfort trying to sell us tickets for everyone we did go on the cruise and enjoyed it but our family bought the tickets from their hotel for euros per person
