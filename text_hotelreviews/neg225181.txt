at check out i was charged euro s for breakfast however a guest checking out before me had the same room charge but breakfast included on my question to the front desk clerck on how this was possible i got the reply that the other guest booked directly through their website breakfast included and i had booked through booking com and therefore had to pay extra for breakfast maybe something to look into by the booking organisation
