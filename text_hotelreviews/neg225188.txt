in order to enjoy a more spacious room i treated myself to a deluxe room instead of at checking in the room did seem rather small but upon my request i got secured this was the deluxe room i had payed for only at home i realized that in fact i did pay for a deluxe room but was given a smaller superior room this made me feel quite disappointed with the hotel
