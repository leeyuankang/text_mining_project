it is a bit expensive but realistically you d spend the difference on travelling to the locations and the perks of this hotel is it easily accessible from everywhere and has so much stuff nearby that it is definetly worth it but i m only a student so to the average person it s reasonably affordable aswell as this they provide free mini bar etc so in all honesty there s nothing i didn t like
