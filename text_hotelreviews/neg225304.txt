it states the wifi works ever where but my self and my friend had a lot off difficulty getting connected and using it on the floor especially in our room if we wanted to use wifi we had to go to we re the food is served to sit although we found it worked perfect everywhere else we did find it disconnected it s self a number of times so we had to constantly ask for the wifi password as it is different each time i also found on the website it states a price you pay at hotel once we arrived we didn t it until the end and it was extra which was for the cleaning of the room and bedroom tax which i thought it should ve been inclusive in the price as it doesn t state anything on the booking confirmation
