when we arrived the room we were given was small and dark and smelt strongly of disinfectant we had to upgrade to a bigger and better room the receptionist was lovely and very helpful on this aspect the room we were then given reached a star standard but cost an extra euros per night because our room had not been ready on our arrival the receptionist reduced this amount this is the first time we have been so disappointed in a booking com hotel
