this hotel could be excellent but is let down by the finer details stains on bedding not changed for days no more toiletries provided after we used them first day no more refreshments after first day tv didn t work properly grout chipped away from the shower flooring water doesn t drain in shower so you stand in inches of dirty water all petty in the scheme of things this is a really good hotel but for the price should be better
