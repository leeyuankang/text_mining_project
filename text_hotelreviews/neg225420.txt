this should not put anyone off staying here as we will definitely book again these points are mainly for feedback for the hotel however there were a few niggly things like reception very busy staff were struggling a little and it took a long time to check in room door key card very temperamental only after sticking the card in times did it work some of the cups and mugs weren t washed on any of the nights that we stayed there the lock on the bathroom door handle kept coming off room service did not collect the tray when we phoned them so the dirty plates remained outside the door there was no hot water on the floor for the morning of my meeting so had a cold shower still trying to sort out the payment as it was taken off incorrectly however they are helping me room was a little small and had a balcony which we couldn t go out onto parking ticket didn t work once validated to stay current us to come and go as we needed to so got stuck at the barrier
