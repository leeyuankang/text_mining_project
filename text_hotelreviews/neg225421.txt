interestingly i was able to use my diners club credit card to pay for drinks breakfast etc but it was not accepted as a guarantee at the reception so i was not able to charge anything to my room whilst most of the staff were fantastic there was one day where the guy responsible insisted on personally seating everybody at breakfast since he was alone this led to a minute queue to get into breakfast most europeans are quite capable of finding a table and seating themselves
