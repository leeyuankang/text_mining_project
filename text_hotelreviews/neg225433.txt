i did not like the policy of taking both my british debit card and my euro master bank card and removing the money from my euro account for days when i had specifically asked them not to do so upon leaving i was informed the money would be refunded i paid on checking out with my uk debit card i object to the intervention in my euro account this is bad practice and i shall not return there because of it
