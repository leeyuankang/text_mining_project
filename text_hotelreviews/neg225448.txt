i only stayed in a regular room once and i will never do it again although the main bedroom was clean the bathroom was a disgrace room if i remember correctly it was a straight tile floor it felt looked like a public shower it also smelt bad due to having no ventilation i e leaving all the dampness after a shower the hotel can be slow to answer the phone or not answer it at all it takes a few attempts i even sent them a comment on twitter to complain about this because i had to call the hotel after i checked out but nobody answered the phone after keeping me on hold for minutes it just hung up they need to fix that otherwise the staff are great
