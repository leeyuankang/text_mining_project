when we arrived we were given a room which was very noisey it had large ventilation vents just outside the window we asked several times to change rooms it was only after we asked to speak to the duty manager that we got a response then we were given a quiet room we wanted dinner in the hotel restaurant but were told it was fully booked that evening it was not fully booked they had closed it laid up for breakfast we were told to eat in the bar but there was a football match on so it was very noisey we went out to eat when we got back the card for the door did not work so we had to go downstairs to get that sorted the staff hardly spoke english repeatedly misunderstood what we were saying the location of this hotel is good for kew gardens but i would not go back to this hotel as the service was poor the price for the room was high
