the hotel looked worrisome from the outside exterior needs updating there is an arresting smell of oud in the lobby a milder fresh scent is more desirable in my opinion there is a general lack of warmth in the hotel it would not hurt if reception staff were more friendly the rest we encountered apart from the staff mentioned were sullen and did not seem like they enjoyed their job the shower temp was a bit iffy but resolved after repeated tweeking
