the staff wasn t very friendly i forgot cards in the room and i wrote an e mail asking that they send me my cards home to date i have not received a response whether my cards were found and whether it is possible to send them to me this is not acceptable for a hotel the room was very loud and the bed was too small for people and not very comfortable
