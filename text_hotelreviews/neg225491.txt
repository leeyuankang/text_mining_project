we ordered two coffees in the bar area at about am we were asked to sit down and someone would bring them over very good idea it took nearly half an hour before they arrived and then only after a reminder the reason was obvious there was only one person on the bar the till was at the opposite end of the bar to where she was serving drinks and making coffee and the bar area was busy with people wanting drinks the queue should have been obvious to the three people manning the near empty reception desk
