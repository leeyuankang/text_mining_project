when we first entered our room we found out that mirrors weren t cleaned properly as well as the sink and the kettle the sink was too small and the tap was too far away and i cannot wash my clothes properly the design of the washroom was weird because everything was squeezed and next to the wall while the washroom itself was quite big the hotel was closed to the train station however it takes time to travel to the city center around half an hour
