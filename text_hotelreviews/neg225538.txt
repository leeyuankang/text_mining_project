check in a little awkward i was early and had to wait in the bar no problem however guests arriving after me were given room keys had to ask manager who explained some rooms weren t ready but i could look at one that was which we ended up staying in as it was perfect maybe the receptionist moody harried by ringing phone could have offered this level of service other than that minor detail this hotel is exceptional and the location perfect
