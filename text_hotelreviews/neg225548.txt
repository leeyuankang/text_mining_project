we booked to stay in a deluxe room but was persuaded to upgrade to an executive room and charged more which had not been explained fully we thought the total additional amount was and not per night the piece of paper we were given stated best possible available room and did not confirm it was an executive i am not sure i would have paid the extra as the room was not as good as the deluxe room that had been pictured when i booked with bookings com and it had no hotel literature or information in the room the carpet was also not too clean
