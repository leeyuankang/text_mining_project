fire alarm went off for no more than seconds before switching itself off i assumed a mistake or a test at no time did any hotel staff try to inform guests on my floor that it was actually a real emergency as is common practice in all other hotels i have stayed in only when i looked out of the window some mins later that i realised that guests from other floors were outside with a fire engine once i left the room there was still no fire alarm but when making my way downstairs using the fire escape i could hear the fire alarm on all other floors total shambles from poorly trained staff fatalities could have occurred due to lack of basic training will never consider using clayton hotels ever again
