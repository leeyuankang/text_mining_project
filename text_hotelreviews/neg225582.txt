the only issue i had was the heating which was virtually non existent the room had some sort of air condition in it but despite the fact that i was constantly increasing the temperature cold air was kept coming out i tried switching it off but it kept turning on on its own for some reason which was rather annoying i mentioned this at the reception they said they were going to look into that but i think they never did it s slightly ironic but it was much warmer in the corridors outside the room than it was inside the room the management at the hotel really needs to have a look into the heating issue as many times i overheard other guests complaining about that too
