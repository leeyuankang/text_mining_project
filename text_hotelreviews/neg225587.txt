i booked the hotel months in advance being aware that it was free parking one of the main reasons i booked it with them then when i got there i was left with a nasty surprise had to pay parking for two nights which accumulated which is scandalous considering you pay to stay at the hotel as well i was never informed that parking had changed and you now had to pay for it i asked reception and they told me it changed a week ago fair enough but considering i booked it before it changed i should ve been informed or been given free parking
