i paid to check in by and had to wait until to actually go to my room the staff kept telling us more minutes and could not keep their promise because of this our other plans were either delayed or even cancelled very unprofessional the room itself was quite disappointing the sink was clogged and there was no way to open the window to let some fresh air in resulting in an extremely dusty room our clothes were full of dust by the time we left and we only stayed night we informed the reception about the clogged sink we were told someone is on their way but nobody ever came very bad experience and not worth my money
