the receptionists are not professional their english is not very good and are not welcoming one thing that i didn t liked in the room is that i don t understand at this price and with a coffee machine in the room why they don t give every day some capsules for coffee i ve had two nights accommodation and one coffee for each adults it s a shame you need to look at that machine and not to have coffee to make one or maybe you need to ask for some and pay extra
