room very small in corner location sink holding water fixtures and fittings very worn room cleanliness poor during the night the fire alarm activated and we had to exit to the muster point we were met by a large group of drunk barnsley footballers and supporters but no hotel fire marshall after some time we returned to reception and had to find a member of staff who told us a call point had been smashed but that this was malicious the fire brigade did not attend and no apparent check was made of the hotel to ensure there was no fire a presumption was made that it was a false alarm
