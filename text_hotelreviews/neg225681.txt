everything else i ordered room service for dinner but as soon i finish dinner i had a massive belly pain and spent a lot of time in the toilet when finally was able to sleep the fire alarm goes on believing it was a really fire going on i covered baby in a towel and left the room in a hurry surprise surprise it was not a real deal it was told to me that a guest press the fire button however had to wait until the staff let me go to the room again buy by the time i went to the room baby was already awake took me a couple of hours more to be able to put him back asleep around i finally was able to go sleep in the morning i find that baby is having block nose and a nasty cough overall when i pay a hotel room i am expecting to receive a calm stay to release the stress and worries in my life did not happen with this hotel at the check out they didn t charge me the room service but i am not convinced to return
