the mirror in the bathroom is too high and a bit too far away behind the stone ledge there is no clock in the room the bathroom is huge but there is no tub the towel rack is far from the shower it should be located within reach from the shower when i check in they placed a hold on my credit card for more than the room rate and charge to the card local currency and not without checking with me or telling me how much they have hold i only realized after receiving a notification from my bank i checked with them the next day and was told they will cancel the hold and charge me the correct amount upon checking out i left and was back a week later same thing overcharge me without even bother telling me when i check out i expect them to cancel that and charge me for the rate that i have booked but instead i was told that i have already paid i can just leave if i didn t insist that they cancel the hold and charge again i believe i will be charged the initial amount held again they charge me in local currency instead of without bothering to check with me when i request for an invoice i was told that i have booked through agent and no invoice will be given which is not true the room is nice and location good but the service leave a lot to be desired in the middle of the night it can be very noisy i can hear people talking very loudly and also heard the roaring engine of racing cars bikes speeding through the streets
