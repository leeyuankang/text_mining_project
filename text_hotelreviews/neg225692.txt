the only breakfast option was a big buffet and it would have been nice to have an option to grab a quick coffee and muffin it was also very difficult to have any attention from the staff to order an espresso or latte rather than american coffee or to have a second coffee if you are interested in a full breakfast the options are quite diverse and it is possible to order something from the kitchen if you can get the attention of the staff
