booked a triple room which turned out to be a double room and an extra mattress was bought in which left no floor space should not of been advertised as a triple room even though a triple room was booked it wasn t set up for us and the whole booking in process took ages and ages and then we had to leave the room while the extra bed was put it not great when you are tired after a long journey we were show a twin room which had even less space to put the extra mattress so the double room with single was the best option if three friends were travelling together they don t want to share a double bed
