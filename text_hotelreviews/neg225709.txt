i booked a suite and it wasn t a suite is was a luxury large room with king size bed so very very misleading i also don t like this ludicrous habit of having one set of towels in the bathroom and having to look for another set which is hidden in the wardrobe why when it s a double room it s not trendy or stylish it s stupid and unnecessary
