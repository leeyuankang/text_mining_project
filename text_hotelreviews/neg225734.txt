i booked this hotel because it was close to a wedding reception that i was attending the added attraction was the website told me that the bar would show all major sporting events on its tv england vs ireland six nations fairly major not only was it not on but the bar was undergoing major refurbishment and was closed the hotel did seem to look like a building site and at for one night room only i certainly didn t feel i was getting value for money i did mention this when i was checking out and was told that if i come again and tell them of my disappointment i would be upgraded not sure i ll be going again
