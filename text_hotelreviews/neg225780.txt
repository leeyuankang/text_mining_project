unfortunately the night we stayed wasn t pleasant at all we had a large group of teenagers who had rented two rooms one opposite and next door to our room doors and loud voices were heard all night and it took the hotel staff till in the morning to finally kick them out this really ruined the stay for us as we had no sleep whatsoever it didn t feel like value for money and took the shine off what could of been a lovely weekend stay
