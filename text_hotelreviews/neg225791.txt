went to restaurant for breakfast and lots empty tables but not one was cleared restaurant looked filthy breakfasts we saw being served looked poor especially for the price so we got a refund and went for breakfast on the high street never had a problem getting a refund on the breakfasts which was good no parking there but not sure if was because having work done
