no parking but the web site said that there was parking if i had know there was no parking i would not have booked the shower did not work at all and it was very difficult to get a ready for the event that i had travelled to the reason for my stay the receptionists tried their best and did find me somewhere to shower in the end in another bedroom that i could use just for the shower before the next guest booked into it they were fully booked and i could not move rooms the key cards did not work all the time and i had to keep getting it reprogrammed and no it was no where near my phone when i spoke to the manager he really was not interested and wanted to know what my solution would be as if it was for me to resolve and finally once checked out i could not get to the pick up area to collect my bags as the laundry van was blocking the front entrance for about minutes in an area that is crawling with traffic wardens i won t be staying again even though the location was good
