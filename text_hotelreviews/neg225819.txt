i found it odd that i d booked a double room had updated my booking that there would be a second person in the room as you d expect this to be the norm for a double room a per day charge was put on for the extra person when checking out the value was quoted in stg i paid and the system defaulted to euro the hotel had its own rate exchange system which appears to be greater than the market rate there was no option to pay in stg only euro this is normally an option at the terminal or communicated via a staff member i see this as a way to get an extra out of me this was not obvious until the transaction had gone through this is an area that needs to be rectified and the extra person room charge does not appear clear and not described on booking com
