i got stuck in a lift as it did not move and doors did not open i and was almost fainting with fear i sounded the alarm many times but nothing happened i was in there for about minutes it was only when a guest called the lift from another floor that it moved i told staff and they tested the alarm and found it was not working a very bad experience and extremely frightening
