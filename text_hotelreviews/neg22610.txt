when i did my booking i have selected large double bed as i was travelling alone hotel gave me a room with single beds and i explained them that i chose large double bed they advised me that i made my reservation thru booking com and the bed selection is not a choice but a preference which they only check and give if there is availability the reservation is made thru their own system or booking com does not matter i made a choice and i was not informed that i was not going to have the double bed
