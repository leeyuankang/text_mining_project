at the entrance of the hotel there is a que for the night club and bar you also use the same lifts into hotel making you feel uncomfortable and intimidated the reception area for check in was so loud with the music coming from the bar it felt like we were in the nightclub itself when you get out of the lift to the welcome area there arent actually any staff there to greet you as a hotel guest in the evening we had nowhere to go for a quiet drink and relax it seemed the facilities are more for the clubbers than for the guests that are paying a premium it felt like a night club with bedrooms actually quite seedy and in public spaces made us feel uncomfortable not what you expect from a hotel more from a budget hotel at a weekend we are both seasoned travelers and have stayed in all standards of accomodation over the years but as a hotel we were very disappointed especially when you pay so much
