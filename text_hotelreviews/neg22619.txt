it took over an hour for the room to be ready i had early dinner reservations and was told i could use the gym facilities this is not a cheap hotel and for the money i am paying for the room it is unacceptable to get ready in the gym our room was next to an event being hosted at the hotel and so was rather noisy at times breakfast not included in original package only offered after i suggested some kind of gesture as the room was not ready
