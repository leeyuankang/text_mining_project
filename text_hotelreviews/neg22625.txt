the price we have eaten in hotels of high standard but pay one set price for either continental breakfast or cooked breakfast for only an omelette is far too expensive we were also charged for continental only had fruit juice cup of tea there was no semi skimmed milk they try to be different but miss the most obvious choices there were few cereals but no healthy raisins dates figs etc to put with the cereals you get it in other hotel restaurants not as expensive do not like service charge added to bill automatically especially when it s self serve buffet
