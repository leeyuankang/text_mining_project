very very noisy we were there for two nights the first night the room was so noisy on the floor because of the bar at the floor which we were told only stops the music at am we requested a change of the room and we re moved to the floor which was quieter however we got a wake up call by mistake at am the second night the fire alarm went off at am so we didn t get much sleep either night we were offered a discount on one night for compensation but at gbp per night s stay that was not much too noisy to be able to enjoy the facilities or the location so won t be staying there again
