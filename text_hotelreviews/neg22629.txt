i stayed on level and could hear the thumping base music from the nightclub for most of the evening until i eventually fell asleep it s on until on a friday saturday wish i d know before i went the room was very modern with a sink in the middle of the room so you can brush your teeth together the bathroom door offers little or no real privacy for ladies defo not for new couples sadly no bath crazy soft pillows small double bed maybe as king but not high end very cheap well used small towels sadly i really don t have much to say that s good so i won t say anything more staff where friendly overall super disappointing for a night room only maybe if you stay higher up and in a better room the experience would be improved shame was looking forward to trying this one out
