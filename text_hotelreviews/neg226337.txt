location inconvenient very far from the city of london the station next to the hotel royal park is not connected with the central line instead you need to go to hunger lane station which is a good minutes walking from the hotel don t believe that you can go to the city of london in minutes you need minutes walking to hunger lane and then another minutes on the central line
