the staff at the reception seemed not very familiar with their jobs there was often long queue at the reception although the team indeed delivered their service with friendly attitude they could not handle the regular check in check out proceeding in an efficient and organised way overall i felt that the hotel was understaffed and did not provide sufficient training to the employees therefore the service quality was seriously damaged
