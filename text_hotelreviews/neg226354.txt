only stayed as i could not cancel the booking as booking com changed the terms wont be coming back its not worth an advance payment nice but not a star to be charging in advance i know more up market hotels eg syon park who do not advance charge will be going there next time the receptionist promised me an upgrade for my inconvenience but it was just the floor above same rate room no perks here they just want your money
