what i did not like was the following bacon not cooked folded from the freezer and cooked in the oven so the bacon is not cooked in the middle the toaster not quick enough people queuing for toast ate in the restaurant on four occasions the service from the kitchen was terrible over ten minutes for bread and butter and minutes for a main course this is a new hotel but the kitchen staff need to turn the food around in a quicker period of time the price of wine and brandy is extortionate no house wine of a reasonable price bar seating is badly designed and failing
