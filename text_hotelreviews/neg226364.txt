the hotel seems ill equipped to cope when a big event is on at wembley although the staff were trying their best some fundamental design flaws ment that things did not go smoothly the check in desk is too small and badly situated so when you were queuing you were blocking the lifts there was not enough seating in the dining room for breakfast and we had to wait ages for a table and there is only one coffee machine to serve the entire dining room lunch in the restaurant was ok but service very slow even though not many other people were in there and there was a complete disaster when it came to ordering a cab to go to the concert which basically ended up with us being mins late i think this could be a good hotel with better thought and management but definitely not star service at the moment
