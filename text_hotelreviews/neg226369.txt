parking the parking is busy and there was construction site on the hotel this should be temporary but getting and out is not easy and parking is not included in the price per hours if you do not want to park in the hotel then you have to walk across a dual carriage way good luck with that there is only shower in the apartments there is bath tub despite the fact that i have been promised a bath tub and this was confirmed via booking com when i got to the room there was no bath tub and i have been by the reception and the manager that there are no bath tubs in none of the hotel rooms so if you want need a bath tub this is not your hotel in the room options on booking com it says bath tub or shower but be aware that there are no bath tubs the design is nice and fancy inside the hotel but then what s the point when you sit in the loo and there is a cm gap between the loo and wall the door stopped before completely closing guess what there was no main door separating the toilet from bathroom use your imagination what could this be like if there are two of you in the room also if you shut the toilet door the bathroom will have no door thanks to its strange design its a sliding door between the bathroom and the loo with no main door separating the toilet from living room and as you may guess the rooms are not that big at all i had a superior king room or one step from toilet and you were in the living room there was limited shampoo and soap in the bathroom if you need more then you had to call and kind and hard working i am assuming overloaded staff with their duties will bring you the extras in no time a waiting time of to minutes location wise it is not much great you have to drive about minutes including traffic in busy london to get to hotel from london city centre
