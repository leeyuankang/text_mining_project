shower leaked out of the cubicle onto the rest of the bathroom floor had to mop it all up with another towel the mood light turns other lights on aswel as the blue mirror light if there was a option to turn just the blue mirror light on that would be so much better the sky channels didn t work but they did offer to change our room but because we were only staying for the weekend we didn t change apart from that it was a wonderful stay
