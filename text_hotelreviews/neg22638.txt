as this was a surprise for my wife for our wedding anniversary i checked in myself while my wife was at the shops i asked if i could have a nice bottle of wine waiting on her arrival when she would be checking in which would be in a few hours still waiting for the wine and put a bit of a spoiler on things very disappointed perhaps it was because i was a bit of an ordinary joe and didn t arrive with an expensive suit or designer suitcases when i was leaving all the other guests were asked if they required a hand or a taxi i can only presume the didn t see me after all i am only and stone
