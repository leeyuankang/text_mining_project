the breakfast was quite expensive for the stuff they were offering and the trays were empty when we got to have breakfast the receptionist was really confused to find our name even when we showed our booking we stayed in a room for disabled people and was fantastic but i d say the toilet get wet too much so we wonder if a disabled person would be ok as they could easily slide into it
