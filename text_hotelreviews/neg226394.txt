the hotel was fabulous however the check in procedures need to be improved massively it took mins to check in the trainee staff member was not supported by the one remaining trained staff member who despite the trainee struggling left her to continue faffing with our check in despite having paid in advance for the room they tried to take a deposit for any potential room service for the separate rooms booked this process was also not completed correctly with a charge of being put onto my account i will check that this has been removed but didnt give me any confidence in the procedures the trainee was polite and helpful but she just needed careful mentoring through the process the whole hotel was beautiful but it all seemed under staffed and the staff require more customer care and procedure training
