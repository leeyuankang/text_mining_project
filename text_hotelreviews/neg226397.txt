parking was somewhat limited and you were unable to book a space which is slightly inconvenient however staff were very friendly and did everything they could to find you a parking space would be great if the hotel would let you book parking even if it was at a premium rate to provide piece of mind when travelling particularly late we arrived at midnight and would like to have known that we definitely had a car spot rather then just having to wait and see
