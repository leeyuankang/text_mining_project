ordered breakfast to room which never came they lost our order breakfast eventually came which was very unsatisfactory it was thrown on a plate our phone in the room didn t work either which we asked for it to be fixed but never done we asked reception to book a taxi for us but they forgot to other guests had the same issue with taxis more attention to detail really friendly service from the lady on the reception desk called tara parking should be free for hotel guests
