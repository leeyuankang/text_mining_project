the staff was very sarcastic the staff could improve in his attitude the only problem we had was quantity of sugar or milk but wasn t too much of an issue the shower room toilet was lovely but the only problem was the glass panel for the shower being too short of distance so the water escapes very easily and it is hard to maintain the cleanliness of the bathroom as well as enjoy the shower
