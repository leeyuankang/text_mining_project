we arrived at time that is possible to check in we got told to wait as cleaner is cleaning our room this is ridiculous as they have to clean what was worse is that more than groups and couples arrived in that time and got checked in immediately so we waited at reception and got told to sit and itd take max we ended up waiting one hour we were very disappointed as a hotel should be better organised in the morning i was just out of the shower and my partner was asleep and i hear our room door opening and its the cleaner they came in before check out time approx i was absoulutely outraged i was in my underwear getting changed when the staff completely intruded our privacy this is not a service and id advise anyone plannnig to stay here to not even bother the image of the place isnt even close to the representation of the service i told the reception about the cleaner coming in and she didnt even seem surprised she said im sorry about that and that theyll investigate ive had no contact from them and doubt i will horrible experience
