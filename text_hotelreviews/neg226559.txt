personally i don t really have any complaints anyone booking should be aware that the free parking is first come first served they look to have about maybe spaces on site i managed to park but i have no idea where else you would park round there if they were full up there were parking wardens everywhere around there its about minutes walk to brent cross tube station and around minutes to the nearest shops restaurants not an issue for me but it might be for some people
