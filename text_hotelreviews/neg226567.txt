there is a car park in theory but it is not reserved for residents and so had to use on street parking i am a single woman traveller and was shocked to be even offered a ground floor room that is not safe i had to insist on a different room it was a very hot night and the room faces onto a main road so not an option to leave windows open as its too noisy the air conditioning was inadequate and took along time to just get the edge off the intolerable stuffiness the mattress was cheap and lumpy pillows hard the tapsystem in the bathroom was so stiff i had to call for help to be able to run a cooling bath there was a large function on but i think that a competent hotel should be able to cope with extra travellers as well as a party
