position of the hotel very noisy indeed due to the main road little sleep obtained initially staff put us in a standard room instead of superior room this was rectified once we highlighted the problem food in the restaurant was appalling my daughter and i both left all of our main meals wet carpets in the bedroom not enough tea milk on the second day there were several areas of dried vomit just outside the hotel door this was offensive and should have been washed away
