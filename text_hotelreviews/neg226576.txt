private parking was advertised when i got there the gate was across the car park luckily i found a space on the road just got soaking wet in the process as it was torrential rain i arrived at due to traffic and thought i would be able to grab a quick something to eat the food stopped at half and was advised there was a room service menu in the room get to the room no menu had to call reception to see what i could have she didn t even know she had to walk over to the bar area and ask them i ended up with an expensive stale sandwich cut into little triangles the bread had been kept in the fridge and tasted awful there was no bottles of water in the room and she didn t ask if i wanted anything to drink couldn t be bothered calling again so used tap water i had originally paid for breakfast but just wanted to leave in the morning so didn t bother my room was next to big air vents on the roof this was very noisy and the air con was even louder the remote i had to press and times to change the channel there is a sky remote but it doesn t work i stay in the centre of london most of the time for the same price and a much nicer hotel but this time needed to be close to camden i would not stay here again
