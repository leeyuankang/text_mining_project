our three breakfasts could have been a lot better only tried them on the first day out of our three day stop as it wasn t good you would expect better for each the buffet breakfast was cold namely the scrambled eggs the bacon the mushrooms and the tomatoes the only thing hot were the sausages if you order toast you receive it about minutes after you order it by that time you have finished your breakfast the hour bar was cancelled due to a member of staff not turning up only operated on the friday night otherwise good
