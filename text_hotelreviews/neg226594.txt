the breakfast was optional at an additional per head the breakfast was extremely dissapointing with only member of staff topping up on food and beverage the bread rolls were rock hard and not edible i had to request on more than occasion for coffee to be topped up very limited vegetarian options for a hot breakfast i even heard other tables complaining about how dissapointing the breakfast was we ended up purchasing breakfast elsewhere after checkout parking is on a first come first serve basis but the hotel should inform people that street parking is for residents only between there were a fair few cars with parking tickets that may have been guests from the hotel the front of the hotel caters for up to cars if a huge van doesn t decide to take up more than allocated space the back car park can hold up to cars but is usually occupied by vans
