they do not look into request in booking tried to contact them via booking mail yet no answer but when we arrived we had no problem and they even gave us early accommodation what i have requested few weeks earlier but they didn t notice yet this was offered without me making a problem for ignoring my request they offered it without knowing i wanted it so this turns out to be positive at the end
