fire alarm was going off when we got there first room we went to smelt of smoke and the window didn t lose properly so we had all the noise from the road outside and a really annoying draft we spoke to reception who happily moved us rooms then the fire alarm went off again the first night we were there for almost mins this was at after this we had no lights in our room and had to wait until we had left the room the next day before they were sorted bed was hard and not very comfy a very forced apology was given by the reception but no offer of any compensation was ever made almost as if they really didn t care this was a few nights away for my birthday which was completely ruined by the experience at this hotel
