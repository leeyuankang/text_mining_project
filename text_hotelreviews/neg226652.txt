the landings smelt a little like nursing homes but once in the room it was spot on the lift felt a little juddery slow but i don t like lifts so am not the best person to pass judgement it s a pity you don t appear to be able to access the hotel from the rear car park which would make life a little easier not to mention safer for ladies who may be travelling alone because having to walk around from the side road to the front of the hotel whilst not far could be a little concerning late at night my main gripe has to be saved for the cost of the breakfast because for a buffet breakfast i can t help thinking this to be a little outrageous for that sort of money i expect a freshly cooked breakfast especially when you can literally go around the corner and find a cafe which charges less than for a cooked breakfast albeit not eat as much as you like but whilst i m no cheapskate when you have three breakfasts to pay for each soon adds up to be ridiculous even if breakfast is the most important meal of the day three breakfasts with a pint of fresh orange juice coffees for less than as opposed to paying is a no brainer i honestly believe if the hotel were to charge between and they d see more footfall through their restaurant for breakfast and surely when you re serving from a buffet the more you can get in the better
