breakfast is a little pricey for what you are getting i mostly chose continental and most days there were only apples available as fruit the two cold meat options were always dry which made me think they weren t fresh and the cheese were in awkward packages instead of slices wish there was a bigger selection for a cheaper price apart from this all was good
