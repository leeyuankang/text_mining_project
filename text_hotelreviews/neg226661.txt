the room was tiny could hardly get around without hitting something the gap between the bed and the tv which was against the wall was about one foot the bathroom was even worse the water takes ages to heat up so all through my stay i never washed my hands or brushed my teeth with warm water i had to leave the shower running for minutes before it turned warm i did not complain because i did not want to fuss food in the restaurant was cold when it arrived not star standards also the hotel is on the very busy
