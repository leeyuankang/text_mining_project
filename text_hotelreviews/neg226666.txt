wifi needed quite some personal info to register and log in so i skipped that sometimes waterpiping was a bit noisy but after one night you ll be used to that the location was a bit poor after having stayed in quite a few locations in london there always was a pub or underground nearby no pub here and the underground will take a ride in the bus or min walk when coming back at night e g from nye no buses or taxis anymore at golders green so walking is the only option
