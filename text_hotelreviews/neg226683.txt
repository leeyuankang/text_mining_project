the staff were dis organised on arrival they forgot to activate the door keys at breakfast was worse no cutlery no cups delayed tea ran out of tea spoons the room was noisy with cars passing by all night and a sound of flashing toilet was on part of the night my sleep was a nightmare i wish if staff would be trained to take care of guest from entry into the dining room to furnishing them with all their breakfast needs before they go to the next than the current situation where they are more than six but allover following each other with tasks half done
