the one issue that spoiled our stay was the excessive road traffic noise on hendon way my wife was unable to sleep at all on saturday night and unfortunately our room was located at the front of the hotel directly overlooking the busy road i don t think the skylight window had double glazed sound proofing and as we were only staying for one night we decided not to request a room change i also requested a quiet room away from traffic noise when i made the initial on line booking but that seems to have been overlooked
