the corridors leading to our room smelt dusty and our room smelt like no one had stayed there for ages was not impressed with the cleaning and i do not believe our towels were changed daily as i put a mark on one and had the same one the next day breakfast was hit and miss it is a buffet and basically it was luck if you got hot food or not on tuesday our breakfast was lovely on wednesday our breakfast was very cold and horrible and no one cared i reluctantly paid for it as our breakfast was not included in our stay we did not have an evening meal or use any of the facilities so can not comment on that the nearest tube station was about minute walk away at a general pace luckily we were out of the hotel most of the time we were in london and only there to sleep i wouldn t stay here again
