as a longtime booking com customer i have noticed that places are not always as good as the reviews lead one to believe however this place was so bad in every possible way i suspect the positive reviews cannot be true this motel is located in the middle of a sketchy neighborhood with nothing nearby i did not feel safe with my family everything is minutes away walking metro coffee a bite to eat everything the hotel is dark old and had an odor i could write in the dust on the top of the shelves one of our rooms smelled like sewage we complained to the front desk but the smell remained we overlooked the hotel back alley that was cluttered with junk and the staff was kind enough to wake us up talking loudly during their am smoke break the beds looked normal until you sat on them several inches of mattress would suddenly disappear under the lightest compression i had back problems for weeks after the visit and had to visit a physician unfortunately in the rush to leave with three small children we left our amazon kindle in the room we noticed it missing as soon as we got to the airport called the hotel and explained the exact location where it would have fallen between the bed and wall and followed up with several detailed emails of course the device was never found in the room this horrible experience does not even consider the fact that when my mother was in an accident and couldn t fly we had to fight to get the dates changed until after her recovery i understand no refunds but this should have been an easy exception and they kept the money for the additional day we did not use when we re booked it was just a horrible place all around not only will i avoid the brand at all costs in the future but i now feel that i can no longer trust booking com and i will not be using them in the future
