room service was demanding me pounds extra for just dropping a water bottle in my room in night i was surprised if i myself take water bottle from reception would be pounds and if they deliver it to my room it will be extra pounds per tray bathroom as it was leaking as when i took shower a lany from reception came to tell me if i am using washroom correctly as they are having water drops down i was surprised should be more welcoming with free water bottles in room for at least checkin time but it was not there and was charged separately
