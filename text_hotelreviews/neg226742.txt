the shower was very weak i stayed in the same room before and it was more powerful back then towels had a slight hint of vinegar in scent air con was not able to be turned on even though not turned on the air con started to make loud undefined noise for aprox hours which was a little annoying as we could not turn it off since i am from the city the traffic noise did not disturb me that much unless i watched tv it was a bit hard to find a decent volume on the tv with all the traffic noise in the background
