unfortunatly other guests spoiled our stay our room was directly above the function room the room had a set of french doors which opend to a small balcony over looking the rear private carpark it was a very humid night so we left the doors open unfortunatly members of the party which was taking place in the function room gatherd in the rear car park at about they acted like children and decided to start throwing bits of left over food through the doors and into our room on check in we was notified by staff of the party and that our room was directly above but me being a heavy sleeper i was not fussed and said it would be fine i think if we would of asked the staff we would of being offerd an alternate room apart from this incident it would of probably being a pleasent stay
