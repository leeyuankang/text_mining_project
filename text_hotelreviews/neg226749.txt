i have been staying in many bw hotels and this is probably the worst i was the last one to check in and i got the last room available which is facing the road hendon way the room is not very well insulated so you hear cars passing by every seconds super noisy staff aneil tried to help us moving to a different room but at the end he could not do anything electrical issue apparently i have been waiting almost for an hour from to despite aneil s kindness no solution has been provided also no hear plugs were available in the morning alberto duty manager apologised again and he offered me breakfast which i did not want or discount of which i think it is not enough if you are staying in for with no sleep if you really want to stay at this bw please avoid rooms facing the road
