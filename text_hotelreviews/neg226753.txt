on this trip to london we stayed in bw twice a couple of days each time on the first occasion we encountered a couple of problems including a smelly chimney from the kitchen which meant not being able to open our window mentioned this at the front desk and as compensation were told next time we booked we d get a reduction on our return we were given a lovely room but on the second morning the shower stopped mid shower relocated to another room but horror of horrors we were directly in line of that awful chimney from the kitchen again and this time the air con was simply a joke and couldn t provide adequate ventilation to counter this
