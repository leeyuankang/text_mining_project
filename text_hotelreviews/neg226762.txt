i would not recommend to stay in this hotel or have dinner in the restaurant inside the hotel about the restaurant all meals are over priced the food quality is less than average we arrived to the restaurant at around pm the restaurant closes at pm and the last order was at pm according to the front staff staff quality at the restaurant was really poor they forgot to ask how to cook steaks didn t ask any sauce to bring the worst experience at restaurant i ve ever gone the sausage was not cooked properly half rare the spring rolls were very tiny too oily and over priced the reception staff did not speak good english or she had basically difficulty to understand what customer wants i simply asked her i need to have early breakfast earlier than their breakfast serving time but didn t give me clear answer and i need to wait to talk to the male leader or a male manager to arrive the manager was not very polite anyway car park was too small so we needed to park on the road where very dark and i did not feel safe to park my car there i will never go to the restaurant again
