we booked a double room and got given single beds pushed together view out of the window was peoples back gardens and most nights they were having parties and were loud so it was hard to sleep the room was tiny and looked nothing like it did on the internet no where near as modern we stayed for days nights and the whole time we never had hot water in the shower except for on the last day got told a lot of misleading information and it wasn t in a very nice area definitely not worth the money
