on first arrival our room smelt like people had been smoking there was also a big generator outside our room which woke us multiple times in the morning the view from my window was somebodies house and back garden our second night myself and my partner checked out of the hotel due to a big party happening at the hotel and all you could hear was the music which was shaking our room and lots of people shouting i spoke to reception and asked what time the party ended to which they replied about midnight i said ok could you have not informed us of this prior to which he shrugged his shoulders and said your room is right above it he then said you look very tired aswell which i replied i am tired and also not feeling well after then arranging to stay at a family members we went to check out recepetion then said they could offer us another room which was one floor up however the hotel is small and the noise could still be heard they offered no compensation and i still had to pay for second nighy despite leaving at i m not usually somebody to complain but this hotel is dreadful i wouldn t recommend to my worst enemy
