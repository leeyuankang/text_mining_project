breakfast was horrible the first day there the eggs were cold the hot chocolate was cold and certainly not up to best western standards the second morning the eggs smelled burnt and had a foul odor once again hot chocolate was cold the last morning the eggs were hot but runny at last the hot chocolate was hot i suggest you get a new chef because certainly this one falls below the mark i have stayed in many hotels and never seen a breakfast so horribly i am not one to make a fuss so did not say anything while there but you certainly lost a customer i feel that what i was charged for these meals were atrocious compared to the quality of food
