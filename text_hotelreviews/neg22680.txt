the staff are fairly up themselves i didn t feel particularly welcome my room was substandard yes it looks very trendy and i can t fault that you do get an iron decent hair dryer iphone dock as standard however the sink in the middle of the room is a novelty to be cool but is fairly annoying and inconvenient the showerhead sprayed in all directions clearly needing a decent de scaling the automatic light also didn t go out in the shower room neither did the fan it wasn t the best night sleep i ve had in a hotel the location is noisy particularly on a saturday night you are right next to china town and leicester square expect lots of noise from outside unfortunately it extends inside too as the bar is popular with the early s crowd dressed up to the hills all thinking they are being exclusive and classy by paying over the odds for cocktails so it s busy and noisy in the communal areas be warned if you want a late drink at the hotel bar you will be battling with the public to get served and the bar staff are quite slow being all male behind the bar on the night i was there meant all the pretty young girls were getting served first and i stood there growing ever more annoyed at being ignored i did asked to switch rooms for my second night which was met with a look of inconvenience almost as though they hadn t ever been asked this before they didn t particularly apologise for the genuine problems with my room it was a sunday night and i know they had lots of empty rooms it was hardly a big request any tourists staying here please take note not to use their car service it is outrageous what they charge i did a min journey due to bad weather and was charged being from south london i know that should have cost around max you will be much better off walking secs to the main road and getting a black cab or downloading uber don t let them rip you off
