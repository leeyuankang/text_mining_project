the hotel looked very old and dull carpet not clean the bed was very uncomfortable i had back pain the next morning although free wifi was advertised there was no connection mostly the entire time i was there and when i called the receptionist she said they are fixing it but it was never fixed the remote was not working too so i had to change channels manually most of the time
