the only thing that could be improved is the hallways could be revamped but other than that i can not complain cannot comment on the noise as was at the back of the hotel and it was silent back there but considering it is on a dual carriageway there is bound to be noise so if you want somewhere quiet then don t book the hotel and expect no noise
