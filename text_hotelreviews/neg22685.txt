seemed to cater more for non residents than for residents maybe because it was a saturday night but late afternoon all the seating and tables in the bar areas were reserved or taken by non residents and the evening wasn t even worth trying as lots of non residents were piling in to use the bar and club we felt like outsiders so went straight to bed all the staff looked like bouncers restaurant was closed which we hadn t been aware of until we arrived hallways so dimly lit it gave a bit of a seedy feel no coffee or tea in the room had to ask and only got capsules so who gets the coffee shame as we were really looking forward to it
