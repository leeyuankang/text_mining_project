oh where to start mattress was this incredibly soft foam that you sunk into and it was really quite uncomfortable after a while corridors were quite dangerous i felt they had random stairs in the corridors with lights that turned on to motion sensors but by the time you get to the stair the light still wasn t on i stumbled a few times view from the bedroom the side of a building pretty poor heating in the rooms i ve stayed in many many hotel rooms over the years and never had to faff about with the heating in the room it was absolutely roasting in the room at night and i tried taking the temperature down didn t work about an hour later woke up again and opened a window still nothing at about woke up again played with the ac unit and couldn t get it to stay on to blow cold air so i phoned reception who were able to sort it from their main control panel horrible night s sleep nothing in the local area hotel s situated in a residential area and that s really nothing else around tube station proximity poor nearest tube station is a mile away
