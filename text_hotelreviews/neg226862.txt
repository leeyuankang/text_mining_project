staff are very rude and slow customer service is inexistent waiting time at check in was hour waiting time for fixing the safe cash box was minutes while the guests came to pick us up and waited in front of hotel in a car got locket out of the room twice because they annulled our room cards because we didn t pay for one bottle of water at the bar we told them to put the water in the room charge etc etc bad experiences never finished and every day was a challenge in dealing with the staff and management of this hotel who have zero clue about customer service location is also a disaster avoid this hotel if you can because there are plenty of other better hotels in london for sure at affordable prices
