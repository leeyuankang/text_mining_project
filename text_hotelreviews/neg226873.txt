the hotel is on a really busy road very noisy traffic upon arrival the window in our room wouldn t close so the room was absolutely freezing we asked a member of staff to take a look and they were with us within about minutes to resolve the issue the staff couldn t have been more helpful my biggest complaint would be the rock hard pillows and ridiculously small bathroom the toilet was squashed between a wall and shower not the nicest of spaces to be in like i say the staff we had the pleasure of dealing with were brilliant although i feel the hotel could do with an update
