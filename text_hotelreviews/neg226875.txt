it was difficult to get into the car park i told staff at reception when i was headed there and how long it would take me to arrive but they did not monitor my transit and i stood outside the car park for several minutes fruitlessly trying the intercom which apparently did not work i had to leave my car in front of the gate and walk back to reception to ask them to open the gate the bed was lumpy and not up to normal acceptable standard the tv sound was off the was no indication on the phone how to call reception when i wanted to get someone to fix the tv i had to hunt around for the number the shower control was hard to decipher it was engraved in monochrome metal partly occluded from sight and was very easy to miss the check in staff did not note i had paid for breakfast and i was challenged by the breakfast room staff who asked if i wanted to pay i already had the car parking and breakfast altercations were therefore quite embarrassing even humiliating moments not a good indication of customer care
