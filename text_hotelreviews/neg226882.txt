people being allowed to smoke at the only entrance available so we had to inhale all the smoke as we entered or left the hotel also we had difficulty getting into the hotel one night due to having a big van just on the entrance this was left all night and was a fire and safety hazard should a person on a wheel chair required access it would have been impossible or a child s baggy for that matter
