location is easy enough to get to by car but is not ideal to get into central london as the nearest tube station is a minute walk i had also enquired about an upgrade or a complimentary drink from the hotel as i was celebrating years with my girlfriend i did not receive any feedback from the hotel which was unfortunate i understand it is not required nor expected but i felt it would have been good to at least hear back which would improve their customer service
