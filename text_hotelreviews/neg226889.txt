booking com said this hotel was near finchley central which is not true and meant that we had to get a taxi to and from the tube stop the nearest tube to this hotel is about a min walk our door key didn t work when we arrived nor did replacements the staff suggested that we just ask someone from reception to come up with us and let us in every time we wanted to get in i asked for a different room however and we were eventually relocated to a different floor however in the second room a lamp the shower door and the extractor fan was broken
