location is ok but not great it s about a min walk to golders green tube station or a short taxi ride also there was large fan on a ventilation duct just outside our room which made some noise on and off so we could not leave the windows open for long these were the only downsides but you can t have everything especially as this hotel offers such good value for money overall i was very pleased with the hotel
