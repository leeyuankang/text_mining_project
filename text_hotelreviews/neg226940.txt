we were staying above the function room and there was a wedding taking place no one informed us of this when we checked in the base on the music was too loud and prevented us hearing each other or the tv the music went off at however the incessant noise from spoilt the second night and due to being on a corridor with the wedding party meant the return to rooms was noisy and we were disturbed until am if we had been informed that the function was on we would have made other arrangements for the night as it spoilt the next day too due to lack of sleep we did not feel aggrieved at the wedding party in anyway we just wished the hotel had told us so we could make other arrangements
