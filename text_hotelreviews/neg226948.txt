we had a generator outside our room which started around on the first day and then when we took the first shower the shower tray flooded and we had to move room nobody should have been put in this room due to the generator being right outside the window but they obviously chance their luck here as there is no way this has not been complained about before the property is also a min walk from the nearest tube station and there are no bars or restaurants around i am not sure what constitutes a star but i would not say this hotel is any better than any star i have stayed in
