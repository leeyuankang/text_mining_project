we had been told that a parking space had been reserved for me close to the front door as i am disabled however on arrival there were no parking spaces and the car park was full so had to park in a side street and walk late at night to the hotel with our luggage and a small child and was advised i could go and move my car later in the night after a function had finished and they had left however that would have meant moving my car in the early hours expensive to eat at the hotel restaurant bar
