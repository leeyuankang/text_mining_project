i tought i had purchased one night in a hotel room but it was actually one night in a club this hotel is a big mess in the weekend with people partying and walking around the hotel from the bars to their rooms with their drinks in their hands extremely noisy at this price there are other hotels in london with similar services where you can actually sleep peacefully or other clubs with entrance fees cheaper than one night at the w
