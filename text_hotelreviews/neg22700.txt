the rooms were not what we expected too small and a cramped layout the sink at the room walkway made it difficult to have more than one person doing anything in the room the toilet immediately behind it made moving around awkward the usb plug by the bed did not work the light in the facial mirror did not work and we were told they were put in but not hooked up yet and the tv only provided a few stations the front desk welcome area did not feel very inviting more like an afterthought and our room upgrade did nothing but move us up one floor level same floor plan same room it was not worth the extra money to move up one floor
