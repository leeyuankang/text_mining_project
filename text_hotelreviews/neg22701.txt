the furniture has worn off especially in the lounge if you come during the day you will also spot stains on leather sofas room was ok nothing special or luxurious wc and shower are separated very weird really hard to open the doors the light turns on with sensor so during the night sometimes the light turns on without us moving at all we could also hear the pipes they were very loud so it bothered us while we tried to get a good sleep overall i have stayed in w hotels all over the world but this one has nothing to do with rest i have stayed in better stars hotels than this not coming back for sure
