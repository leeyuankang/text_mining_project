the only thing i have to mention is air conditioning it was a cold in the hotel room but got colder the later it got this could be controlled from inside but didn t seem to make any affect i called down to front desk and this was adjusted externally by the hotel but it took a good mins to get it optimal temperature i was asleep and by the time i woke up it was very hot i do think hotels located in the uk shouldn t bother with air conditioning it s cold enough
