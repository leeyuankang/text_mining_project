there are only two things that were to my displeasure and it honestly was not the hotel s fault first upon arrival i had taken a shower and the drain was plugged from other travelers hair which caused it to flood the floor this was quickly alleviated by staff the second would be the construction in front of the hotel which will be over very shortly i had drove in and couldn t use the proper route however it makes it a bit easier to cross the street when walking a silver lining so to speak
