i had a bad experience with this hotel during check in the woman in front desk told me that they have problem in water heating system and they cannot accommodate me in this hotel due to this reason and they booked other hotel for me i felt uncomfortable by this offer since the second hotel was far away around miles and the hotel was full of guests and no one of them was talking about heating system so i decided to to turn the table against them so i request from woman in front desk to show me the room for testing the water heating system by my self suddenly her supervisor came i forget to take her name and it became clear that they have overbooking in this hotel it clearly proven they try to handel this problem by laying to the guests during that an european guest came for check in and the process for check in goes smothly i start shotting to the hotel staff by saying this hotel treat guests beased on nationality what a shame so the decided to give my room which was non refundable but they give me a very bad room with bad location later they change the room i will never book again in this hotel
