the place is great with the one serious exception that there is no sink in the bathroom but in the middle of the room that is very inconvenient it is very difficult to groom yourself without making a mess on the center counter or on the floor also many personal hygiene are preferred to be done in the bathroom especially if you have company in the room another couple minor negative things are that the hall ways smell bad from time to time and the bouncers can be a bit intimidating
