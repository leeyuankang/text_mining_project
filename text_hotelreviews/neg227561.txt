the cost the hotel is good i ve been to paris twice stayed in a different hotel last time which wasn t as expensive and then this time payed much much more but didn t see the difference in paying the much more felt like the cheaper hotel i stayed in was just as good the extra money wasn t justified but it s a nice hotel
