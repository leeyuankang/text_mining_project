we re so disappointed with the hotel it doesn t come cheap and i felt like being ripped off nearly for an old dusty and lack of amenities in the room we stayed in the duplex one on the top floor and our king size bed was made of two single beds and you can easily tell when you lie down doesnt have dental kit in the bathroom low quality bathrobes and towels no restaurant serving breakfast only in room dining the only thing great about the hotel is their location other than that definitely consider other options in paris you can get a lot better deals than this
