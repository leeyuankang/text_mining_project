the smallness of the room and bathroom even in a junior suite the payment policy of the hotel horrible the lack of a good restaurant attached to the hotel currently hankies the adjacent restaurant is what the hotel uses this is not a restaurant that serves really good breakfasts or even good afternoon teas etc you have to go to the nearest pret a manger to get espresso yogurt fresh fruit etc and forget about really good lunches part of the problem is the rating that booking com gives the hotel the rooms are unbearably small
