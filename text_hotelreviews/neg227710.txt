the air circulation within the room was very poor and even with the air conditioning at the lowest setting it was still rather warm the cleaniless of the room was below a five star standard that i would expect there was a collection of dust above the mirror along the wall which was clearly visible when entering the bathroom the corner of the shower were also covered in some sort of lime scale and dark residue
