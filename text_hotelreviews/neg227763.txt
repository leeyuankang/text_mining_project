the hotel does not have a restaurant which given its location is no big deal however the bar next door is in our opinion extremely poor and is not a reflection of the high standard of the rest of the hotel it is not clear if the bar coffee shop is part of the hotel but it is expensive and poor an area for attention another point is that the bar coffee shop not being part of the hotel closes at and therefore there are no facilities for guests to relax on returning to the hotel
