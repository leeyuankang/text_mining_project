i booked this hotel form my parents the room was clearly booked under a different name to mine yet when they got there at check in they were told they had to pay as it had to be paid by someone staying at the hotel and the money was refunded back to me seems absolutely ridiculous to me so much for the gift defiantly reuined the relaxed night away experience i had hoped for them
