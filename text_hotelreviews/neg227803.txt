the room was tiny we had paid for a premier double with a view the view was difficult to see because of an inch window sill and we basically faced another hotel with shaftesbury ave below us the room was tiny it was a double bed but was pushed up against the wall so for two adults to sleep comfortable it was a struggle it was the worst night sleep i have had in a hotel in london the bathroom was also very small and anyone carrying a few excess pounds would have found it snug the hotel itself was clean and the facilities in the room were great just wasn t value for money
