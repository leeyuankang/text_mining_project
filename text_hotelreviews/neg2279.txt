room was far too small window was so cold and drafty that we were all awake most of the night i ve never complained about a hotel before but it was awful the only place the cot would fit was in the window and the baby was genuinely freezing cold we had another young child so couldn t move rooms in the middle of the night consequently we all had no sleep it really wasn t acceptable the room was too small really drafty and the curtains didn t actually meet so the youngest child was up at the crack of dawn too really marred our holiday hotel offered back on the room but this really wasn t enough based on such a terrible night such a shame because this place could be really great
