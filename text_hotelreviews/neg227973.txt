it s a little noisy in the front rooms a night we had disability room which was a perfect size for someone in a wheelchair and had a huge shower however if you book a hotel on shaftsbury avenue it s not unexpected my husband doesn t sleep much so he actually enjoyed sitting in the window watching all the super cars
