having pre booked and paid for this hotel in advance for one of our directors i was shocked to receive a call from said director advising they were refusing him entry to his room apparently you needed photographic id and a form filled out by the card holder for a payment already made what is the point in pre paying for this to be the situation on arrival he had to stand in reception for over half an hour waiting for someone in our head office to scan paperwork over as they were in a meeting this resulted in him being late for his event in the evening the reception team were unwilling to cancel the booking and let him pay with his own credit card really unhelpful
