when we arrived we were told they had no room available for us then after seeing i was unhappy magically found one we found the room clean but tiny not like the pictures when we arrived back after our evening out there was a nasty noise coming though the wall which kept us awake all night and i mean a nasty noise in the morning i told the staff of our issues and the girl was quite help fully but had nothing she could do for us as the manger was off i did get a discount which i found odd as the room was totally unsatisfactory in every way but couldn t seem to make my point in all my weekend was totally spoiled by a nasty experience in the hotel very poor
