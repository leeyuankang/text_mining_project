on the date of our departure we accidentally left some money in the room when we returned to get it the room had been cleaned the money had gone and everyone played dumb all the staff were foreign and spoke good english in general yet when this came up their english suddenly became broken and trying to get any information from them was almost impossible leaving us angry and frustrated whilst at the desk another gentleman was arguing with another member of the staff over something and also left very frustrated at the lack of understanding i employ foreign staff myself but ensure they either speak excellent english or can be backed up in a situation by someone who can communicate perfectly a very disappointing end to an otherwise good stay we wouldn t use this place again for that reason only
