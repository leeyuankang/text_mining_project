i was charged twice for my room only to be told my card had been declined which didn t make sense and my partner had to pay for the room on her credit card which was embarrassing for me i am currently waiting for the hotel to credit the money they took from my account in the first place would have got a fantastic review otherwise but i will now wait and see how long my refund will take a hotel of this magnitude should be offering me a free stay for the massive inconvenience it has caused myself and my partner and i m still waiting for an apology
