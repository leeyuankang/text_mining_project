one of our group is allergic to feathers all duvets were feathers although a similar situation had happened the week before no polyester duvets were available nor any blankets she therefore was offered extra sheets in december luckily it wasn t cold they did offer to up our heating but not quite the same as snuggling in a duvet or blanket i will write directly to the head office to make them aware
