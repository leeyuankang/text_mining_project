the gentleman who checked us in was initially friendly but didn t seem happy when we requested a room on a different higher floor after initially stating that they were full and unable to accommodate us we were eventually moved to a more suitable room after pressing the point our room was very small especially for a deluxe the floor was dusty didn t seem cleaned there was a half eaten packet of biscuits in the bedside table drawer the bathroom was very small and the bath didn t have a shower curtain so everything ended up soaking wet after a shower
