the fire alarm went off on our first night in the early of the morning it rang and rang but there was no information from any hotel staff about its cause or if it was a false alarm eventually the alarm stopped and we guests returned to our beds without any instruction to do so by any night staff there was no such person in evidence good the bedroom floor was very dusty and had not been properly vacuumed
