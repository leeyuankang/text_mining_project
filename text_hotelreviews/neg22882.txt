saturday may was a hot day and evening it was great to have a fan in our room but the noise was keeping me awake so i switched it off at in the morning the accommodation below us must have had the same fan on because i could theirs going round all night but it wasn t quite as loud as if you had the fan in your own room i can sleep through anything usually the noise was obviously the whirring sound of the fan going around it was also a hot night and i was nervous about walking the challenge the next day which i and my friend completed in mins this is not a complaint just an observation as the room was lovely and the beds were very comfortable
