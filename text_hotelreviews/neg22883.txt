bedrooms were stifling hot advised staff we were there in hot weather the heating was turned off but the pipes leading to them were boiling hot so the rooms were still heated as a result uht milk cartons had gone off and the provided bottled water was undrinkable no fridge facility in rooms or even a fan were clearly short staffed and at busy periods they were under pressure and seemed to be working around the clock supposedly a continental breakfast i do not consider limited cereal and a loaf supplemented by some cheese and meat to meet that definition croissants etc were available for other customers but not for staying guests you have to ask for fruit juice only water is automatically provided very little fruit provided just a small bowl of some fruit cocktail typical london food and drink prices speaking as someone living in yorkshire shower not properly cleaned bedrooms are not large and have limited storage so could be an issue for longer stays
