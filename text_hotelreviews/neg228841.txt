nowhere on the booking com information on this hotel is it noted that the junior suite is three flights up a steep staircase with no elevator the hotel claims to have air conditioning but it was on only on the ground floor the staff kept saying it was broken and would be fixed but than changed their statement to say it wasn t on yet but it was on just not in the rooms we had to keep the windows open for air no fans and could see directly into the bedrooms and baths across the way and those guests could see into our room it was a most unpleasant stay it was our fifth time and our last breakfast service was incredibly slow only one waiter for a full house so we had to sit at tables with used cloths and limited dishes and wait a very long time for coffee the cooked food was inedible the croissants were good bread not
