my work laptop couldn t connect to the wifi because it had a pop up blocker installed which meant that i could not access my emails none of the staff knew how to help me with this and they were unable to connect me with someone who could help it made working in hotel impossible which was quite problematic given that this was a business trip in addition our first room has a ventilation problem in the bathroom which caused smells from other bathrooms in the building to waft into our bedroom when we raised the issue the staff kindly upgraded us to another room where the bathroom was very nice and had no smell finally the shower door was not properly sealed and water seeped out during a shower causing a pool of water to form on the tile floor and soaking the bath mat aside from those three issues which were relatively minor the room and the hotel was very nice
