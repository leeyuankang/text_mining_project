i have booked and paid for superior room but instead was given chamber room small room when i asked that my room supposed to be larger in size they informed that no rooms available basically take it or leave it next day they refunded part payment management is nice but night staff not really if you book in this hotel make sure that you call them and confirm that you are getting the room otherwise you may not receive the room you paid for otherwise the hotel is very nice
