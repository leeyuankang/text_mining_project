i wish they would have told me i could get reimbursed for the vat i paid not only at thevictoria but everywhere i shopped or dined didn t realize this was possible until i got to the airport for my return flight and was asked if i had the necessary forms from the merchants to get reimbursed for the tax i paid this would have been over pounds just from the victoria
