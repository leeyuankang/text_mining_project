we had to move rooms in the middle of the night on our first night because the shower was not draining and was flooding our room originally they tried to get us to stay in our own room and use staff facilities to shower which was obviously unacceptable in our second room there was no hot water so we all had cold showers the staff did not offer apologies or an alternative for this it is a bit of a rough area with ladies of the night outside the front door at night the wall outlets are old fashioned so we could not use our international adapters to charge our phones or use any electronics they did not provide shampoo or conditioner in the bathrooms and we had to call down for clean towels that they were reluctant to provide
