location is great but located in an area where at night it gets a bit interesting if you have kids with you and you are coming back to the hotel after dark you may have to answer a question or two about who those ladies are on the street and why they are so friendly to dad as you walk by don t get me wrong we never felt unsafe though any time day or night in the hotel or around the area of the hotel and actually it made for a good laugh or two folks it s paris at night you know that going in so deal with it my only suggestion for the hotel itself is to add an ice machine and ice buckets to the hotel or put small fridge in each room from that one sentence you know i m american i can t help it i like an ice machine bottom line is it is a great place to stay for the price and yes we would stay there again
