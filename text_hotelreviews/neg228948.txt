the door to our hotel room had been kicked in at some time not a very welcoming sight the area not a place i would choose to stay in again the room size was ok but not what we expected for a best western shabby in need a decor upgrade two sachets of tea and milk not replenished on our second day shower mat taken away and not replace front door should have been locked after this was not the case street was noisey but we had ear plugs so that didn t matter to much all in all not to impressed shame i cancelled the other hotel and not this one sadly didn t take photos
