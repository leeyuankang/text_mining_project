i booked what they described as a family room picture showed what was described but when we got there holy crap far from what was shown this room looked like a storage room or some kind of utility room made up to look like a family room it was hideous there was a glass door with crash bar handle that led out to a stairwell at the back of the property did not feel safe when i checked in there were light fixtures missing so the bulbs were exposed wallpaper peeling off the wall and the carpet was stained the air conditioning was not blowing well even though they swear it was a maximum shape i sent an email to the manager after the first night and she did respond back and talked to me at the property but did not off any discount or anything to compensate for the shoddy room the desk clerk i first made my complaint to was rude and very unconcerned about my issues the location is very busy and suspicious people hang out there i don t understand how this hotel can be rated stars and have short comings like this the hotel blamed booking for the pictures i informed them that the pictures were from the property not people who upload i paid way too much for this nasty room and would ask that booking ensure the hotels are representing the properties accurately it doesn t make sense for people to travel far to enjoy themselves and be subjected to an uncomfortable room i want a refund
