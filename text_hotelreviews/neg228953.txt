this hotel is in a dangerous area our room was left open by cleaner luckily never had all our stuff stolen the community needle bus pulled up outside and all the local prostitutes got on to get their condoms needles and blood pressure check there was a lot of dodgy activity and noise all night and we were nearly mugged avoid this property at all costs it s just not worth the risk
