after pulling back my bed covers to get in bed i found dirty male and female underwear under the bed cover there was no toilet roll or shower gel in the bathroom when i complained i was put in a much smaller room until my previous room was cleaned this was then given to another guest as i was forgotten about i feel as though my complaint was just swept under the carpet and no one really cared i will never stay at this hotel again and before anyone books to stay at the best western i d advice you to look at the surrounding area bookings com shows you pictures of surrounding areas near to the eiffel tower which is completely different from where the hotel is actually situated
