the room was tiny not too bad considering that we were always out and about but there was no space for a fridge or even a bin nice view from the top floor tho we could get a glimpse of the sacre cour the bed didn t work for me and my partner it was a painful nights of sleep the mattress was hard which i normally prefer but you could feel the springs which made it somehow uneven also the pillows were not great the wifi was painfully slow
