nice restaurant good food not good for stay on business vould not stay again or recommend very hot on the room open the window and from till you will get big long distance planes landing every minutes when west wind single glazed windows wouldn t sound proof enough anyway included breakfast is only continental good breakfast is when you pay extra on this occasion service in the morning was very very bad corder tea you get coffee ask for missing glass for the water and you wouldn t get it and the best at the end came to breakfast and there was no bread and had to wait minutes for the chef to arrive
