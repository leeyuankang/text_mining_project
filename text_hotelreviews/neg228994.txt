this hotel is not in a good area we were traveling with three children we thought it would be nice to be close to montmartre and a short distance from gare du nord we did not feel safe walking around with children we ended up spending more money on uber because of this we recommend staying on the other side of sacr c ur the hotel wasn t great quality either the toilet leaked and flooded our room while all the rooms say non smoking our rooms had a strong smoke smell
