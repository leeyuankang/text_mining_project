evening meal charging for a main and then charging between each for extras such as a salad seasonal greens or new potatoes not advertising there was a service charge and adding an extra to my bill the breakfasts were poor and inconsistent no jugs of fruit juice no pots of tea or coffee only the latter was offered and served in mugs breakfast day one and the buffet table had only slices of cheese there were two large uncut loaves and a few croissants slices of untrimmed pineapple and melon and some half filled jars of cereal yoghurt and compote the latter was the best bit day two there were no croissants i asked the woman serving but she said they were ready yet this was at about and none ever came as vegetarians we had the last couple of slices of cheese off the buffet these didn t get replenished even though more guests arrived there were however sliced meats on offer that morning at this second breakfast we we were offered a glass of fruit juice i m not fussy but this was horrible the fresh fruit selection was worse than the previous day with slices of untrimmed pineapple and a fruit bowl of apples and oranges breakfast at the victoria is very much a token gesture at keeping the cost down and it showed i ve stayed in some far cheaper places than this and had much better continental breakfasts i m pretty fit but the walk through the maze of streets to richmond tube station is too far
