first of all bed sheets were not changed a single time in days secondly the coffee mugs that were located in the room itself were also not changed or cleaned since the day to be honest it was my first time when i have had such a low quality customer service in the best western hotel lastly the concierge guy tried to rip us off by forcing to drive with a taxi company suggested by him he wen t even for an extra mile saying that all other taxis will charge us much more than the one offered by him to be more specific he wanted us to pay euros for a cab to the orly airport where as i showed him that uber would charge only euros and a local taxi asked us for euros only long story short he convinced us that the other taxis will force us to pay more than the taxi company of his choice so we were forced to pay euros for a taxi that actually cost euros i felt very disappointed in the bratnd value of best western hotels now i will always take my time to consider other hotel chains before applying for a best western hotel p s in one of the days they even forgot to replace the toilet paper we actually had to call them and remind them to bring one roll if that is how best western imagines to treat their customers then i would recommend to downgrade them to a star hotel
