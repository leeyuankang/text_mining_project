the room was served every day but for night stay we never have linen change the room was never dusted and houvered and also the rubbish in the bedroom was still there when we return in the evening the area is horrible full with prostituts and drug dealers you can t go out after pm and specialty if you are women i can t even explain how scary it is that s the only thin that will stop me to go back in this hotel the next thing i don t like is that you can t go for drink or diner in the hotel and you have to go out and search for restaurants outside
