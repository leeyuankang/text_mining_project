severe problems with bed bugs in my room it had nothing to do with cleanliness as the hotel is very clean i had welts on my face neck hands and back i have never experience such a problem my travel plans called for me to travel to other parts of france and then back to paris i canceled my return stay because of the problem i am assuming this is an issue of a previous traveler depositing the nasty critters but there should be a routine check after every stay it is a shame since this is a fine hotel
