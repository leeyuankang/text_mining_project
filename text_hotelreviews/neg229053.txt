i didn t like the hotel policy of changing towels every two days and not changing the bed sheets even once in days there was no fridge in the room the complimentary toiletries included only small bars of soap and nothing else i expected a supply of tooth paste and brush and shaving set at the price we paid i also expected breakfast to be included
