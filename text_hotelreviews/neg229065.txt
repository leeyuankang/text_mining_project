the hotel staff are lovely but the location is in a terrible place also no bar facilities and no parking they were changing the boiler the last day of our trip so no hot water after in the morning which we were not advised of at first also the air conditioning stopped working twice during our stay no drawers in rooms either and no plug sockets near mirror to allow us to dry hair straighten hair in front of them
