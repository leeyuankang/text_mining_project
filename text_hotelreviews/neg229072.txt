the hotel is not located in a very good neighborhood the poor man at the front desk was not well informed as it was only his second day and he was completely alone and didn t even have access to things like towels we reserved a twin room and when we got into the room it had one double bed when we went to the desk he said they had no other rooms but then he thought we could change with someone else who also had problems with their reservation we then had to wait to swap rooms with a couple who actually requested a double bed but they had already been in the room and there was no housekeeping to tidy the room or to provide fresh towels so we had to swap towels and toiletries ourselves the beds were very small which made for an uncomfortable night they claim to be a four star hotel but they are far below that
