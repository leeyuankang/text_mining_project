the staff that was at the reception desk at when i checked in that evening was the rudest person i have ever met first when i arrived he asked me what do you want in a rude manner then gave me a lecture about not smoking in the room because if you do we will find out about it when i said politely that if i wanted to smoke i would do so outside the hotel no problem then went on to give me a lecture about letting the cleaners do my room the next day because they have children and husbands to go back to and no time to waste finally when i asked where was my luggage which i had left in their secure store room that morning he pointed out at my bag which was left in the corridor out of their sight and there available for anyone to open it and take my belonging out of it absolutely shocking will never stay in this hotel again and would recommend the managers to get rid of this person at the desk
