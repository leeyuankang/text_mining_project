cost of the food is quite pricey would suggest to look for other eating places in the room the only drink facility is a tassimo so if you like them then fine but i much prefer a kettle so i can make a decent cup of tea the noise from the above room was very annoying as every time they walked you could here the floors creak you could also hear them talking bed was very hard and uncomfortable for me
