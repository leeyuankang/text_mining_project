breakfast appears to be a reasonable hotel rate but is actually when the vat and service charge are added however it is an option and you can always choose to go elsewhere as we did as a petite individual it is frustrating that in our overbath shower the shower head was fixed high on the wall a minor niggle i suppose but a flexible shower arrangement is always a bonus however they do provide those very sexy shower caps to keep your hair dry maybe the better rooms have flexible shower arrangements
