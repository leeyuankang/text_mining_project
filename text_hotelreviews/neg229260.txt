the layout of the cooked breakfast could have been better it was layed out so that you got your items from the heated trays for bacon etc then had to wait for the egg s to be cooked while your other items were getting cold not pleased that on top of the price of breakfast was a surcharge also for drinks at the bar i expect to pay a little more in an hotel but not also the surcharge because of that we only drank there once we went to a pub after that another thing was while having breakfast on the first day a mouse ran across the dining room
