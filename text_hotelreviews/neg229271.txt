i was provided with room with view on the street very noisy room you can hear everything from the street i asked receptionist to change my room he did it but higher floor also noisy i asked him again to change the room he refused because no rooms anymore at the same time booking com offered plenty options in the hotel i don t believe that no room it s just personal attitude of stuff i told him if he didn t change my room i will make bad rating for hotel and he told me i can go on i did it with pleasure highly not recommend this hotel very impolite stuff very noisy room very old furniture terrible smell in room hope hotel saved a lot of money for my days accommodation to provide uncomfortable room all best
