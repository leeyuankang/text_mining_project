had to order eggs for your breakfast which was a palaver they then brought them to your table and then you could get your full english to go with it on checkout we were not given a bill just told the amount to pay which was more than we had been quoted on querying the amount we were told we had been charged a service charge for the breakfast service and another for the accommodation this was almost more than expected and we weren t even told about this charge we were advised it was discretionary so could remove it but made to feel bad when we said we didn t want to pay it
