the bed was extremely uncomfortable my parents stayed at a well known reasonable chain and had an amazing nights sleep whereas our bed was really hard and gave me a back back which lasted for days breakfast wasn t included in the price whereas my parents hotel price did include breakfast and there hotel was less than half the price disappointing i tried to speak to the front desk but they said no one else had ever complained and it was too late to do anything i ve stayed in a lot of lovely hotels and clearly the only reason they can charge the price they do is the location but my parents hotel wasn t far away and like i said above less than half the price in future i won t be a snob and snub the well known chains
