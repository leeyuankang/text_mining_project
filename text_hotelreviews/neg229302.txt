i didn t like the fact that due to an all night party right outside my bedroom window i did not actually sleep at all whilst staying at this hotel partygoers were smoking right outside my bedroom window until see picture after advising of this at checkout i was told this would be escalated after not hearing anything for a week i emailed the manager and got an offer of a free upgrade which i found insulting seeing as though i actually missed a full nights sleep and had a business meeting the next morning i expected at least the offer of a free nights stay to give the hotel another chance to redeem themselves given i travel for business a lot i emailed them back a week ago and have heard nothing since i have given the hotel plenty of opportunity to respond before writing this review i do not usually complain however i feel strongly about my experience at this hotel and felt i should warn others that a good nights sleep is not guaranteed
