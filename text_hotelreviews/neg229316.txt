it gives the impression of being grander and a bit more special than the reality the restaurant looked very unappealing and since breakfast was not included in the rate we went elsewhere reception staff were a bit cold and not especially welcoming i wasn t asked whether i agreed to add a service charge but it was just added to my bill as a matter of principle i complained and got it back as i wasn t aware i had experienced any service altogether rather disappointing and the only possible justification for the price is the location
