we had originally thought we would have breakfast in the hotel on the day we were leaving but changed our mind we were there for and there were x people waiting in front of us for a table we noticed that there were many tables empty but they had not been cleared away we went to get the cooked breakfast but there was very little left and most needed refilling we decided to eat elsewhere it felt like the hotel was short of staff it was a very disappointing experience
