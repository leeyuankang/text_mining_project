i did not like the location of our room although it was very nice the view from the window which was impossible for us to open was of a large cement pad it gave me claustrophobia the manager argued me out of a change was not pleased the lobby and very empty restaurant are not user friendly but the world is at your fingertips just outside the door so all was ok
