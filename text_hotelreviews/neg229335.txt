having booked this hotel in march but had to change date before this change the booking had been paid in full at the time what we were not best happy with on checking out we were given a bill to cover the change in euro in the difference from paying in march in full to sept in using booking when they already had been paid fully in advance i have been to london a few time lately an no other place did this is a very poor way to make more money with the lame excuse of the change in euro as they had our card info they could still of took the payment
