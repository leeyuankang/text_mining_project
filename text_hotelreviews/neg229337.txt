i booked the room on this site but my wife arrived before me as we were travelling from different parts of the country unfortunately she wasn t allowed to go into the room without a bit of fuss even after offering to pay eventually after persisting the manager agreed and took a swipe of her card and allowed access to our room there is also no parking at this hotel despite being able to request parking an ncp is quite close however
