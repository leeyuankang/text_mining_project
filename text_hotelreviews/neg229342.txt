didn t like the idea of one nights holding fee as had already prepaid for the room have not come across this at other hotels this did take a little bit of sorting out but the manager was very helpful in dealing with this query there is also a holding fee for any use of the mini bar in the room all monies reimbursed the next day very efficient notice of these holding fees on website wouldn t go amiss overall would book again
