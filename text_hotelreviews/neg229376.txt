the restaurant was so bad ordered olives with our drinks which were forgotten starters arrived and my partners was a pork shoulder when he d ordered a baked mushroom they took it away and left me with mine we waited for a patheticly small mushroom to be placed in front of him with no apology at all main course we both ordered chicken which was so dry it was hard to swallow we actually gave up on it and left we eat in sway next door which was fantastic the bed was two singles put together which had an uncomfortable lump in the middle and the pillows were like hard sand bags
