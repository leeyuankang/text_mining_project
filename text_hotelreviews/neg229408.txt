only enough tea bags and milk for one cup each per day although in fairness they were happy to bring more up when requested although still rationed to sufficient for one cup of tea each i don t think its unreasonable when staying for two nights to have sufficient provision to have tea on arrival and a cup in the morning small point but seemed a bit mean get breakfast outside at bill s or paul s much better value
