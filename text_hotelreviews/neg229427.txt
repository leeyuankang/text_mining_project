the hotel staff are belligerent to the reality of their actions we had rooms for business were charged twice with no apology until we complained and if you are hoping to sleep make sure you ask for a back of building room as the constant fights at outside that are complimented by the rude staff members motor bike which is alarmed with a pedestrian warning beep every seconds will surely ruin your impression of london real shame as perfect location clean hotel just let down by ignorance and inability to provide a service
