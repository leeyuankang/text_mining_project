the room very basic websites stated home made cookies ipod docking station and complimentary toiletries there were no cookies or biscuits of any description and no ipod docking station the complimentary toiletries consisted of a shower gel dispenser fixed to the shower and hand soap by the sink very misleading for a star establishment i would rate the accommodation as no more than stars but the pub its menu breakfast and staff definitely stars free parking very good
