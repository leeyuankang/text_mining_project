this is a small hotel so doesn t have too many staff not all staff spoke english either so i had to wait to check in for an english speaking member of staff i waited for close to an hour after being told i could check in at it was a little frustrating after a morning of travel staff were eager to please but don t expect the exceptional service you might get from a bit chain i guess that is why you choose this place lots of character fabulous location and very easy to access and all the perks of a small boutique hotel just misses that polish you get from some very well oiled hotels i d stay there again namely for the location and proximity to everything
