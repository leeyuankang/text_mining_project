the bar in the lobby you can help yourselves to drinks which is a lovely idea but the prices are twice the price of a bar where they would be serving you the drink no water at this bar that was complimentary even though tap water is drinkable i had to drink from at tap in the toilet to take some medication or go all the way back to my room not such a bad thing but it just annoyed me
