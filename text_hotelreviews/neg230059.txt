if you have a standard room as our friends had the rooms can be exceedingly small some of the smallest i have seen even though you could be paying up to pounds a night the prices in the bar and restaurant were high so i would eat and breakfast at one of the places around the corner or take the train from gloucester road station and go elsewhere as we had a deluxe room we took the option of paying an extra each for breakfast at the hotel restaurant but the breakfast was a bit ordinary for the price so next time we would breakfast at a local cafe
