my single room was advertised as having a fridge and b o tv it had neither room service did provide a large ice bucket on request the tv s hdmi sockets were locked out so i couldn t use my it is best to describe the wardrobe as a hanging space basically a shelf mounted to the wall with a hanging rack under it other than reaching the very high shelf there is nowhere for smaller items the room was very small indeed despite the ensuite bathroom having a full sized bath with shower overhead you couldn t close the bathroom door it caught on the bottom of the bed ok for sleeping in but that s about it nothing much of a view out of the window i d pay a little more for a better room next time i assume the more expensive rooms do have a fridge and a better tv still for a room in that part of town wasn t awful considering it included breakfast which was if paid for separately
