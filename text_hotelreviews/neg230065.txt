when we arrived the staff was unable to give us a room with two beds as we had requested with our reservation instead they offered two single rooms next to each other and included breakfast at no extra charge although the offer was okay one of the two rooms was so so small there was no closet or armoire nowhere to place the suitcase and only one available electrical outlet although the staff subsequently offered a replacement room upon request the tiny room should not have been offered in the first place
