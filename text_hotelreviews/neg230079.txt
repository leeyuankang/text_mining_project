there was lack of communication between shifts we ask for transportation to the airport and valets to pick up our luggage fom the afternoon staff and the morning staff knew nothing about these arrangements the transportation arrived or more minutes late don t know because we left with a hailled taxi on our own for the amount that radisson charges for a room service should be spot on and it wasn t it was friendly and accommodating but then the requests weren t carried out the rooms are small one more minor complaint was that my tv kept going off line i was watching a good movie that i never got to watch to the end the front desk did send someone up to rebout it but minutes later it went off again i then just went to bed
