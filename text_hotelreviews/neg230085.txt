the room was incredibly noisy it seemed like there was some kind of plant room right next door so the wall against which the bed was placed was literally humming all night long it was like sleeping in an engine room when we told the reception staff about this upon check out we were basically told that it was our fault for not reporting it and asking to be moved get real it was after midnight when we got to our room did they really think that two very tired travellers would be ready to jump out of bed get dressed and race around the hotel to look for another room
