room was poor standard considering it was an executive arrived at to find room still not ready despite booking at least months in advance prices for room service and drinks were astronomical food in scoff and banter apart from starter was of poor quality especially the burger that stated it came with lancashire bomb cheese when in fact it was a square of processed cheese we come from the north of england where lancashire bomb is a delicacy the booking stated towards drinks food etc as we booked an executive room that is that was never offered having stayed in at least radisson blu hotels and have always been very satisfied this one was by far the worst and a great disappointment it was no better than a budget hotel at a ridiculous price the one good comment was the concierge who was on duty when we arrived and thursday and friday daytimes as well he was helpful pleasant and a credit to the hotel
