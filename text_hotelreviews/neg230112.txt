the room is super tiny as compared to all neighborhood hotels whereby even offer cheaper price the breakfast has the same menu every single day throughout our days stay the housekeeper s cleaniliness quality is poor the bathroom is so small yet the chair is freaking heavy to move around that tiny area there is no bottle opener for guest to enjoy our own purchased wine nor beer guest has to bring the bottle down to open worse facility than star hotel
