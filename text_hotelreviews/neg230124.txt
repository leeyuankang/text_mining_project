the service in the bar was a little strange the staff didn t seem to understand what a splash meant in the whisky so my husband didn t get any water added to his whisky and we had to remind them that we needed to pay the service at breakfast was very poor i asked for tea but whilst i was away from the table selecting my breakfast the tea was delivered to the table when i returned i found that there was no milk i went in search but found nothing my husband asked a member of staff and they said they would bring it i had almost finished my breakfast when i fetched some orange juice as i was now desperate for a drink my husband asked for a second time and eventually milk was delivered to the table this was such a shame as the food and everything else about the hotel was very good but this spoilt the overall experience as it was the last impression we had of the hotel as we left
