original room given smelled very strongly of smoke incredible given the no smoking policy of the hotel which you are made to sign on arrival the room re allocated had a shower so small it was very uncomfortable and difficult to shower in as we had booked a de luxe room we expected a much better standard of room the hot food on the breakfast buffet was cold on the two mornings we had breakfast ridiculous given the price of the room no fried eggs at breakfast also had to keep waiting for the food to be replenished as there was insufficient out to cater for the guests only one choice of draught beer on offer peroni no choice is very poor for a hotel of this standard the service charge that applies to every purchase at the bar regardless needs to be clearly explained at check in and not just appear on your bar statement overall a very disappointing stay at a central london hotel
