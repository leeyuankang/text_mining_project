unfortunately our experience was ruined by the fact that i left my make up bag full of rather expensive make up and my watch on the bathroom shelf and by the time i realised this when i got home that evening they were mysteriously nowhere to be found very bad taste as i know that i left them there and they were not handed into lost property by the cleaning staff
