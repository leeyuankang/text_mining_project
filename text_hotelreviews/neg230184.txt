the restaurant was a disappointment my husband was served a very burnt pie and the waiter said just ignore that it would take too long to make you another one we aren t fussy about food and he was happy to eat the pie it would ve been nice if it had come with an apology or a little off the bill our cutlery wasn t changed in between courses but other tables were our drinks order was incorrect and we waited over an hour for dinner about on saturday night a cleaner knocked on our door for no particular reason they ended up getting us some more milk which was wonderful but we were allready in bed at that stage and it seemed a little strange and intrusive around we were woken up by what i think was a fire alarm going off in the building we were given numerous passes to our room in total but only worked the whole time having said that the hotel staff were always willing and happy to help
