the first room was a shock compared to the high standard of the public areas and looked nothing like the photos on the website not what i expected of a star hotel despite getting a good deal tiny room for the twin bed booking with a floor that creaked and moved at every step and a somewhat poorly cleaned toilet complained and was moved to another room and given complimentary breakfast much bigger comfortable room and better however shame about the outdated dark wood furniture horrible d cor and carpet bathroom was tiny but manageable and ok if you are big you may not fit same with the lift however again the toilet needed industrial cleaner or replacing disappointed by both rooms as i deliberately booked a star as i normally stay in star hotels and hostels which have had nicer rooms
