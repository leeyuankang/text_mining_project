the bathroom was small for the size of the room but not sure much can be done about that and also the shower head could be bigger giving the standard of the room the shower head could use an upgrade also downstairs slamming of doors was a bit annoying and the loud music from the restaurant could be heard in our room these are all small things that were noticed but nothing too major to disrupt the stay
