everything was great however we order a taxi from the airport through the hotel the taxi driver charge us instead of as said by the hotel plus we order the same taxi driver for the way back and we agreed on to get to gatwick the taxi driver agreed and when he dropped us off he asked how many are you going to give me so i replied as we said and he replied i would be very happy if you could give me i reply that we agreed on and that we just had that much money in cash he said that we could give him i said no as we agreed on the amount before and the driver left us quite angry i thought he was not very honest and left us on a bad impression before taking our plane
