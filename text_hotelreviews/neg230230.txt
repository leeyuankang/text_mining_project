i felt it was very very average for a radisson blu that happens to be in such a great location photos not indicative at all of a double room and the facilities listed were not available very disappointed as it was supposed to be a romantic night in town and the double room did not feel as luxurious as the information photos indicated there were no bathrobes no mini bar no ipod dock and the room felt very below average for the price paid
