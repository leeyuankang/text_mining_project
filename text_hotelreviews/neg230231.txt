the room was very small with a bathroom door which only opened a third as the washbowl stopped it there was no bedside table on one side of of the bed as there was no room and where does one put a drink book and glasses we asked for a change after one night and although the room was still small it was a little better the single beds were uncomfortable and sloped so it was difficult to lie in a comfortable position and at aged and this was difficult we felt the hotel was tired and needed up grading we would not stay there again although the staff were very pleasant
