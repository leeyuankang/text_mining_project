the hotel has spent money on all the public areas but the bedroom we stayed in was looking very tired decor wise but the bathroom really needs upgrading the bath had been repaired at some point and the plastic coating was pealing off the grouting on the marble was very stained and the all the bathroom sealant on the taps soap holders etc was very messy and therefore makes the bathrooms harder to keep clean the toilet flush was not working properly the phone next to the bed was broken which was reported to reception so when i ordered room service at the bar the waiting staff were not familiar with the room menus as we were only staying for the night and leaving very early the next day these things were just annoyances but if i was staying for any length of time i would have asked for another room
