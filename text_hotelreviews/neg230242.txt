the room was nothing like the image v small and cramped family accommodation bed settee for the children was so uncomfortable they both slept on the floor when we went down for breakfast nobody to greet so wondered through the breakfast area and got shouted at by a member of staff to come out as not any room lack of food prepared and had to wait for a considerable amount of time for food to be brought out the toaster was a domestic one which had seen better days and basically took an eternity to toast the bread so just gave up poor quality and very over priced
