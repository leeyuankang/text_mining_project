one room was a tiny single but ok the double room was basically a single room with a double bed squeezed in at double the cost and this ploy was made all the more blatant by a small table only one chair and only one bedside table and lamp and one had to climb over the bed to get to the other side this is why i gave the lowest score for value for money also the room to room phone service did not work and was not fixed despite alerting the staff and two room cards failed and had to be replaced the tv is rather complicated and it might be easy accidentally to incur extra charges
