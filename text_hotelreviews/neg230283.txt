the building is nice and in a good location for our trip but the experience as a whole was very disappointing for the amount of money we paid we definitely expected at better level of service and facilities breakfast and dinner were very poor we ve paid the same amount of money else where and got better service and a bigger room a premier inn would have been better value for money this time round
