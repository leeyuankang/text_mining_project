we were booked for twin beds got a double very small room with dirty old carpets and an extremely small bathroom with stained toilet breakfast was chaotic not enough tables a long cue and the cooked food was not hot the staff were nice and doing their best but not an impressive place to stay upstairs it needs to be completely refurbished i would rate the lifts and passageways upstairs as a bad hazard in case of emergency overall i would try and find somewhere else to visit
