vent in bedroom dripped water and the bathtub was a death trap no bathmat and difficult to get into nearly fell twice getting in and out hairs found on the bedsheets when i came back to my room one evening at the housekeeper was standing in the middle of the room looking surprised that was truly odd staff held my luggage the day i checked out and when i returned to retrieve it they couldn t find it and asked me where it was how on earth should i know you re the ones who took it room was near the lift and was extremely loud at all hours of day and night with drunk guests coming in and shouting down the corridor and no sound proofing it would seem great location and decor in the corridors stay let down by oddly behaved staff wayward hairs and a dripping vent wouldn t return and fwiw this is the last time i ll choose a radisson blu they always seem to be a bit odd
