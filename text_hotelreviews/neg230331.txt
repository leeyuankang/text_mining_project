we arrived at the hotel at and we were greeted by a friendly receptionist who gave us the key to our room upon entering the room i spotted t shirts on the bed and thought how lovely to receive complimentary nightwear looking round the room i then spot slippers and a toilet bag and realized to my astonishment that we were in someone else s room needless to say we vacated that room very quickly luckily no one was in the room we proceeded to go back to reception and explained the situation he was very apologetic and gave us the key to our room the room we were given was a single superior but we were so tired by now that we couldn t face going back down again i had actually booked a double room my husband had an uncomfortable night i m sure had we had the right size bed it would have been fine
