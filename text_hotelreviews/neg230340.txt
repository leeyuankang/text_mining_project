arrived back to the hotel after after a long day and looking forward to a rest before going to dinner and theatre only to find the room hadn t been serviced the sign was on the door requesting the room be cleaned a complaint was made to the front desk who were right on it but we couldn t rest in case the cleaner arrived she did arrive just before we were leaving for dinner about as this fault couldn t be fixed in time we believe we shouldn t have been charged for that day otherwise we enjoyed our stay and would very likely return again when in london
