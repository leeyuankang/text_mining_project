the fact the room wasn t ready when we arrived we were put on the floor as far away as possible from the lift i m sure considering we requested a ground floor room i was traveling with my mum who will be this month and can t walk too far in one go we only stayed nights but had rooms we were moved to the ground foot for the second night but still quite a way to walk i don t like having to swap rooms once i m checked in because you don t seem to get chance to relax properly breakfast was cold on the first morning but at least they cooked some fresh for me i think they had started to turn things off because it wasn t very busy
