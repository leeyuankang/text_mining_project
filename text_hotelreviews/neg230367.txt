i had a single room which was only slightly cheaper than my friends double room all booked together the room door opened onto a narrow set of stairs to another door and the room which was so tiny that the single bed took all the space with no room for a small suitcase i had to leave my suitcase at the bottom of the stairs and squeeze past it to go in and out while quaint it definitely was not comfortable
