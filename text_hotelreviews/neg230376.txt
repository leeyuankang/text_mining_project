extra small room i ve never been to a hotel with such small rooms the distance from wall to wall could fit only one bed and if you wanted to go across you had to jump through the bed naturally the bathroom pretty clean was also small but had a bath tub so thumbs up for that the mini fridge with no mini bar was stored in the wardrobe along with hair drier iron and some other stuff so no place for clothes extremely small and old tv the corridors were very narrow and dark i would have expected more for pounds night
