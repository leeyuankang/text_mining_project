day staff were fantastic however night staff were horrendous we booked a second night and they could only offer us a double and two singles we had booked two doubles and they couldn t understand why i might want to actually share a room with my husband it took hours to sort out and in the end we were put in a taxi and taken to a different hotel who were very rude and unhelpful also a radisson it was very frustrating to constantly be told that the new hotel was doing us a favour extremely poor customer service we were hoping to end our weekend with a few drinks in the bar however it was by the time we were actually checked in we wished we had found somewhere on our own but it was too late
