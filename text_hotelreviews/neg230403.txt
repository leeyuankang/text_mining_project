the front desk staff left a lot to be desired very unprofessional the bathtub is deep and narrow making it very dangerous to get in and out of be very careful had a friend drop off something for us and was never notified and i email and asked to have it sent on to us but never received a response typical i must say the location was great making this hotel worth dealing with
