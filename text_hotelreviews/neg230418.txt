our deluxe room looked like that of a premier inn when we complained that the amount of money we were spending on staying in that room was not proportionate we were told that was their best deluxe room we were moved to one of their newly renovated rooms and it was far superior to what we were given initially for a start the room was twice the size and so was the bathroom our new room also had a settee in it another thing we were not too pleased about was that whilst waiting for our new room to be ready we had to wait over an hour we decided to have a drink in the bar pints of peroni came to as it included a service charge for them to pass the glasses over the bar to us and an hours wait for my sandwich from room service when i was told it would be minutes
