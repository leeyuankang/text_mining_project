when we left we asked the front desk in the lobby to order a taxi for us when i order a taxi in london i expect it to be a london cab or at least a cab from a recognized regulated and above board company this didn t happen when it turned up it was a private car not marked as a taxi no meter or anything that normally comes with a taxi and at least the staff in the lobby should have asked me if it was ok to order a non taxi i could of course have rejected it but was a bit pushed for time and therefore the weak part in this when we arrived at victoria the driver asked an exorbitant when we arrived in london on monday the same trip from victoria to cromwell road cost and taxi trip calculators for london gives the price for that trip at poungs so this non taxi driver charged three time the going rate there is no other way to describe this as a totally unacceptable rip off even though the hotel is well located the staff is friendly etc the incident described above means that i will never return to that hotel or any other hotel in the same chain i hope you will post this on your website so that other customers are warned off this hotel
