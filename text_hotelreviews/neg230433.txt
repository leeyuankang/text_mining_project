shower temperature very inconsistent either it was cold or scolding hot had issues with our first room as well it was supposed to be a nicer room deluxe but could hardly squeeze into the bed given the walls that stuck out and the bathroom was very narrow and small upgraded to a much nicer suite but again the bathroom was very narrow and again the water was inconsistent
