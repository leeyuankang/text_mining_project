deeply disappointed after staying in a radison blu hotel in glasgow twice we found toe nail clippings on the bedroom floor we found a housekeeper to vacuum them up but that should not have been needed lady booking us in forgot to tell us what time breakfast was and where it was located room generally tired with very little natural day light i do wonder if the booking was made via bookiing com if we were given an inferior room
