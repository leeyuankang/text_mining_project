first day we were sat down down quickly and staff were helpful the second day they were rushed off their feet and we were left standing to be sat at a table it wasnt until i got fed up with waiting and sat my family down myself did they come over to say the table id chosen wasnt suitable and moved us it was then that i noticed the breakfast menu which wasnt on the table on our first day so we werent aware that there was alternatives to the buffet i asked for poached eggs and later had to ask again by which time my family had finished as for the buffet it had been emptied and we had to wait for that to be replenished as well not good
