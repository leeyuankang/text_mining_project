when booking months in advance i specifically requested to not be near a lift due to noise when checking in i again asked that it was a quiet room not near a lift which was confirmed the room provided was right next to the lift which when raised with reception led to being shown another room next to the lift and a twin room there were no other options available so we had to stay in the room and put up with noise from customers and staff chatting when entering and exiting the lift
