to start with the room was tiny i literally had to crawl over my husband if i needed to use the bathroom at night there obviously are problems with hot water and water pressure the bathroom was as tiny as in a star parisian hotel we also didn t like the service there was supposed to be a concierge service but even reaching the reception by telephone was a pain night receptionists were far from being helpful we even failed to send a postcard as were advised to go to the post office and do it by ourselves think it s kind of mean taking into account the hotel is supposed to be luxurious
