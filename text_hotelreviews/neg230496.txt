we couldn t have the breakfast at the hotel came down on sunday just after breakfast until on sunday s and were confronted by a massive queue of people waiting for a table from what we could see and smell the breakfast must have been real good unfortunate there was no seating for the guests that night so we went out and had breakfast at a little cafe near the tube station
