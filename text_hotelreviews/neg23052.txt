the room i had was at the back of the hotel on the first floor overlooking the back yards of another apartment building i did not mind the lack of view as i had not booked for this however because of this the room was a bit darker than normal and lacked character it needed a bit more wall and furniture decor for it to feel a bit more welcoming than just a basic hotel room
