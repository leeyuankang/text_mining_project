i chose radisson for ensuring the service standard unfortunately that was what i hadn t experienced during my entire stay the housekeeper started to wake up the guests at a m by knocking their doors and asking whether they need housekeeping service the hotel refused to extend the breakfast time on of january resulted in the guests queuing in the corridor waiting for an cleaned table inevitably it is no longer an enjoyable experience as all the staffs were overwhelmed
