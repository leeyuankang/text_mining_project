our room was tiny there was hardly any room for my partner and i to move let alone get changed and eat breakfast the mini bar was totally empty there was no bin no bedside tables and no soft lighting just spotlights on the ceiling really disappointing i think i requested a quiet room so perhaps the rooms at the back of the hotel are smaller than all the others
