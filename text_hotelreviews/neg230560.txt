there was a problem with our booking for the first night of our stay and we had to spent one night in a small dark room which was very disappointing fortunately the room was changed the following day and the hotel offered a complimentary meal the hotel arranged a taxi to take us to heathrow with a fixed charge which seemed far too expensive as the journey wasn t longer than minutes
