our first room allocated had a noise problem air cond and was very small for a standard double no drawers for storing clothes and wardrobe had a mini fridge so blouses shirts trousers did not hang properly staff were gracious checked out noise problem and subsequently moved us to another standard double room which was much more spacious and to our expectations for a star hope the room is not allocated again as a double more like a single thought the idea of having to pay extra for a second thimble full of gravy at dinner was unbelievable
