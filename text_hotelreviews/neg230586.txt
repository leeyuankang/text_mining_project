bathroom so tiny my fianc struggled to be in there without having the door open to use the toilet or to get dry smallest bathroom i have ever seen and that was with a king size room horrendous ques for breakfast people deep not what i expect from this hotel chain excellent head waiter through meal then sadly he disappeared and we got forgotten after our evening meal waited mins even for any eye contact from a staff member i ordered coffees and the bill only to be told another mins later that the coffee machines were now shut down sorry coffee was not available it was only pm dissapointing
