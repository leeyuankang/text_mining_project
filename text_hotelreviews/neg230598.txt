entering into the hotel lobby it looked fine but after that our experience was very poor particularly that this hotel is rated as four star no way we had booked two separate rooms but the reception staff tried to fob us off with a twin room both of the rooms allocated were red hot and we were unable to open the windows of either room to let some fresh air in reception were contacted to try and rectify the problem one room had the heating adjusted down the other remained red hot despite reception being notified again and asked to attend to it while we were at our evening meeting so a sleepless night in oven like conditions the rooms were dusty so cleanliness not of the best standard and very small in size so much so it was a squeeze along the side of the bed to close the curtains as the mattress was plonked onto a wooden box base the reception staff had a take it or leave it attitude you would be best looking elsewhere for a better service premier inn is a better stay and the rooms are cheaper i have stayed at radisson blu hotels before the last time in norway and the service was excellent avoid this one go elsewhere just as we will be
