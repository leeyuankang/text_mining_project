bad experience with three clowns working behind the bar on slow service sorry very slow no peanuts available or tidbits one staff member said we had seen another staff member put a large plastic container with peanuts under the bar eventually we were served peanuts bar started closing at as a resident in a hotel in the uk i would expect alcohol to be served somewhat later than that after some discussion with the barman we eventually got another round about second night same problem with peanuts my friend called the restaurant manager a very tall gentleman who immediately solved the problem i was then served a pint of picotini lager withe about of froth on top i politelye asked could it be topped up to be told it was to the line on another empty glass the barman was unbale to show me a line he then topped up the glass and slammed it on the bar and disappeared this night there was no notice of times up all bar staff simply disappeared about pm leaving plus rugby supporters devoid of drink frankly if those three young men don t like working behind a bar or being in the service industry then they should get out out of it their attitude reflects badly on the hotel
