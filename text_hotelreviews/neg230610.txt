by comparison to other radisson hotels at which we have stayed in europe this was disappointing the cost of hotel accommodation in london has become ridiculously expensive and quality of service and accommodation at this hotel would not make me want to rush back other radisson hotels are less expensive and better eg d sseldorf milan dublin sligo etc
