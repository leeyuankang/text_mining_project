room service was poor on the first morning i tried to telephone for about forty minutes nobody answered the phone eventually reception rang to tell me they had tried to ring our room for about half an hour which was a blatant lie we got our breakfast eventually the tv reception was poor the shower temperature was poor as soon as somebody flushed the toilet etc the water was either cold or boiling in my opinion it was not value for money but i must say that the staff were kind and friendly if you run a busy hotel like that please make sure the toilets are working please make sure you have enough staff no i would not go again
