we made our booking about months prior to our stay we booked a twin room we arrived at around hour after check in time and our room was not ready we were offered single rooms which i thought was a pretty ludicrous offer considering we had booked a twin room oh and they were so kind to advice that this was at no extra cost when we were finally given a room we then discovered that there was no iron we reported this to reception and the housekeeper had to check our room to see that there was no iron it was obvious to see that there wasn t an iron anywhere before she then fetched an iron
