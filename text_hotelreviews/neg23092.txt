was asked to eat my breakfast at the bar because the dining room was full and i was alone i did this willingly but of course it s not as comfortable as being at a table the bathroom door closes in on your knees when sitting on the toilet if you re tall like me had a few problems working out how to switch of the air conditioning finally worked out that you have to take the key out of the slot
