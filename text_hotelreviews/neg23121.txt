the hotel was very noisy especially the bar and breakfast due to a large business meeting going on breakfast was a little disappointing with only a buffet and no a la carte options the buffet itself had a lovely selection but the hot food was overstocked so the food was not of the best quality eggs rubbery sausages dry the coffee was over held and stewed
