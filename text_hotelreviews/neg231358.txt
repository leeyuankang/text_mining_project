room was small many sex shops nearby but the sad thing is that we were robbed at the metro when leaving the hotel heading to the airport if i could give an advice do not take the metro if you are with luggage get a cab or an uber to go to the hotel from the airport or vice versa it is not worth it for the price and safety there were about girls around years old that entered with us in metro and distracted us you could not tell that they were willing to get your money they got my husbands wallet and all the money that was inside watch your belongings in paris
