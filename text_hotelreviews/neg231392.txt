as we checked in on july and we find the a c of the room not working properly and we asked the hotel to change the room but they say there is no more twin bed room but it s showing in booking com and no wifi in the room we have to go in the lobby to connect to the wifi also there is no safe box in the room too so how come the rating of this hotel is star
