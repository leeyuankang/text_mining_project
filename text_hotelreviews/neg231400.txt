there was a smell off sewerage in the reception area which was obviously coming from just outside we did comment on this but it didn t become apparent through out the rest of the hotel the area around the hotel at night time is a place where you need to be wary it s right in the middle of a strip of sex shops which is fine but we did see a few unsavoury characters so we were careful with our belongings this said there is some lovely cafes bars nearby too so it s beautiful during the day
