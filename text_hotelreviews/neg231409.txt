from appearance and service the hotel seems more a medium quality stars hotel than a stars location is well connected but not a classy area of paris apart the sexy shops at the entrance of the surrounding lap dance bars personnel is very pushy in inviting you in the interior of the hotel is oldish for the common areas internet connection was practically useless and just cause of frustration complained several times to staff but they were already aware of the connectivity issue and could take no action outside is very noisy also at late hours in general i would not recommend the hotel since in my previous stays in the city i enjoyed much better comfort and at lower prices
