it was unfortunate that the people in the next room were so loud we were awake until a m when i had to go and ask them to be quiet especially as we had specifically asked for a quiet room the hotel couldn t have known of course but we were also in a room facing the main road though traffic noise was not bad the second night was perfect the loud music in the reception area and dim lighting in bar area a bit garish
