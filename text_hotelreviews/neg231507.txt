generally we did not think the service was as good as it should have been for the money we paid the bags and rooms were mixed up it seems no efforts were made to address the special requests for room requirements made on the booking breakfast service on the first morning was slow and the greeting on the second morning was not very hospitable upon checkout over of random service charges had been added to the bill even though we had not used anything that cost additional money emphasis on getting money out of the guests rather than ensuring a good service generally a nice hotel but over priced and service not very professional
