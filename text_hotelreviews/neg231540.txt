the only negative feedback i have about this otherwise superb hotel is that they could not arrange for an iron and ironing board i was offered a complimentary pressing of my shirt which was greatly appreciated but this took about an hour to arrange for i was lucky that i was not pressed for time still it was a most enjoyable experience
