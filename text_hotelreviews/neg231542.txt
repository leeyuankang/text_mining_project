we paid for a bed room and unfortunatley was given a roll out bed that was not fit for even a child it took quite a bit of discussion to get it fixed and even then i was provided with another roll out bed albeit with a better mattress the room was advertised as beds but the only temporary not great when spending a lot on accommodation as a treat at the end of a great trip was disappointing it also advertised a rooftop terrace however this was only available to the penthouse apartment
