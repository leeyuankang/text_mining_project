no clear distinction of the hotel on the street if you re not familiar with the streets buildings of london you could easily walk past the hotel and not take notice of it walls floors and room doors are not sound proof i would ve much rather been disturbed by the noise in the streets than from guest neighbors and hotel staff easily hear housekeeping and other staff talking walking frustrating for a five star hotel one would expect sound proof doors at least though the hotel is relatively new the eclectic themed rooms are way outdated most of the room features such as lighting a c and curtains are controlled electronically and sometimes they didn t work properly
