it all start with the reception desk basically nobody smiles the general state of mind is to continuously explain why you can get this or that the problem are all yours and you are bothering them then you get to your room where many things are out of services including the shower that gives either burning hot water or ice cold noway to find a midway the bf is simply absurd you either have a la carte choice next to the reception or a la carte choice in the caf there they would server food first and then later toast that goes with it the idea that they could come together is apparently not yet on there agenda the kids had a very small access window to the swimming pool more or else hour in the morning and one in the afternoon but keep in mind they aren t really welcome in this place and you get the message very clearly from the staff when you see staff anyway in the corridors they wait for your to say hello otherwise they just stare at you the food is very medium level for this kind of hotel the concierge is totally lost you can ask for your car or anything he always has to check what good question but the bottom line is that you have to wait no way to get something in a reasonable time very very disappointing stay way too expensive for the service to be avoided
