the free wifi was a disappointment to have a free wifi that is very slow very was useless i cloud t watch shows any websites with images video would take ages to load the bed and pillows were not that comfortable i hated the pillows the soft one was too soft and the firm one was too firm t t we requested to stay on the floor when we booked which was the biggest mistake to have big windows but we got regular size window which you cannot open or close cause it has a key so every time i had to call for that which was annoying plus the room was right above the bar which meant too much disturbance and frustration to hear noises which surprisingly no one could knew where is it from the cleanliness for me was below average for stars hotel
