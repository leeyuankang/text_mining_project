it wasn t mentioned that the room was a basement room and it was very different from the photographs on booking com the room was extremely dusty and we ended up constantly sneezing whilst in the room after we changed rooms we found the hairdryer not working it took a long time to deal with this in the evening the showers were weak in both rooms one day the keycard for our room stopped working and we had to get it changed overall too many problems
