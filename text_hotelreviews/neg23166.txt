as a premium hotel brand pullman london even don t equipped with a bathtub and the carpet was not cleaned thoroughly but ironically they do charge the premium price more the breakfast experience was horrible the waiter totally forgot my coffee and was indifferent with all the empty dishes on my table when i checking out no one returned my deposit back until i asked repeatedly i highly doubt if i stayed in the fake pullman
