deluxe double was tiny my partner is and hanging off the bed we were next to an elevator so loud noises all night shower was dirty had mould all over it and no pressure tv was on a weird angle so you couldn t see it properly if u have big suit cases very crowded and pillows and bed were uncomfortable but saying that we spent hardly anytime in the room so location was great for us
