i felt and hurt and cut my self badly in the bathtub their tubs are poorly designed they have a incline section at both ends and their shower heads are placed at a point where it forces you to step in the inclined area of the tub and as anyone can imagine if you are showering normally you will be using soap and this makes this inclined area very slippery the air conditioning was not working well and when we asked they sent some one to check but the first question was where are you from which basically meant what do you expect this is the mercure hotel the evening manager did not seemed to enjoy his job always with an attitude
