i did not feel welcome at all my checkin time was around and somehow there was only assistant in the reception the other guy left and did not show up any more the only one person tried her best but for me it looked like a bad organisation of duties my room key did not work they sent me back to the room times after rebooting the key it turned out that the door lock did not work so finally i was given another room but before that i needed to go back and forth with my luggage times trusting their words it should work they offered some drinks as a compensation but the drinks never appeared the hotel looked like needing refurbishment dark and worn off the room was still quite ok the breakfast wasn t expensive however rather limited in choice the service was non existent personnel deliberately speaking french even if they understood that that s not my language
