the staff was a bit rude maybe because of a language barrier we asked the staff to see if they do currency exchange because on their electronic board it showed the currency value and we thought oh that s better than some of the places we saw on the streets and one of the staff said they don t do it in this hotel so she told us to go to montparnasse bienvenue we asked for the name of the currency exchange place but she just told us to go there we got there and we got lost and confused we went to the other mercure s that was in that area but they all had language barriers it was just a waste of time we ended up going to some change place somewhere else we also had a do not disturb sign on our door because we don t feel comfortable people coming into our hotel room with our stuff out in the past we had hotel housekeeper steal things from us so it was just a mindset thing the housekeeper still came into our room and cleaned it up i mean what s the point of having that sign sure we might be a little picky but it s better safe than sorry right what if that happened to you if we needed something we would call down to receptions
