the housekeepers were very annoying we had rooms with a connecting door open at the day of check out the housekeepers knocked and entered both rooms before for several times they obviously wanted to clean and leave work faster but we didn t like to be annoyed like this in our rooms before the check out time this fact spoilt the whole impression of the hotel
