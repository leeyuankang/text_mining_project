this was labeled a star hotel yet no a c only two outlets one of which was by the door so not useful no coffee maker no iron barely any walking room we had a triple room for myself my husband and year old daughter we each got a tiny twin size bed one of which was a spring mattress cot bathtub glass door rubber bottom broken so water leaked all over the floor truly one of the worst hotels i have stayed stayed at another star hotel in london few days prior with a complete opposite experience so i am comparing hotels within the same city
