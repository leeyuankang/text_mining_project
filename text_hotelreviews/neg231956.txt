i chose this hotel for a special weekend away with my wife i had stayed at other grange hotels on business and based on this positive experience i opted for the grange rochester i disliked my trip for three reasons we were staying in a poky top floor room with sloping ceilings i am and it was claustrophobic to put it mildly we didn t wish to spend any more time than absolutely necessary in that room while the room was reasonably appointed it was shabby in parts and in need of a refurb as well as being cramped my second disappointment was during check in when the receptionist beamed at two other guests and told them the good news that they d been upgraded to a better room this only exacerbated my disappointment at our room especially on a special trip i appreciate that not everybody can have an upgrade but there must be a more discrete way of telling the lucky guests who do perhaps take them to one side etc thirdly we arrived before our room was available for check in it was a very hot day and we opted to wait in the air conditioned bar and have a coffee it was impossible to find anybody to serve us and i had to go to reception three times before a waiter finally appeared
