no air conditioning on the hottest weekend of the year but appreciate the weather in the uk is rarely like that disappointed at the fact that the wine bar closed really early when we would have eaten there every night because the food was so good we ve stayed here two years on the trot and would have stayed again the same time next year however i m disappointed that the price seems to have trebled for the same time next year so we won t be returning
