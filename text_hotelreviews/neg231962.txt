the cost of breakfast was extortionate even for london so we ended up at a coffee shop down the road i booked a twin executive room via booking com which advertised a balcony standard twin had same facilities except for a trouser press balcony upon arriving at the hotel we entered our room to find we had been given a standard room and all executive twin rooms were fully booked the staff stated that executive was based on the size of the room not whether a balcony was included hence why i believe this is false advertising on booking com staff ended up putting myself friend in a double room with balcony which we were happy with
