checkin staff made us feel very unwelcome our first time in london we booked this accom in january and we were given a room below street level as if we were a last minute booking very frustrating as we have made dozens of bookings thru this website no view except for a concrete wall couldn t open windows as room not secure room very musty smelt like dirty socks bar fridge locked will never stay with this chain again and probably won t stay in london again due to this experience
