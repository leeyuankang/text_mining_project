our room was in the basement which made it quiet which is a good thing however the room was very small and instead of a proper double bed we had a pull down bed one of those you see in movies in tiny apartments that fold away into a wall cupboard it was like camping out at a friend s house on their emergency guest bed the room was old and tired they tried to dress it up nicely in a classic style but who cares i rather have a proper bed the bathroom was even smaller we asked them to show us a different room which was bigger indeed but even worse it was very tired smelly and dirty with stains on the walls the hotel gives this luxury impression on their website but don t be fooled just because it is old doesn t make it stylish or charming ok it is london and everything is expensive but anywhere else in the world this would rate as a star experience
