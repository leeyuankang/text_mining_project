the price of the breakfast was outrageous especially in view of several establishments close by where you could buy a full english breakfast with coffee for under pounds best place for breakfast is cafe nuvo about a minute walk and is highly used by locals including the policemen which is always a good recommendation it s quite a walk and certainly not a straight shot to either victoria station or st james it took us awhile to figure out how to get to the tube and back to the hotel
