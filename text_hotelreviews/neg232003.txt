they have kept and maintained the grandeur of the place so some may consider it old or dirty but i give them credit for not gutting the place and removing the character of the hotel people who expect renovated sterile properties will not appreciate this hotel carpeting bedding draperies and towels were all new and top quality it is in a quiet residential neighborhood so the streets get quiet at night it felt perfectly safe but it was quiet late at night i was surprised by how expensive it was but compared to other hotels it was a value and my choices were limited because we had adults maybe i just waited too long and didn t get the good room rates
