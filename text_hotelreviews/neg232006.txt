i didn t like the staff that was cleaning the room i was standing in my room just in my underwere and a men from the cleaning room just opened the door with his card also i left some food on the window and went for a walk when i came back it was missing but the most sad event happend when we left i forget my pijama under the pilow i called the same day at the hotel they double looked and said that who was cleaning the room didn t find anything i am convince that i left it under the pilow such a great hotel sould be more carefull with the cleaning staff they have for sure you will find who was gilty in this case because such cases will probably repeat this is the reputation of the hotel and they should be more carefull with their cleaning staff
