lift stopped one floor below then had to walk up two flights of stairs staff always carried heavy case the bath was higher than i have normally experienced therefore difficult to enter for shower the bed was harder than i prefer not as spacious as i would expect from a four star breakfast seriously overpriced in my experience and opinion would have liked but not prepared to pay the price
