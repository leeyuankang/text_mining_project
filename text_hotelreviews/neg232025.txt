we had the executive twin room myself and a teenage niece the beds are very small and uncomfortable we had to move them quite a bit apart to be able to sleep the pillows are subpar as well bathroom was small and constantly wet after showers due to a quarter plastic door with a poor seal although we were checked in early to our room yay we got a room right near the bar which made all night noise a problem sometimes
