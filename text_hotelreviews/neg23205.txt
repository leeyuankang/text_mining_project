booked for people but only one dressing gown provided we don t want to have to ring housekeeping late at night when we just want to retire in comfort the real problem was the wake up call that never came a staff member knocked on the door at too late thankfully my husband had set his mobile just in case i was told that they had been trying to call the room so obviously they called the wrong room or the phone was not working it was fine when the call was originally requested
