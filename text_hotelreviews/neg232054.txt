stayed for six nights in july with my year old daughter the beds were stone hard there were no mattress pad only a hard spring mattress i asked for en extra mattress and got an extra spring mattress on top of the old one that worked only because the new one was softer we did not get any extra for the other bed we bought an air mattress and put on top of that bed ii have a problem with my back and hips but these hard beds could not do anyone happy my daughter had a hard time sleeping until we bought the air mattress the photos showed a more modern room than the actual room the minibar was locked at first and we had to ask for glasses when glasses were used they were removed and not replaced with new ones the minibar use was not replaced
