it was very hot in the room it did have a little fan in a cupboard which i thought was funny when i first got there but realised you needed it they seemed to have a lot of first day new staff in every area when we were there but they were all nice it was clean except for a large stain on one of the bed covers which was there when we arrived and still there when we left days later
