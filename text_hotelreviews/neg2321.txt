the room was very noisy we could hear a fan of some sort outside the bedroom which came on periodically and was very loud every time someone in a room next door above or close to us flushed the loo or had a shower we could hear the water running through the bathrooms open drain the room was very small only one arm chair so when we had room service in the evening one of us had to sit on the bed to eat there is only enough wardrobe space for about things to hang in when i asked why i hadn t got any complementary water i was told it was because i booked through you i made a fuss and did get it in the end but i felt like a cheap skate even though it cost me over for the two nights
