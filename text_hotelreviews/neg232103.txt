extremely noisy street which you expect in a large city however noise reduction was not effective at all short staffed available staff was definitely overworked unable to get a cocktail in bar as concierge was also in charge of serving drinks and delivering room service witnessed other hotel patrons frustration at not being able to a order cocktails not a great value for cost bathroom layout definitely a disaster waiting to happen tub very high to step into and very narrow glass half enclosure potential injury risk
