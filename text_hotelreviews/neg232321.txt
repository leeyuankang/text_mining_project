tiny single room to be expected but this room was so hot there was a portable air conditioning unit in the room that was so noisy you could hear it when you came out of the lift rooms away impossible to sleep with the noise of that and the heat when it was turned off the shower also had a lot of black mold in around the tiles and all of the sealer tiles were cracked and black in between them the bathroom and furniture in the single room leave a lot to be desired and are in desperate need of replacing no way a four star more like two one member of check in staff was also very rude to me they were unable to take card payments when i arrived as there was something wrong with their system she kept telling me to go to a cash point to get cash out to pay for my two nights stay and wanted another cash as a deposit i told her i would do so in a while but wanted to go to my room first as i had a long journey getting to the hotel and wanted to drop my luggage off when i came down about half an hour later she shouted at me across the reception in front of other guests and asked me if i had fixed the problem with my card not only was this incredibly rude and tactless of her it was also very inappropriate as my card was perfectly fine it was their system that was down she made me feel like some kind of low life when i came back with all of the cash for her she started speaking in a foreign language with the porter i couldnt say of she was talking about me as i didnt know the language the other receptionist then kindly asked them to refrain from doing this as they had a guest present and it was very rude of them to do so instead of making me feel like a low life they could of easily just taken payment by my card when their system was up again needless to say i wont be staying there again despite the great location
