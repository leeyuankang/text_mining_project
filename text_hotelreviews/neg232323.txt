when we booked through booking com i booked an air conditioned room which i did not get the stopper in the sink was not working so the water did not drain properly even though i complained nothing was done at all i asked for an iron and ironing board to be kept jn my room while going out but was told that the hotel was full so cannot keep in room and that they would put it in after a couple of hours but not done had to ask for it again the next day n then it was delivered will not return to this hotel would rather pay a bit more and at least get what you booked for
