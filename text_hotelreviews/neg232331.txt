the room was out dated chipped paint dirty stained carpet and tapestries and two very small uncomfortable beds we even booked a room to have one bed as we traveled as a couple and were given a tiny hole of a room it would be the equivalent of staying at a motel in america from the in the middle of all the museum zone of washington dc would not recommend as the price for two nights was close to in us currency spend the extra or more and stay at one of the nicer hotels in the area
