the hotel appears nice however the rooms are terrible very small very old and tired the hands free shower could not reach the wall mount as the hose was too short so you had to hold the shower head with one hand the air conditioner did not work so the room was very hot and stuffy breakfast usually ran out of food and the chairs were lower than the table because the cushions were flattened due to age and use
