the first room had an incredibly noisy air conditioner unit with a large tube venting through a hole in the window because of the tube the window couldn t be opened for fresh air also the mattress felt like there were bars across it when i said that the room wasn t suitable i was told i couldn t move after some heated discussion with the person at the front desk whose english was not adequate i was moved into another room the second day while that room had a decent mattress and air conditioning and the window opened the sink in the bathroom had no water i reported the sink twice and was ignored i had to collect water from the shower in a plastic bottle to brush my teeth i was there on business if i d had time to research other options i would have changed hotels i won t stay there again
