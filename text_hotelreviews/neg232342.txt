tired decor wallpaper missing toilet leaking tiny room large a c unit and a huge gap at the bottom of the room door all gave a poor impression i was expecting a star hotel and a poster bed in our deluxe double room instead we had singlebeds pushed together which took up most of the room space the receptionstaff were good and very helpful the breakfast staff were indifferent bordering on rude breakfast was ok but not the best all in all although it served its purpose the hotel was not what i was expecting and certainly does not deserve to call itself a star hotel
