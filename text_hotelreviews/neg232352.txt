i had asked for a room with a shower with a hose the first room they showed me did not have this facility and the room was very narrow and faced on to the main road with passing traffic noise it could have done with a lot of changes when i complained they put in me a basement room with a double bed suitable wardrobe and other facilities the shower over the bath was on a hose but the basin plug was non existent they tried to make a replacement but that did not work the bathroom could have done with being refurbished there was no traffic noise as the small window faced the back of the lycee francais which was behind the hotel and all one heard was when the pupils were playing football before and after school the lady at reception said as i was in a double room i would have to pay extra i refused the only extra i paid was for continental and full english breakfasts which i had had and were excellent with very helpful staff
