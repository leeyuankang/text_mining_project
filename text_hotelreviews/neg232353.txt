there was nothing i particularly didn t like if i were to be really really picky the room might have been a bit small if i was travelling with my partner but then i am a larger lady so it might not bother others other than that although the room had two hairdryers i was glad i had brought my own as they weren t really suitable for drying long hair again not a problem for the majority of the population and not unusual in hotels
