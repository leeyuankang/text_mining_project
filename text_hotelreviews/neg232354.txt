my single room was very small but adequate for a one night stay at least it had a good en suite floor standing air conditioning unit was very noisy and could not open window as tube from unit went out through window so window was fixed shut however it was very effective in cooling the room quickly on a very hot london day but you would not want it on all night did not sleep very well due to poor quality of pillows one was thin and hard the other very lumpy i did bring this to the attention of the receptionist when i checked out and she said she would change the lumpy one very unusual to see a sign in bathroom saying not to drink tap water and had to pay for a bottle of water if tap water not drinkable i think hotel should provide a bottle of water in room wallpaper rather faded and could do with updating
