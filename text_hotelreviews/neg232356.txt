our room certainly did not resemble any of the ones pictured it was dark gloomy and was at basement level i booked a family room for myself husband and daughter based upon the photographs on the website i would not choose a dark windowless room for my daughter to sleep in and was relieved we were in and out of there prior to the warmer days as i believe it would have been very unpleasant in the airless rooms the shower nozzle was constantly falling off and hitting us on the head the water temperature constantly changed from hot to cold
