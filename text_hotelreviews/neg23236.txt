would have given the staff a higher score but the bar staff and service let the hotel down we were ignored for more than mins at the bar even after drawing this to the staffs attention we waited a further mins there were staff washing glasses staff talking at the till and serving when we did get served they gave us half the order then served others while we had to remind them of this they couldnt remember the part of the order they had aready fulfilled the rest of the group ordered from the table and waited nearly mins to be brought their drinks after waiting mins to order most of our group went elsewhere for drinks as this is probably the worst service we have ever experienced both in the uk and beyond two of the group who are in the industry could not believe the standard of the sevice compared to the rest of the hotel facilites staff we also had one of our group traped in the elevator for mins but that is another story and these things happen
