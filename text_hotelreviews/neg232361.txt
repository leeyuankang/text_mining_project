the room we were allocated was in the basement and definitely not the room in the picture when we booked it had only one window which was up fairly high and the school behind played football every night until about pm and quite often the ball would hit the window at the very least there should be a security grill or something over the window so that the balls from the school do not hit the window the bathroom left more than a little to be desired as the water from the shower would leak through the gap in the glass partition and end up on the floor where we had to use hand towels to mop it up also the t v reception was quite poor and we only could get a couple of channels we also asked for room service one night and were told that we would have to go across the road to your sister hotel and get our own room service if we had realized we were going to be in a star accommodation hotel we would have booked elsewhere
