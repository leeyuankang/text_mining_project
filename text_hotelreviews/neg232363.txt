i reported there were ants in our bed when we woke up in the morning there was also mold between the tiles in the bathroom and the toilet roll holder was not the correct insert for the unit on the wall so as soon as you touch the toilet roll it pings off i was also disappointed that we had to pay an additional for an english breakfast and they went to a property across the road for it not at all professional i feel that we should have some kind of refund to be honest
