the bathroom wasn t up to standard flaking paint on the ceiling dirty marks on the shower screen loose threads on the countertop the door into our room would not shut properly you had to give it a good few strong pulls to get it to lock otherwise anyone could just walk in no drinkable tap water in the room had to pay for water no full english included in the price of hotel which was a shame for the amount we paid
