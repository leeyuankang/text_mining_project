the hotel failed to enter booking com s reservation into the system as a result they double booked on us and we were unable to stay in the hotel for the first of the two nights we had booked worse still we had arrived at the hotel at in the morning on the day of our arrival expecting to be able to leave our bags and spend the rest of the day sight seeing instead we had to spend the whole morning waiting to know whether the hotel would honour the booking or simply leave me and my family on the street eventually after several hours fobbing us off with excuse after excuse the hotel transferred us to another hotel across the street but only after a very stressful experience we were not alone the hotel had also double booked on a party of six elderly american tourists who were also forced to wait several hours to see if they would have a room for the night the one bright spot was booking com who really stood by us when we telephoned to tell them what was going on without booking com s intervention and strong support for us i really don t know whether the hotel would have found another room for us
