we stayed on the floor the room was cold and we couldn t get the room to warm up for the whole night room service got our order wrong and it was too late to change it the pillows were hard and not of high quality for a star hotel we also booked a classic king room and ended up with a queen size bed check in and check out was slow and when we advised of the problem with the heating reception staff commented that they had received a number of complaints about this if this was the case the problem should have been resolved a long time ago despite being in a convenient location i would hesitate to recommend staying at this hotel the hotel is overly priced
