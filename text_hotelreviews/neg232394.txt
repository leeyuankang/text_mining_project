the bed was rock hard and not much room around it kept tripping over the over blanket there was cobwebs on the light fitting there was a hole in the bath so didn t dare use it and the shower had no power so it just dribbled breakfast was ok i suppose but they kept running out of stuff coffee and rolls the lift sometimes didn t work and the stairs to the top floor were a pain to walk up parking was ridiculous cost me for dsys at a nearby car park i would of been better staying at a travelodge all in all not a good experience
