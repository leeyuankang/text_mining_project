possibly the worst hotel we have stayed at in london we had to refuse the first room offered as it stank of smoke we did not have airconditioning as advertised the room was small and cramped and nothing like any of the photos on booking com or the hotel website i cannot see how it could be classed as a deluxe room which is what we requested and were charged for the shower was almost impossible to control in terms of temperature and the hot water was so scalding hot as to be dangerous our key needed replacing twice which was inconvenient as the lift was extremely slow there did not seem to be anyone of any seniority present and i am now about to email the manager as the compensation we were given in no way reflected the terrible experience we had the continental breakfast was extremely limited
