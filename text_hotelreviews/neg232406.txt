bed was uncomfortable with hard springs that you could feel all over the mattress room is tired and needs redecorating making it look very scruffy looked as though it hadn t been done up since the early s no mirror at the dressing table had to remove the mirror from the bathroom wall and lean it against the wall at the back of the dressing table so i could see myself while using the hairdryer mirror at the back was caked in dust behind it when i removed it so you can tell how long it had been since last cleaned properly or decorated
