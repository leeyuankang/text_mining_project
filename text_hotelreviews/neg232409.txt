i had booked a deluxe double room i did not receive a deluxe double room but a twin room i m very angry and upset as i physically had to move the two beds together and this did not help at all it created a gap in the middle my partner had come to visit me from a business trip and the whole night it was a nightmare when i informed the receptionist of the issue she said booking com you guys had put that order through i showed her my phone to show the booking said double bed but she said im sorry i can t do anything about it i m very disappointed both myself and my partner had a sleepless night in the morning when i woke up i noticed a mouse run from one side of the room to the other i m not a person to moan and kick up a fuss but this truly isn t fair i informed the receptionist about the issues in the morning very nicely and she apologised but what good is that i love the way your company works and hold it at great standards i was confused as to why she would blame booking com for the incorrect room we ve booked room s previously and have had no issues haz taher
