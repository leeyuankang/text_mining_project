the room was soo small i couldnt open my suitcase there was not heating in the room and the window was broken the isolation was very poor and you could hear guests from other rooms talking like they were next to you overall i would never stay in the hotel again the only postivie thing about the stay was the romanian girl which works there as a room service and she was the one helpfull one
