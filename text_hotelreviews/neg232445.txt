first room was cold the windows were old style but also actually old so some cold breeze was coming through so we had our room changed it wasn t cold anymore but the shower and the sink were terrible shower head was pretty much broken and it was difficult to have a proper shower very very weak water flow and the faucet of the sink was too short to even use it properly when washing my face i had to get some water in the sink and then wash instead of using water directly from the faucet other amenities were good enough though
