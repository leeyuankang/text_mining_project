the toilet was small and cold the room had no working heater besides i d ask for it before i went to london they have arranged one to fix the situation though it is not acceptable for london s winter weather to not have the rooms and the hotel warm at all times along winter the lack of natural light was another unpleasant detail the room s view was a wall the hotel pictures make it feel more lovely and cosy than it is
