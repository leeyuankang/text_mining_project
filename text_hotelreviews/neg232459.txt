rooms and the hotel are very old and in need in renovations you could hear everything that happened upstairs every step is audible and outside which was not great at night tv was great and big but it covered more than a half of the mirror the room is just too small for such tv so the only usable mirror was in the bathroom but as with most bathroom mirrors it was small there is no space around the sink so all your toiletries are on the other side of the bathroom the ventilation in the bathroom didn t work so it got pretty hot inside and there wasn t enough air hairdryer also didn t work there are not enough plugs even to charge two phones you have to unplug something from the wall or use usb from the tv which doesn t work if it is off out of lamps didn t work one in the bathroom and one bedside lamp we ve mentioned it to the receptionist right as we ve first got into the room but even on the day of our stay it wasn t fixed so hope next visitors could enjoy more light because the room is quite dark
