breakfast was very hit miss the dining room staff were very disorganised and didn t seem to know what they were doing we were ther for breakfasts and on each there was a problem mostly with running out of items and the clearing of tables the hotel was fairly busy the swing door to the kitchen was always open with diners viewing cleaning equipment etc i m glad i didn t order a cooked breakfast as this is ferried from the sister hotel across the road not good on at least occasions we had to wait for breakfast rolls and told they would be at least mins these also came from the sister hotel it s a shame as this dept lets the hotel down and needs to be looked at for improvement
