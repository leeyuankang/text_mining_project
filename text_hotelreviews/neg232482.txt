i was given a basement room although i asked the staff if this is the best they ve got for me a basement room was not mentioned during the booking on this website one staff member said there are no more rooms another staff member said they cant change my room since i used the washroom i found both excuses not logical since i was a first to report my displeasure before entering the room
