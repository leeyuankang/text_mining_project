see above breakfast dinner appeared to be brought from the hotel across the road the breakfast was carried uncovered the dinner was served in the hotel lobby as the dining room was not open although meals were served until when the meal was booked we were not told the dining room was closed the bar lobby only had two small tables some chairs very uncomfortable to sit at it felt like eating in a waiting room the experience was not helped by someone sitting at a side table with a take away the meals were not particularly good for a four star hotel it was very disappointing at first for breakfast we were seated at a table with extremely low chairs which made it very uncomfortable to reach the table we had to ask to be moved the room had seen better days the bathroom had cracked tiles one curtain tie back was wripped holding on to it s hook by tattered material again for the price it left something to be desired
