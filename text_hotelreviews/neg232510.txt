emne hotel rating good morning i visited london for a few days partly private and partly business stay we ended up booking one night through booking com after looking for stars hotel in the south kensington area this hotel was the gainsborough hotel queensberry place a hotel rated as a stars hotel by aa i am travelling a lot sometimes over traveling days per year i have never i staying in a star rated hotel with such old and low standard the staff was welcoming and helpful in every way but the standard of the hotel was definitely not anything near what one should expect when booking a stars hotel the standard of this hotel is what one could expect if booking a stars hotel the hotel was old and everything had a low and very worn out standard not even a european type socket for shaving machine in the newest and recently renovated bath room no heating air condition except for a small electric oven placed in a corner of the room one could switch on off manually oneself no heating in bathroom too cold to wanting to take a shower the guest areas of the hotel in general were as said old fashioned and very worn out from furniture toilets wallpaper etc etc to standard of dining room kitchen etc we were told we got a renovated room which was correct but the room standard was still extremely low if i was given an older room with an even older and worn out standard would i have not have been stayng there we fail to understand how aa as late as this year could rate this and similar type and standard hotel to more than stars to give this hotel a star rating is the same as misleading guests would almost say cheating guests who believe they have booked a stars almost top class hotel when hotels like hilton get stars is this hotel no more than a star hotel not even close to stars
