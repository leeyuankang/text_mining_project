from walking in the entrance the decor looked like it could do with a freshen up the lift was very small and noisy our room had a broken window pane the net curtain looked dirty the slash window would not close properly at the bottom and there was a huge air conditioning unit stuck on part of the window the curtains were off their tracks tea and coffee ok the beds were extremely hard and very uncomfortable the lift shaft was right next to our bedroom wall bathroom was tiny definitely no room to swing a cat continental breakfast was just about ok worried by the fact that the fruit juices and milk was out without any cover or chilling milk was warm the pastries were a bit stale condiments also open to the elements thought overall not value for money
