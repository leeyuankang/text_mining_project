staff was uncooperative and inexperienced their knowledge about london was poor i also ask on reception for adapter however receptionist said that i can leave self phone to her for charging next day i found out that they didn t charge it but they broke it in their opinion it wasn t their fault so they never payed repair but more importantly they never said sorry next four days i tried to speak with manager but she never showed up i even try to make appointment in couple of occasions it was broken because someone from staff tried to plug the phone too violently my phone was standard android phone and i gave them my own android charger probably they mixed up some of other incompatible charger with mine
