checked in and received a twin room instead of a double room the hotel did not have any double rooms lefts that night and the guy at the counter could only offer us free continental breakfasts the next day to make up for it we already had breakfast plans so no thanks plus he kept repeating it was also a superior room so it was the same sorry but its not it s like if i order a steak at a restaurant then get a fish sure they may be the same price but its not what i ordered not the best start to our vacation breakfast is fair for the price i guess for continental and for full but pretty boring just one type of ham and one type of cheese were offered plus some jams honey jogurt milk and cereals for the full breakfast there s a small menu with choice of eggs beans mushrooms etc but i d rather eat elsewhere there are tons of places nearby beds are short both rooms and the comforter those standard camel hotel felts was just sandwiched between sheets so the layers separated if you know what i mean the scratchy felt layer inevitably creeps onto your face at night oh also genius members are supposed to get welcome drinks but that didn t happen
