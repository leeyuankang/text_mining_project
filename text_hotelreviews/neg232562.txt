first room offered was in basement with no natural light second room had a window but only later realised the device in the middle of the floor with a vent pipe going across to the window was a fixture and meant to provide air conditioning it did cool the room but the noise was a health hazard impossible to hear ourselves speak so we cooked instead there was obviously one in the next room too noise was terrible room a bit shabby and could do with redecoration
