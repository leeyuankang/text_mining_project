staff could barely speak enough english to understand our requests ordered the wrong taxi for us which caused the driver problems without most electricity for one day gave us battery operated lamps but no price reduction breakfast was horrible not enough food and coffee was cold and order was wrong this was not the british hotel experience we expected when we chose this location would not recommend this to anyone
