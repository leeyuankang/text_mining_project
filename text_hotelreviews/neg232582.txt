the bed was very bad very narrow bed even though this room number is for a couple the width of the bed was barely cm the mattress sags in the middle then there is like a hole in the middle of the bed and we could not sleep well was created like a sank in the middle of the bed we wake up in the morning with back pain and muscle and very tired very bad experience and we will never come back there sorry but not recommended breakfast don t eat here by walking in the area you will find better options and cheaper
