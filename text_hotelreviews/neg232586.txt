upon arriving to the hotel for my fianc e birthday a concert at wembley the hotel for the night then afternoon tea at the ritz firstly the room was filthy there was rust all over the tap which looked like blood there was no cold water so he had to brush our teeth with hot water the shower basin filled up with water very quickly and i had to turn it off twice wait for the water to drain before switching it back on the headboard was loose the bed was really uncomfortable i never complain but i felt as if this room was totally not satisfactory and was the worst hotel experience of my life the paint from the celling was also falling down and the meagre window had filthy blinds
