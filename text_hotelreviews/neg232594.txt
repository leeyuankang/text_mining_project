when we went upstairs there was an indefinable smell our room was shabby and many things didn t work the water in the bathroom was a slow trickle we tried to open the blinds once up they would not come back down the cord was hung up on the top the lights in the bathroom didn t work and in the room itself they were little more than a feint glow the bed itself was very worn in and oddly comfortable which was the one plus the air conditioning was attached to the window in a strange tube structure that i ve never seen before and it fell out in the middle of the night
