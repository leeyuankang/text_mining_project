the double room was so small there was no room to store bags two people were unable to dress at the same time the walk in wet room was so small that when you turned on the shower it would completely soak the whole bathroom so no one else was able to use friends staying in a suit were meant to of received complimentary soft drinks fruit and dressing gowns which were not provided the gym smelt as if it was being used as a smoking room very disappointed in what appeared to be a lovely hotel with reasonable star rating
