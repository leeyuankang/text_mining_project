the rooms were somewhat disappointing in comparison to the facilities mentioned above in the double singles the mattresses were very uncomfortable larger and more pillows are needed with two people in the room there should be a second towel in the bathroom lastly instead of using a rigged very noisy air conditioning machine a standing quiet fan would do a better job to cool the room not being able to draw the drapes allowed too much light in to sleep
