the room was old fashioned with a huge ac unit stuck in the window my room was through a fire door and on its own at the top of some stairs which made me feel unsafe we asked if they could order a taxi for us as there was a storm we were told we should go out and find a taxi i also object to paying extra in case i use something in the hotel and then have to wait up to weeks to get it back
