tiniest room i have ever seen in my life had to climb over the bed to get from one side to the other couldn t close the bathroom door whilst on the toilet because it was too close to the wall and there was no room could step out of bed and reach the toilet in step really pleasant for a romantic break not big enough for a broom cupboard let alone humans
