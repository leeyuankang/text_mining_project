the shower in the first room we stayed in had no water pressure and you couldn t set it to a proper temperature in this way you could only choose to shower ice cold or boiling hot after telling the receptionist we were told that maintenance will take care of it while we were out sightseeing after returning the shower problem still hadn t been fixed and we were moved to another room which had a new shower but was located next to the noisy elevator oh well if it wasn t for the price we payed for this hotel definitely too much for what you get i would say it was all acceptable
