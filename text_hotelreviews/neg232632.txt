the room was in the basement so rather dark and looking up at the street where everyone walked past the cost on booking com for two nights was pounds without breakfast or pounds with breakfast i opted for the latter i e pounds for two breakfasts but they told me this only entitled me to the continental breakfast which cost only pounds i would thus have been better off only booking the room through booking com and paying for breakfast on arrival i pointed this out and they replied that i was getting a very reasonable room rate so should not complain
