booked a triple room for us and our old granddaughter only to find on arrival that all triple rooms were windowless i think that this should be stipulated on booking on checking with reception we were informed that all triple rooms were at the back of the biulding and were without windows we were offered a family room with a supplement of or a superior double room with childs camp bed we chose the latter not wanting to incur more cost we considereded we had already paid for a triple room to be enough we were particularly annoyed that our daughter was staying in a superior double room for so ineffect we paid fo a very small camp bed and what turned out to be a very cramped room the next morning we went to make a cup of tea and the long life milk pins were rancid they were out of date by months poor show and lack of housekeeping situation saved by the very pleasant staff working on the morning of sunday
