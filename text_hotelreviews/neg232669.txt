condition of the room no natural light in the room the room which was on the first floor right next to elevator shaft which wasn t too noisy thankfully was a bit of an odd layout the one thing you noticed as soon as you entered the room was that there was barely any natural light in the room as it only had a square window above a door where you d expect a window to be the door where the window should be was actually the entrance to the bathroom there was plenty of natural light there so the only option was to leave the bedroom door open the room was a triple as we d requested and although my bed was on the squidgy side they were fine and the linen was clean next to my sons bed there was a large patch of wallpaper missing where somebody had torn it away and the drawers next to my bed where broken with one drawer not shutting and the other had it s front broken off but just leaning against it tea making was fun as you had to plug it in on the floor after removing the tray from the beneath the tv i realise that this review seems negative it is sad as it wouldn t take much effort to make it a really nice hotel but i find it surprising that it s rated as a star due to all the issues i found i can t comment on the food as we ate breakfast and all other meals out in kensington we still had a successful trip as we only spent our sleeping hours there sad to say but i wouldn t stay at the gainsborough again
