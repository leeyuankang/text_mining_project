hotel lobby is tired looking as was entrance area to my room very small room indeed advertised as a double but really it is a single shower unit too small and i am petite a larger person certainly couldn t shower in it side table lamp not working nor was the safe room carpet had stains on as did the over cover on the bed building work noises constantly from the next building starting early ending late room backs onto a busy school playground if you do want to use this room ask for a big discount as it s certainly not worth anywhere near what they are charging good location or not
