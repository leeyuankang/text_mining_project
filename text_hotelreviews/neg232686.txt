public areas were very nice but room we were allocated was very disappointing for a romantic weekend decor and furnishings seemed very dated and was more like a single room than a double bed was two singles pushed together and only one bedside cabinet buffet breakfast area at am on a sunday was poorly stocked and seating inadequate dining chairs are far too cumbersome with tables used should consider bistro seating staff were pleasant and there seemed to be a lot of them perhaps maybe coordination regard seating of guests and restocking of buffet table should be addressed we had to wait for coffee milk juice and had no pastries
