i once stayed at this hotel back to years ago for some reason i got a good memo thus checked in the hotel again with my husband as first stop of our honeymoon yet i didn t get any impressions this time wifi signal is bad and i am surprised to find that there is no chinese option in tv language menu and that is a page menu breakfast is plain i checked in at weekend for nights when asked the lady in reception for breakfast time she told me as so the third day morning when i got to the breakfast area by the breakfast got closed already and when i asked another hotel staff she said yes for weekend we open until but for weekdays as and she only said sorry without any other actions of course i didn t argue either but just left given i paid over per night the price didn t justify the qualify either not recommend on the basis
