they gave me room it is behind a firedoor and cut off from the rest of the hotel and therefore the hotel heating does not affect this room there is a heater in the room it was not working and the room was freezing cold i complained someone came up to look at it then said that they d have to call maintenance in the morning no offer to exchange the room etc next morning the shower took min to warm up and was a trickle at best this time they offered that i shower in a different room by this time all i wanted to do was to get out of the musty freezing room at the reception there was no apology they charged me gbp for a night in a small cold room even at this bargain price it was not worth it i could have been a frequent traveller with them and could have recommended this hotel to others at work who stay in london nights every single week i will never stay there again
