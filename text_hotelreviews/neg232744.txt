for single travellers this is more like a two star definitely not a four and a bad two star at that on checking in i could barely understand the person at the check in desk for some reason she insisted on rubbing it in i was not going to be charged for an early check in which i had not asked for anyway i was expecting to use the luggage storage facility which by the way is just the area in the general vicinity of the check in desk she also assumed i was going to use room service and wanted me to pre pay a charge had to say no on more than one occasion i was in a single room on floor this was actually through door listed as stairs to reception no mention of my room number and basically looks like it was just a spare bit of space they had on a landing had no wardrobe space as filled with large floor fan and a luggage support no room to put these in room anyway shelf was filled with a safe no drawers at all had to sit on bed to open bathroom door as no space to walk by window was broken with a temporary repair that had been there for a while shower was disgusting with a rusting shower head mould round the bottom and the tiles had heavy lime scale water marks all over suggesting not cleaned properly in a long long time shower doors very stiff and did not like to force them closed suggesting that no one else wanted to use it either i counted two light switches in the bathroom one above the door and one for the wall mounted hair dryer are these even legal dust on bottom edge of wardrobe at the side some one could not be bothered to reach down the side of the wall to remove it bed cover was actually a double folded in half and valance ripped albeit on the wall side limited tea coffee and only two milk and cup provided was very small giving you a very strong coffee with not enough milk to make drinkable the television was plugged into a multi socket extension which was hanging in mid air
