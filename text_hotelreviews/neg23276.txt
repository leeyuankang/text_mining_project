got to the hotel and they requested a security deposit of which i wasn t aware of wasn t advertised at time of booking i had already paid the room fee in full so the long conversation with the manager and numerous phone calls was just all so unessercary in my opinion after about an hour they said your free to go to the room as you re not paying a security deposit you are banned from the hotel bar and restaurant crazy never again no mirror in my room either which sucked for the price it was terrible avoid
