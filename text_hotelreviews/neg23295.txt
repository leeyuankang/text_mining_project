this seems fairly standard in hotels but the disabled room had a bath rather than a walk in shower although the bath was low and had grab rails my wife cannot use baths and had to stand in it to take a shower and there are no grab rails provided for that activity consequently i had to support her whilst she washed some hotels provide a shower seat so she can sit down whilst washing in these circumstances the transfer in and out of a bath is extremely hazardous for someone with mobility problems especially when the floor is wet
