after too much travel delays instead of getting in the hotel at we arrived at am unfortunately for us we are extremely tired and the receptionist on duty was taking his sweet time checking us in and trying to print the parking instruction he was unsympathetic but the following i was ready to argue with anybody who will give a bad service but everybody were professional friendly and efficient so to sum it up it was a brilliant stay
