it s not really a dislike but more a warning i booked single beds because i was traveling with my teenage daughter they were in fact single beds but up one against the other this happens often in european rooms in this case there was really no way to distance the beds it was fine for us but i thought i d mention it in case someone is traveling with a person that they don t necessary want to have so close it may be different in other rooms
