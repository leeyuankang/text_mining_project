our room had no working air conditioning you could tell as soon as you walked in the room after telling the bellhop and subsequent calls to the front desk the manager trolls up an hour later with a portable air conditioner and apologises that the hotel is full and this the best they can do his attempted humour stating you re lucky it wasn t last week with the hotter weather let s just say that went down a treat buddy the so called portable air conditioning unit stood nearly metres high and a metre wide i asked where does the hot air get expelled he said that it s all contained in the unit upon further inspection it s a dehumidifier that you have to pour water into the unit blew out old cigarette smells and as far as the decibel volume wow i was then offered another excuse that the whole floor was out liar seems the air conditioning was working perfectly in the hallway now i know things go wrong and apologies aside they offered us nothing in compensation for the problem no room discount no drink no food no zip we even requested a later checkout and had to wait until morning for it to be approved another problem to watch out for is the toilet in the bathroom it s raised on a step that juts out further than the toilet seat edge nearly broke my toe early in the morning as far as the location of the hotel take it or leave it didn t float our boat mind you the negronis we got in the alley down the road cost us one drink was enough
