skip breakfast which is like a scene out of fawlty towers the second day after waiting for an hour to receive our cooked breakfast we just got up and left the table behind us had similar problems and received the wrong order three times and it was still wrong other tables seem to be experiencing similar problems it is a pity that this experience clouds the wonderful warm welcome we received the bar is expensive before they add on service charge
