several years ago i used to stay at st james on business sole occupancy but had forgotten the rooms where so small and for two persons room was rather akin to a cabin on one of the better cruise liners for example there was no room to pass between the bed and someone sitting at the dressing table the bathrooms are little more than a closet and in our case the shower head sprayed water outside the bath and flooded the floor moreover i am in my s and find showers situated in baths problematical comfort was therefore sadly lacking and not conducive to a relaxed stay which one would anticipate in an high end expensive hotel
