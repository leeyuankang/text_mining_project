room executive too small windows to the yard not designed to open so no fresh air only aircon noisy quirking floor in spite of perfect bed the claustrofobic framework and the noise issues as well as lack of proper curtains to keep out the morning sun light and a gap between door and floor allowing bright light to enter from the hall way the room was never really dark and never really tranquil so although the room would look great on a photo i truely hated it
