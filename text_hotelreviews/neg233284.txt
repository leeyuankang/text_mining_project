they added an extra service charge to the bill at check out which was not within the terms at the time of booking they explained that it was for the maids i suspect they don t pay their maids very well and have to ask guests to contribute i wonder whether they will add another for the bell staff for the front desk of maintenance staff and so on then the hotel wont need to pay any wages the room was not very soundproof i could hear noise in the corridor all day and night
