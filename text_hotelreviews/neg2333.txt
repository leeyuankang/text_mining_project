we arrived in the early hours to check in after paying a taxi to take us to front door we were asked to walk to their sister hotel down the street where they then tried to check us in again and charge us again then headed down to our room where the key card didn t work so headed back to reception they then came down with us and it still didn t work so told us to wait at the room they then returned and manually opened our door and said it couldn t be fixed until the next day it then soon dawned on us that we wouldn t be able to go for breakfast as we wouldn t be able to get back in our room the bed clearly hadn t been changed as there were other peoples hairs in the sheets and pillows my bedside table also had what i can only describe as orange zest all over it this was at am so we decided to grin and bare as we were shattered then the morning came our wake up call of a fire alarm at wasn t exactly pleasant followed by the cleaners ringing the door bell several times and getting us out of bed even though we had until to check out we left and couldn t get out fast enough after a very bad experience we found ourselves on a street we hadn t planned to be on with no idea which way to head hopefully we wont stumble across this hotel again it really was a shame as it looked as if the place was actually run by someone who cares it could have been lovely but at the tune of for less than hours we wont ever be going back
