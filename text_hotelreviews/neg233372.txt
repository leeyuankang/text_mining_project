we stayed here a couple of times already and both times we had room service stumbling into the room almost without knocking early in the morning regardless of the fact it was weekend and we were in bed sleeping make sure you use the do not disturb sign if you don t want to find yourself trying to make the room service leave which surprisingly often does not work from the first attempt half naked
