very very minor problems it was a little pricey but it is central london and we did get a more deluxe room than we normally would and the staff were delightful so it didn t feel too expensive given what we got views of the city from the floor given its location were unsurprisingly just close ups of other tall city buildings but there was a nice balcony area as part of the room and it still feels quite cool to be high up on downtown london
