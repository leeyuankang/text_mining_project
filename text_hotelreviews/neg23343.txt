i don t stay in hotels often and i organised the stay for of us rooms and i was not expecting the amount of details required when we checked in and it took a long time we were all booked in separately and amongst much confusion as some of the receptionists were just checking us in and some were insisting on knowing who was in which room and cross checking our list against who had already checked in at one of the other desks also our luggage seemed to get muddled up when we left it behind reception again it took a long time to sort it out the only other thing that affected us was the lifts i think one was out of order and it made it difficult to get down to breakfast as the hotel was apparently busier than usual some of our party tried to walk down the stairs but couldn t find a way all the way to the ground floor
