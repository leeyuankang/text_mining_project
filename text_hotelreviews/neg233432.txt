this is the time we have stayed at this hotel and we were extremely disappointed with the size of the room we were given more like a cupboard only about inches of room between the bed and the wall each side we did complain but we were told it was full also at breakfast they tend to bring everything to the table at the same time for example we were eating our cereal and they brought the cooked breakfast which we sent back but instead of re doing the breakfast they kept it warm which meant the eggs went hard
