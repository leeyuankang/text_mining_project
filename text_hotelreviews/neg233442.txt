i ordered quite a bit of room service and the food really wasn t very good steak was overdone no sauce all i could do is choose ketchup with chips which were oily i was disappointed to be honest for the price i expected better quality also the room was not very bright the lighting was very dim at night while i was trying to do paper work the room was not very bright
