having travelled to other apex hotels we found the breakfast to be extremely expensive previously we have paid a set price which included all continental breakfast items and then we paid a small extra charge to have a cooked breakfast we were most disappointed to find that even though we ordered a cooked breakfast that in fact nothing else not even drinks were included i would have thought that all apex hotels should be the same
