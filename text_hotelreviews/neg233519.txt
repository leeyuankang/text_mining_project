i didn t know if id have time for a breakfast on each of the mornings i stayed at the hotel i was informed at check in that id have to say there and then if i wanted a breakfast for each of the mornings i couldn t just drop down on day for a breakfast and have that charged to my room as it happened i didn t have time for a breakfast on any of the mornings anyway so it didn t matter but i just felt it was a little less accommodating that i have experienced elsewhere however this didn t take from my stay and i would stay again if traveling to london
