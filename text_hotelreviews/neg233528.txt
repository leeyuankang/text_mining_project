everything was perfect apart from one thing which was a bit disappointing i had booked the hotel and couple months in advanced for my boyfriends birthday and had paid extra for petals and a vanilla birthday cake in the room i was asked a check in time so the cake would be fresh and they were very accommodating to be make it special however when we arrived at the time requested there was neither the cake or petals in the room so the surprise was ruined i explained to reception and they said i should of been specific with the time they then apologised and refunded the petals and brought the cake straight away which was chocolate which my boyfriend isn t a great fan of but was still nice that they brought it so fast overall we had a lovely stay but this did let it down for me a bit as i had planned it for a surprise but my boyfriend still had a lovely birthday which is what mattered
