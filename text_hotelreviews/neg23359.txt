seemingly if you re middle aged you get seated before a young couple at breakfast regardless of the list made we were made to wait mins for a table whilst others jumped ahead somehow then when my partner alerted the woman in charge of said seating she said ok and walked straight to a couple next to us who d just arrived absolutely ridiculous hopefully a single incident and not common place
