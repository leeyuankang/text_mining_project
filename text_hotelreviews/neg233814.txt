no hot water for days so i couldn t take a shower i complained times and was told to wait minutes or so whilst the boiler was being reset over hour i waited on saturday morning and still no hot water so we decided to go without a shower and actually go out sunday morning was exactly the same to make things worse the receptionist said that this happens a lot and it was down to the guests taking showers all at the same time it a blooming hotel and not a youth hostel and at for nights i expect to have running hot water seriously annoyed and have logged a complaint with best western to get this resolved
