the lift had no interior light and a faulty door at reception level used once with the assistance of the receptionist but my wife was terrified and we used the stairs for the rest of our stay as even replacing the light was beyond them i can t imagine what a standard room is like as our executive double was so small that it was very difficult to move around the standard double bed over of the floor tiles in the small bathroom were cracked and the wash basin tiny the bed head furniture was broken the carpet was threadbare in many places including a ragged edge at the doorway what was described as a desk barely qualified to be called a shelf facilities quoted such as i pad dock sky tv etc did not exist given that we were staying a few days after the grenfell tower i had concerns about the fire safety of the hotel which has only a single staircase from the only access at street level to the fourth floor i very much regret not giving sufficient credence to the many poor tripadvisor reviews
