we had no hot water for washing or showering during the whole stay nights informed the reception on several occasions they were apologetic and reset the boiler more than once but this made no difference the female on reception said she had only known this problem once but looking at the past reviews this problem has been on going in certain rooms since march have emailed the hotel and understand that my letter has been passed onto the management team but had no reply yet i have a provisional room booked in october but will keep it like that until i get a suitable reply would also like the front door secured at night as any one can walk in off the street and head towards the rooms without any questioning as the reception is on the first floor
