the bathroom was a disgrace neither my partner nor myself dared to have a shower as it looked really unclean the base of the shower was badly chipped in numerous places and the grouting was filthy the sink tap was also very grubby whilst the room was a special deal i do expect a decent sized room you could hardly move around the bed the fabric on the wall lights above the bed was coming apart and looked dirty the bed was uncomfortable and the mattress had seen better days
