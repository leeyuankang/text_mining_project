for the last two days we have had no shower as there was no hot water room we complained and they said it would get fixed the same day it was not also the lift got jammed on our floor so we needed to go up to the next floor and walk down to our floor with our heavy suitcases we are pensioners and it was very difficult i think we are intitled to a refund especially as we had no hot water this was a real case of not caring nobody cared less and this was supposed to be a best western hotel very very unprofessional
