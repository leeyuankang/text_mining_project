the bed was extremely uncomfortable honestly the worst nights sleep i ve ever had in a hotel with it being a rated hotel i expected a lot better for the price we paid the shower was very grubby and there was no hot water on the sunday night all in all i wouldn t return to this hotel although it s in a great location
