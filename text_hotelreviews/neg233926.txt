i booked a double deluxe room was on the floor lots of stairs to climb nice sized room however went to use the bathroom and the toilet was full of someone elses urine as i went to flush it was clear that the mechanism was broken and someone had attempted to poorly cover up the damange as it fell back into the wall never to be seen again i called down to reception and the gent very quickly changed me to another room however this room was much smaller so small i couldn t swing a cat and no discount was offered as i was travelling on business i was carrying some important documentation went to pop it into the safe to find that it was locked the idiot before me had clearly not left it as instructed so the poor receptionist had to come up again to unlock it for me but again he did this quickly and apologetically from here the theme just continued both sink and shower refused to drain and when i eventually got them going it was at a snails pace and the shower doors were hanging off the runners and almost impossible to open close the room was utterly freezing and duvet was far too thin for winter without extra blankets provided etc went downstairs for some drinks with a friend to be met with a bar that had no tonic no ice no suitable glasses etc for the gin and tonic that i required warm gin and lemonade in a brandy glass is what i ended up with i dread to think how the cocktails were produced the highlight for me however was the little guest in the bathroom mr cockroach i took great pleasure in deliberately ending his life in the white shower mat so that the staff had evidence of his existence in the morning while checking out i listed all of the above to the receptionist who like a darling gave me the drinks that i had had in the bar or so free of charge as an apology as mentioned staff were exceptional but let down greatly by the disrepair of their building
