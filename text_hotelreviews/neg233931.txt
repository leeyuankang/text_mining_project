we selected a hotel with parking because we were travelling with a car by this we understood thwre would be a secured parking at no extra cost when we arrived the hotel was difficult to find locatef on rhe main road difficult to stop and unload and it transpired that there was no car park i will not use booking com again as i feel we were mislead on this point and it caused us extra stress and cost on top of this it appeared that the hotel was a best western it was not clearly advertised these hotels are notorious for poor breakfast service and sadly the seraphine lived up to its reputation if you want a cooked breakfast don t forget to order the day before the receptionist will not mention this finally although the room was clean and we ll provided with tv and tea making facilities i m convinced i heard mice squeaking near my bed if the receptionist had bothered to ask me i would have told him but he didn t so i m telling the anyone who wants to hear it
