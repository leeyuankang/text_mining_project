the single rooms are very small so if you suffer from claustrophobia think again about booking this type of room luckily the room did have a large window so it didn t feel like a box security in the hotel was lacking in my view as anyone can walk off the street and walk up the stairs to any hotel room plus when my room was cleaned the door to my room was not shut properly and anyone could have walked in and taken any of my personal possessions when i complained to reception all they did was say sorry and that it won t happen again you have been warned
