the two stories of stairs that you need to climb before you reach a very narrow reception area the lift that goes up from reception has no oxygen flow and moves at a pace slower than u can walk the rooms are extremely small and have no fridge facilities it s basically like staying in a shoe box perfect for one level up from a backpackers place but never if you want to enoy your stay or if you are travelling with children only good thing i have to say is that the staff were very helpful and welcoming
