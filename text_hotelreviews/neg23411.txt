the staff did not feel very relaxed and welcoming and they would immediately try to sell you an upgraded room on top of that i did not receive an invoice even if i had been promised to receive it by email however when i looked on my credit card statement there was an additional unauthorised charge of on top of my room charge although i did not use any additional hotel services i have sent a complaint but have not received a response so far
