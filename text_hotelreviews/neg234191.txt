personally we were lucky and everything was wonderful here are few bits we didn t like but i loved the hotel anyways the area doesn t feel very nice and the metro line was sketchy it s still close to the center min metro or walk and generally ok and safe just not a pleasant one in order to get an iron board you have to pick it downstairs and put it back yourself too thankfully there s an elevator tv only in french also i ve seen some people got rooms that facing backyard so it s very dark and everyone could see what s going in their bathroom i definitely wouldn t prefer these rooms
