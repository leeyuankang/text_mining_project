we initially booked a superior double room which was incredibly small smelt of stale cigarettes and only had towels for one person unfortunately there wasn t another room available until the next morning so we had to put up with it for one night and then pay for an upgrade to an executive suite frustrating given how much we d already paid but given the room was airy and more than twice the size well worth doing the self service bar in the reception area is a good idea but i d recommend bringing the pricing down as i suspect more people would then use it
