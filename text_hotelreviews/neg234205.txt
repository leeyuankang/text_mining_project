the property was a little far out however the metro systems are brilliant once you can work them out we felt like geniuses once we had conquered how to use them was a little off putting the hotel down a side street but it does feel like you re in another world once you re in there we were lucky enough to get a room with a balcony and if you can request one do beautiful views of paris rooftops amazing hotel i d say a little over priced for how far out you are but over all i really enjoyed my stay and would definitely return should we go back to paris
