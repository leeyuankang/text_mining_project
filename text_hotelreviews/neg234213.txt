on the first night we arrived we were locked out of the room for an hour and the young night shift receptionist was not helpful at all swearing in between trying to open the door repeatedly we weren t given anything complimentary to make up for the massive inconvenience we had to ask for small bottles of water for example and he responded rudely and nonchalantly we eventually went to another room but all of our belongings were in the previous room we understand that these are one offs but it was new year s eve and we just wanted to get a good night s sleep water could have been hotter too in the rooms this really puts off guests to have warm water apart from that our stay was amazing and we really loved the service from all the other staff who were on hand to make it special for us
