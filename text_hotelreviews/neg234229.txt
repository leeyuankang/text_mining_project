nicholas needs to learn more about customer service and not treat guests like disposable garbage all he cared about was making more money on a room rather than customer satisfaction i extended but it wasn t input the system to my surprise i was called and asked my checkout time when i went to discuss the issue they wanted to increase the price of the room and all he kept telling me is how much money he cant get for the room if i left disgusted i was there over a week but that held no value he obviously lacked people skills and needs to learn the value of hotel service and know reputation is what builds a hotel name
