not sure how this place has such high reviews room very small i booked this hotel because they said there were twin beds available so that s what i requested when i checked in they said they didn t have any staff was absent for long periods of time downstairs and when i got back after midnight one night i was locked out of the hotel for about ten minutes until the only staff member on duty actually decided to check the ground floor
