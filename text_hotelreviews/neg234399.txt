we didn t really use any of the facilities within the hotel such as the gym and business centre or wifi so can t advise how good or bad they were the duvet cover on our extra child bed was not ironed and the tv in the room didn t work however as we were not in the room for long to watch tv it wasn t a huge problem for us
