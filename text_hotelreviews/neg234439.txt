room felt tired the room service was a disaster you book through an external site that accesses many local restaurants after ordering dinner i got a call to say they could not fulfil my order and suggesting i start again there is no real check in it is diy so they don t tell you but only one of the lifts gets you to the restaurant and gym you have to work that out yourself but there is only one lift button so the same wrong lift kept coming back and i basically had to wait for someone else to get in that one for the right one to come to my floor it is almost laughable how bad that is and as for the business lounge well that is the entrance hall with a few seats in it nice idea but poor implementation
