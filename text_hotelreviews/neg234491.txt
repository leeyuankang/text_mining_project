room and bed sizes could have been better we had a one double room and one family room in the family room for three people s stay the sofa bed was made even before we entered the room which could be great if someone check in at night but not middle of the day giving room a dormitory like look than a nice hotel room it would been really great if either the house keeping could have helped making the bed for third person later and left the the sofa as is when we enter the room
