at the weekend most of the nearby shops are closed including the coffee places there is a good one directly opposite where you might have breakfast instead of in the hotel where it is served in the goucho resturant under the hotel and street level there are newspapers and fruit supplied in reception near the tea and coffee machines but these are not available at the weekend if like me you need something in your stomach before heading out there is a sainsburys local on the next corner open every day
