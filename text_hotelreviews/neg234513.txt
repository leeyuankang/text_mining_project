reservation was confirmed by booking com so we assumed all was good when we arrived booking had been cancelled because they had been unable to take test payment from our card registered with booking com which worked perfectly on the night of our arrival however they had not informed us directly or via booking com as it happened they still had a room and honoured the booked price so all was good but would advise directly confirming your booking especially at busier times of year
