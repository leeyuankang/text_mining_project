breakfast which is not included staff not friendly and the hotel has cut back from years ago on what it offers is it too much to ask that hot drinks are brought to the table you have to collect your own hot drinks no teapots and nowhere to put used teabags except on clean saucers which appeared to exasperate the waiter so provide a bin hot water for tea in flask on buffet table but not nearly hot enough coffee flask not labelled so i assumed it was hot water dirtied a cup which also ppeared to exasperate the waiter quality of the food is fine however the experience is not for anyone visiting club quarters in gracechurch street i suggest you nip over the road into leadenhall market and get breakfast in a cafe there or room service if you must
