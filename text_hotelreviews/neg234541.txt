not long after we arrived we asked for a couple of extra pillows to be brought to our room later in the afternoon not realsing there were glasses in the bathroom we asked for two to be brought to our room later that evening we asked for knives and forks as there were none in our room the person who answered our call seemed annoyed that we were asking and suggested we ask for everything we wanted at once to save time being made to feel that we were a nuisance by calling guest services put a dampener on what would otherwise have been a very enjoyable stay the rest of the staff were all pleasant helpful and friendly
