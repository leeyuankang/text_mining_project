the reception staff and gaucho restaurant staff were really poor terrible attitude we arrived early and even though i notified the hotel of this fact months in advance the receptionist looked at me as if i was crazy when i asked for an early check in she actually said absolutely not sir check in is at and we were fully booked last night the waiter during breakfast in gaucho restaurant was also incredibly unfriendly we ordered eggs benedict and he said with this you get free juice and fruit but nothing else almost protecting the few croissants that was laid out on the excuse for a buffet table we are paying goood money to stay at your hotel and you have a waiter who is protecting your croissants not that i wanted one but i thought this was ridiculous if you want some free advice send your staff on a customer service course they work in hospitality and they are extremely inhospitable
