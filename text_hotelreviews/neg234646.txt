it did get a little noisy at night later in the week from voices carrying outside especially towards the weekend which was surprising since the whole area is pretty empty after on weekdays and pretty empty the whole time on the weekend a bit like how wall street gets in new york also it was pretty hot at night if you don t ask them to keep the air conditioning on they turn it off every night in your room
