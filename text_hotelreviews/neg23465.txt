my sister had a disappointing experience with one of the receptionist when she asked assistance to mail out a postcard the receptionist abruptly told her they can t and don t do that service and advised my sister to proceed to the station across the hotel it was already at that time when my sister mentioned that from her experiences in her multiple stay at pullman hotel in hong kong her request to mail out letter and even packages were accepted with courtesy and she always pay for the postage fee the manager gentleman who was passing through at that moment heard my sister s comment and he quickly took the postcard and very nicely offered to mail it for her without charge now that s the kind of courtesy service we expect from a pullman hotel the lady receptionist should attend more seminars to correct her poor manners the beds were a bit too soft
