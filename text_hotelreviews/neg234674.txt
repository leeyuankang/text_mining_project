there needs to be a clearer arrangement between booking com and the hotel on breakfast we booked breakfast with our booking paying for a full english breakfast but found that there was not a full english breakfast on offer for this amount there is also a lack of flexibility in the breakfast offering this is not a comment on the quality of the food which is good but the the lack of clarity on booking
