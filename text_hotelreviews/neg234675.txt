our room had a window but opposite to that was a wall so no sunlight or view the room had a slight odour like someone had smoked in there tho location was pretty central in the city of london but the nicer eestaurants etc are somewhere else maybe better suited for business trips at the check out it turned out that the hotel restaurant tried to charge us something we didn t order that got sorted out after a while then my card didn t work the first time the receptionist tried it and he started asking if we had enough money the situation was pretty awkward the third time the card worked fine who knows what the proplem was all in all i wouldn t recommend this hotel you can find better for this money
