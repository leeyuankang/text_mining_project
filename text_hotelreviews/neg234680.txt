this does not feel like checking into a normal hotel no customer service what so ever barely acknowledged that i was a customer standing in front of them at check in i asked to have extra pillows delivered to my room and they told me to collect them in a guest closet myself on the floor i was staying on there was nothing in the guest closet except iron so that wasn t very helpful
