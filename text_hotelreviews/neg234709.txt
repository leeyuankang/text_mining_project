the lighting in the room was not practical one switch turned on all of the lights in the room so when i went to bed my husband and son had to sit in the dark in the separate living area otherwise i would have a bright light above my bed if they switched the lights on nothing luxurious about the furnishing or fittings in the room bathroom but simple functional and clean because it is in the business district most nearby shops are shut on the weekends but comes back to life on weekdays
