when we arrived we got greeted and asked for a card to take just in case they needed it so my partner gave them his debit card they said we won t take any money from this it s just a incase anything happens so he gave his card and we went to our room we went out later that even for dinner and the card was declined they had taken the out of the account this wasn t a card we were going to pay with for the hotel and now didn t have any money for the weekend we went to reception and told them that the money had been taken and this wasn t on they told us there was nothing they could do about it accept try and put the money back on the card they told us it would take days to go back on i paid for the hotel days later with my card as we were leaving but my partners card still didn t have the money back on it week after we had stayed there with lots of phoning and chasing the money was back on the card this was extremely bad customer service and not on
