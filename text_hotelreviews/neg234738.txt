bed was a bit too hard for me but not everyone likes a soft bed and at check in the procedure wasn t explained very well felt like it was left up to ourselfs no explanation of where room was or that the card was needed to go up the lift we got most of the info we needed from the welcome card in room we did get early check in for free as our room was ready so that was good and staff did seem very helpful when needed anything
