i found the service appalling i had firstly called your hotel on friday may to advise i would be using another card to pay for my stay than the one i had originally booked with i had asked could i just charge the original card or would i need to have it with me the man i spoke with advised i would need it with me and he would have to send me an application of authorization i never received the email secondly on my way to the hotel i had called to advise what the situation would be and that i would be using a new card instead the lady on the phone advised me i could not check into my room until when making my booking on booking com it specifically asked me what time i would like to check in i selected box this was another stress that was not necessary and the lady still could not guarantee my room would be ready this should not be advertised to customers if their rooms are not available until thankfully there was a room available when we arrived on checking in there was no explanation that my card was going to be charged an extra pounds for a security for breakfast etc i checked my bank account today and had to call the hotel to ask what this extra charge was for none of this was explained on arrival we were not even given times of breakfast or told anything about the amenities in the hotel at exactly on sunday may checkout our telephone rang in our room reception presumably mins later a man knocked on our room door as i answered he he was asking am i staying an extra night or checking out i found this absolutely outrageous that within minutes of being late out of room i had telephone call and a knock on my door i was at reception to checkout by it was harassment i will never return to this hotel i was absolutely disgusted with how guests are given no information about anything and the lack of interest your staff show towards the customers
