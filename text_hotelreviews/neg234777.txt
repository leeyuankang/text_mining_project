not friendly staff we were staying with friends for a weekend no room service after and no bar in the hotel so if you want a drink you have no options and staff is not helpful at all we asked where can we go in the area but the man in reception just told us that he doesnt know anything not interested in helping at all maybe good for business quests but not for leisure just because of the location room was old and soulless needed some good dusting
