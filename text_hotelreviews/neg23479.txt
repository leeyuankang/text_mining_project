very rigid reservation policy some staff are welcoming but some are very arrogant i changed travel plan and requested to change my reservation to the next day but was denied well that s ok then i planned to booked one more day i asked them if these separate bookings can be combined to a consecutive one but was denied again the result is that i spent more money but got much less value no breakfast room in lower floor facing the bustling street even no drinking water for the day i booked totally nights in a consecutive one when i arrived london the above story happened in the rest booking really contrasting when i m confused about no drinking water the lady answered arrogantly with serious looking because you booked a standard room but i will give the water only this time the fact is that my room is not a standard one and no one came to restore the water
