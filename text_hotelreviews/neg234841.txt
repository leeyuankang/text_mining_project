breakfast not included in price hotel doesn t have a bar although there is a weatherspoons next door gaucho is closed on sunday although i appreciate the city is quiet on a weekend the rooms themselves are ok particularly for the price we paid but if we d paid the rack rate i d have been a tad disappointed as our room was a bit tired and the bed was small not that comfy
