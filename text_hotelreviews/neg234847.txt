the put up third bed was not as comfortable as the main bed but it was okay the hotel was basically an up market travel lodge with self catering aimed squarely at the traveling business world so the staff were great and helped you use the self check in good wifi and if you ever need to hold a meeting there is a place to do that with free coffee and smarties close to hand
