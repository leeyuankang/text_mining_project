the room was very small as was the bathroom the sink in the bathroom was tiny and very low making it difficult to use there was no shelf in the bathroom and therefore nowhere to put toiletries the room did not have temperature control or air conditioning and was a bit too hot there was a ceiling fan although we were asked to turn it off because the people in the room above complained about the noise hotel was nice but a little overpriced costing me for nights i think per night would have been more reasonable
