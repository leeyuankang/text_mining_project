the shower over a bath wasn t cleaned well at all and there was lots of hair over the shower walls and bits of dirt on the walls that all came off with the shower head showering over them so the cleaner obviously hadn t bothered to clean the walls there was also a clump of girls long hair in between the pillows though the bed did appear to have been freshly made we googled exactly what star actually meant after being disappointed with what we were expecting versus what we got we asked for a complimentary late checkout when we arrived and were offered instead of and advised our booking would be updated so we wouldn t be called before we received two phone calls before the first at to tell us checkout was at so we explained we were given a checkout and then a second call at to let us know checkout was at pretty frustrating
