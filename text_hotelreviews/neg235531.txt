we were told to walk to the next hotel which we hadn t booked the room they showed me had a dirty toilet used and not flushed the next room was enormous and clean the bed was a pull down one from the wall no bedside cabinets or electric plugs tea making facilities good but there was no plug for the kettle nearby the staff asked when we left had we enjoyed our stay we said no they said had we enjoyed breakfast we hadn t had it they told us that the receptionist when we booked in had offered us a complimentary breakfast we were not told of this we voiced our dissatisfaction the manager did write to us but the outcome of her review has not been forwarded to us altogether a poor experience
