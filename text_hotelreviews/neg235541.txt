first room we were allocated we found water pouring from the ceiling light fittings having been relocated the room lacked air conditioning a fridge adequate power points or hot water pressure shower for this day and age a modern television with more than five channels should be considered the norm our four poster bed had not been cleaned properly and both the room and bathroom appeared generally tired for one night should command higher standards very disappointing we would not recommend or return
