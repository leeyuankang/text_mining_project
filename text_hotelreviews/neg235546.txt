room on first night had no shelf or space for toiletry items in the bathroom more annoying than it sounds the wifi didn t work second night upgraded to room with normal bathroom shelf space and good working wifi pompous drapes around the bedhead full of dust which rained down every time we moved some sort of fan or other machinery droning all night long nearby with no obvious way of switching off water pump in loft space ran loud whenever someone used water restaurant basic and unimaginative shame as the garden setting is very nice
