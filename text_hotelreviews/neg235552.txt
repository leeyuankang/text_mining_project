at midnight i decided i wanted a snack i ask for two items marked as available hours by an asterisk a parisienne sandwich and vegetable samosas the concierge told me vegetable samosas aren t available at this hour i mentioned that it was marked as available he replied but i ll need to turn on the oven if you really need the samosas i guess i can do that stressing the point if i really need it and indicating his preference to not bother with more than he needs to do i replied no that s fine i don t need it just bring me the sandwich when he finally arrived with the sandwich he set down the tray and doing so knocked out the tv s box he apologized and proceeded to tell me things weren t going well for him i told him not to worry about it and i m sorry to hear things weren t going well of note some of the other staff were friendly and would treat me with a smile other staff gave me strange looks with neither a greeting nor the semblance of a warm welcome i pride myself on being a warm kind generous person so to be met by such expressions by the staff was a bit disconcerting and unexpected not sure it was worth the price but then little in london is
