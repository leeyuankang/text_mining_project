there was an extremely loud droning noise in our room which was on and off from about we are assuming it was something to do with the water system as the guests started showering in the morning ruined a sunday morning lie in the shower door was broken and if you moved the shower head higher so that you could wash your hair the shower turned off there was no breakfast team available in the room the room was also stifling hot when we arrived i appreciate it is cold out and guests like different temperatures but we turned the radiator off and needed the fan on all night i can only assume our room was adjacent to a boiler when mentioned to the member of staff on reception as we checked out she seemed to laugh and said any thing else as if we were exaggerating a rare weekend away was marred by choosing to stay at grange blooms
