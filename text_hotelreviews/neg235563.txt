very thin walls we had room which is the worst room possible we were woken in the middle of the night by the night guard and the receptionist talking to each other we could hear every single word i don t know if the hotel was fully booked or our room assignment had to do with our cheap booking com rate of gbp but it was very poor regardless besides room service didn t do a very good job as there was an old bottle in our room upon arrival tv was very old and remote did not work due to receiver way below the bed and behind stuff you have to get up to adjust volume or change stations like said our rate was sterling which the hotel in another room is maybe worth but if you have to pay the full rate you can get more bang for the buck elsewhere
