i had booked a last minute trip to london with my partner and decided the hotel rooms looked great on the booing website so went for it i was happy with my booing until i got to our room the room was very small there wasn t enough room to fold down the iron board and iron not with two people having to manoeuvre around it each other the double bed was disappointing it wasn t a double bed it was a bed with a single duvet on the top sleeping in the bed was annoying enough when you re a little bit cold during the night and are trying to keep covered with a duvet but can t because it doesn t even cover your body completely it was a midnight tussle for some duvet warmth between us both as only one person would be fully covered by what the hotel management consider a double duvet on this double bed which didn t even fit us two on laying down on our backs side by side meant that my arm would drop off the edge of the bed it s not a double bed and i m annoyed it was described as a double bed and even more annoyed i had to pay for it
