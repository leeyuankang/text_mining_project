on returning to the hotel late in the evening we wanted to have a drink to finish off the day the lobby bar was empty and being vacuumed so we headed to the skybar which we found very disappointing as whilst not crowded offered limited seating and music was so loud we could hear it from the lift as it was mainly couples in the bar the loud music seemed unnecessary we left without having a drink as did other people who were in the lift with us one other annoying feature was the lifts failed to recognise that you had inserted your key card and therefore on a couple of occasions didn t stop at out floor loads of people were complaining in the lift about this
