it was my partner s very significant birthday and on booking i had requested a room with a view of the river if at all possible as i wanted everything to be perfect on the july days before arrival i received an email offering champagne chocolates rose petals etc at a cost to help celebrate i skimmed it and didn t think any more about it on arrival i was told no rooms with a view were available and i had been sent an email to that effect which i didn t think i had and even if i had how would i cancel and rebook another hotel in london so close to the travel date the receptionist spoke to someone on the phone and asked for executive access i presume to make up for the disappointment i think she was told no and instead gave us four drinks vouchers which we used we were given a small room with a view of an office building on the fourth floor or the option to wait five minutes till for a room on the which she said also didn t have a view today i have checked for an email saying no rooms with views were available and couldn t find it by chance i re read the email about champagne and chocolates received on and buried in the middle is general information saying no rooms with views were available but i had missed it it would have been much better to have explained this at the time of booking so as to avoid great disappointment and no option to rebook anywhere else days before arrival time at the height of summer in london for i expected a little better treatment or advanced warning to mitigate disappointment on the day
