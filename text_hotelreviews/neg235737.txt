we had rooms booked i asked for them to be together months ago when we arrived they were apart and one room was not ready until nearly if i wanted one earlier they would have to be on totally separate floors what happend to check in we were not the only ones waiting i met a couple who walked the streets with their cases until their room was ready also we booked this hotel for the sky bar only to find out under s were not allowed in after so my daughters did not even see it after i could accept but we ve been all over the world in roof top bars and never come across this
