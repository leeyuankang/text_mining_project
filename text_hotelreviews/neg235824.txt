hotel carpark was very difficult to get into and my husband curbed his alloy wheels on his very new car i tried to cancel my booking for rooms minutes after making it i was told that i would still have to pay as it was less than hours before we were due to arrive so they would only charge for one room i said we would still honour the booking and go after all i was still charged for the cancellation although it was eventually sorted out they said as a good will gesture they wouldn t charge me for the cancellation when i hadn t cancelled after all this was more than a little annoying especially after ruining the alloy wheels in the car park
