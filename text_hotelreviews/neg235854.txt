the lifts at peak times had large queues and stairs not next to the lifts lift system not sensible at all have to put card in slot in lift to access bedroom levels then press button even then it didn t always take you to the level you needed we were on level we ended up going back down again despite pressing the button lift was often full but stopped at every level going down and sometimes up frustrating you can request not to have housekeeping and then you get a voucher for the bar great idea but they still came in and changed the whole bed and did the housekeeping then knocked on the door for an unknown reason the day of departure rather early strange also changed the bar of soap each day why what a waste keep it there
