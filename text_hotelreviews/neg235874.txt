they never mentioned how to use the lift with my key card so it took several goes to work it out the mac book instead of a tv doesn t really work it is very far away from the bed and the screen is small my speakers weren t working and when i tried to use it as a computer it said that the wireless keyboard and mouse weren t connected despite the keyboard and mouse not being wireless and being connected so i gave up and used my laptop but the wifi was very good
