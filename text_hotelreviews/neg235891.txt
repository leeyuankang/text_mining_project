we had to ask for our room to be cleaned the next day it was done quite fast when asked however after a full day site seeing and coming back aprox i would have thought it should have been cleaned by this time lifts were a nightmare there was four lifts two broke during our weekend stay they were very unpredictable you would be waiting a while and then multiple time would go past you many people trying to squeeze into a lift as they had been waiting so long still really enjoyed our stay just a few things that could have been improved
