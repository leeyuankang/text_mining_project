indecent haste to clear our breakfast table when we had not finished our meal but had gone back to buffet for something more to eat this happened on each day we returned to the table and had to reorder beverages and cutlery we found this rather annoying as we could not relax because the breakfast was otherwise excellent we felt the pricing was rather steep for tourists with no company to pick up the expenses tab we would love to stay there more often but could not afford to do so
