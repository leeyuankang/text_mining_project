we had a party of booked in to the skylounge for lunch and it was really really disappointing the staff were lovely but totally overstretched the food was disappointing caesar salad a romaine lettuce sliced in half and sprinkled with a hard boiled egg and some dried up chicken long long wait for drinks which arrived in fits and starts we had booked in advance and therefore the size of the party was known before we arrived i do feel that if a restaurant can t cope with a large party size they should say so
