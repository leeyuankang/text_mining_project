huge queues for breakfast fortunately we got up early hotel did warn in advance but did feel a little rushed as you could see the huge queues waiting on a sunday there is the option of skipping breakfast and paying to have brunch in the sky lounge which includes mimosas which i think if i went again i would do instead
