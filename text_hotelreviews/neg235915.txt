breakfast was awful very poor quality and limited selection for the money the size of the restaurant is far too small for the volume of guests resulting in very long queues and waiting time just to get in when you do get a table you are practically sat on your neighbours lap by all means stay here but book room only and eat at one of the many quality restaurants in the vicinity
