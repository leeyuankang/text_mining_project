check out took a wile someone and used our room number to pay for their drinks on the rooftop bar and we has to stand was ages with the receptionist checked threw all the recipts to make sure we hadnt signed it its ridiculous that someone can even get away with doing that bar staff should be more careful also they hold money on your bank card even tho i was paying cash and it can take days to go back into your bank account
