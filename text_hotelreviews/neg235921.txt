the location was absolutely perfect for what we needed however for a tourist there to see the sights i would not recommend it brilliant if you are on a business trip just beware that on weekends the area surrounding it is extremely quiet and some shops are not open at all it is very close to the tube station however it is a bit of a trek if heading to oxford street leicester square as the tube line it is on does not go there directly
