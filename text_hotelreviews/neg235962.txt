did not like them adding service charges to drinks as the drink was very expensive the lifts were out of order and it was an absolute nightmare with so many people in the hotel bar staff on skylounge were very unsociable and bar was manic at times at arrival we were advised a per night deposit was being taken but would be refunded back to our bank if everything was fine never have i experienced this in a hotel
