i was dissapointed the lifts didnt work properly all weekend and we had to wait in a massive line each time we wished to leave the room or travel to the room we where on the floor and ended up carrying all our cases down the stairs when leaving the hotel after waiting for a lift for over minutes reported this to the staff at checkout and she wasnt very helpful
