well when you book a queen room you expect a queen bed which is bigger than a double but a double is all we got breakfast per person a bit expensive and a little too expensive for a bottle of beer in the rooftop bar although it was very nice bit sky high prices in a sky high bar don t get me wrong i loved the hotel but a little too expensive for little things i had a good stay and would love to stay again
