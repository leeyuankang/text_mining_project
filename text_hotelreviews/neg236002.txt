drinks in the rooftop bar very expensive no tv in the bedroom but an apple mac instead this could be used for tv but the screen was too small and dark and the volume would not go high enough also it proved difficult to work out how to use it and turn it off air con was too noisy so turned it off and opened window some street noise overnight
