the service from the staff was poor no booking for breakfast on the system even though paid for in advance room service not available to non members the views from the extremely small room was of all the rest of the rooms so had to keep the curtains closed at all times the executive lounge was basically a room downstairs that had a door and a tv not exactly what you would call a lounge really disappointed with double tree and won t be using their hotels again
