some of the staff were difficult to understand when we upgraded they told us it would only be for nights however when we looked at the invoice later we had got charged double so assumed it was pp instead of per room which we weren t happy about as we felt like we had been misled it wasn t until we checked out that the staff who served us noticed and gave us a refund and then we got told as part of the upgrade that there would be free alcohol drinks in the executive room pm however when we got there there was only soft drinks we asked at reception and they said it was only half half so we were also misinformed about this too so felt like we had missed out on some of the upgrade benefits
