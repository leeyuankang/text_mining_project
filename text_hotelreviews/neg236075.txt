unbelievably my husband arrived before me and was unable to check in as the booking was in my name he gave them my mobile number and they still did not want to let him check in even when he offered to pay again so they could reimburse later as he needed to get ready for our night out and i would only be going to the hotel much later he had to call a a manager very unimpressed as never had this problem at other hotels then there was knocking on the door only for staff to use their key for entry we we re only staying the one night so no need for staff to be entering the room won t stay again
