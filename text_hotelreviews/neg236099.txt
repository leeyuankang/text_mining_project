staff at reception were surly and cold i am a hilton honours member and received absolutely nothing by way of upgrade i specifically booked this hotel for the car park and was told that it was full and there was no point checking later as people were not going to move their cars and that was that breakfast was horrendous with a queue to get in the meal was lukewarm and very average i always stay at hilton hotels when i can but definitely not this one
