the value for money was poor i had very high expectations as i have stayed in a good few places i booked this hotel cause of its name the review and the price this hotel was just over a pounds for nights and the dicount that they were giving i thought i was in for a treat as i have never payed this amount before so yes my expectations were high to relise i was in a box room with no bath and basic it s the most i have ever payed and the smallest room i have ever had and had to ask for a room with a bath the next time i stay went for breakfast there was no bread no juice no mushrooms there was something every morning so for pounds every morning for breakfast yes i was hoping for more like i said the staff were great they seemed to be apologising a hundred times to peoplr they can only do there best but this was not peak time so i can just imagine how that would of turned out
