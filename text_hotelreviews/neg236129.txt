shower screen off the rail draw broken in room layout bad small window and dark over looking well nothing i have found this hotel has gone down hill in the last few years i have stayed a number of times and always get double charged so have started to pay by cash the room booked was per night and after staying in other hotel found this to be very poor for value the room had small window and very dark found the sky lounge staff could do with being more attentive and listen to its customers concerns and not just brush them off
