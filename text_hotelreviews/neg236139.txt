they advertise a cookie on arrival the start of many extras however we were not offered a cookie this year i had decided to pay more for an executive king with lounge access however i was disappointed the room description mentions a coffee machine but there wasn t one and breakfast in the executive lounge was very limited so we went to the main dining room fresh milk in the room fridge would be nice rather than the little plastic pots of long life
