we booked this room as it was our first new years eve together and we wanted something special we were so very dissapointed that we were told we had to queue to get into the sky scraper bar for midnight to see in new year we ended up spending it sitting outside the hotel in a bench very dissapointed when we were told that anyone could go into the skyscraper bar not just hotel guests never again very expensive and felt we should have been advised when checking in about rooftop bar limited numbers we could of then made other arrangements for to see in the new year
