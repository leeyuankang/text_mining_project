the rooms were really disappointing we booked a suite and got a normal room with double bed the suites are normal size rooms with a big television the hotel advised there would be i pod docks there was none and top of the range toiletries wich also none very overpriced for what you get would never stay in the double tree hilton again would use other hotels and would not recommend to anyone very dissapointing
