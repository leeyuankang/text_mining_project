hotel does not have dining facility e g breakfast to handle the number of rooms guests at the hotel so if staying at the hotel and having breakfast there then expect min wait to get into to the breakfast room i complained about this to the the staff and they openly confirmed that they did not have big enough dining facility and guest should expect a long wait so something the hotel are aware of and not trying to correct so the business model of this hotel is to sell rooms but not provide required facilities for dining there are many hotels in same area with lower or same price range so no point of staying at this hotel room were ok but naked and with little wardrobe facility
