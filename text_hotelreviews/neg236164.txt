the location was a bit out if the way for us as we spent most if the time in theatre district and oxford street also don t get mixed up with the other double tree as we did we booked and stayed at tower bridge double tree but initially arrived at london bridge double tree we had quite a trek with a suitcase after the staff advised we could walk to the tower bridge hotel
