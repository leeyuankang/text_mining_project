day before arrival we had the option of cancelling booking and i asked via email rather than cancel and rebooking could i switch to new offer i saw which included breakfast after an email trail between hotel and booking com it didn t happen and i finished up paying for breakfast on top of cost which was disappointing albeit it was a lovely breakfast but i left feeling cheated
