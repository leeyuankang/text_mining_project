there was chaos at the reception desk at all times it was the worst check in and check out i have ever had at any hotel the staff was friendly and efficient but there was no clear guidance on who to help next so the guest were frustrated the gentleman waiting behind us during check in even got rather nasty about it we avoided the reception whenever possible because of it i suggest someone relook at the efficiency of the current process
