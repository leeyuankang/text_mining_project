we arrived around i do realise the rooms are not ready until and that wasn t a problem but a member of staff who booked us in actuality said without my asking if we would like to wait in the lobby they would make us a priority i took that to mean the room would be a little early so we ordered some drinks and it got to and i went to the counter to ask if the room was ready and it wasn t i was told it wouldn t be long we waited until minutes past and still we weren t called it was my daughters birthday and i had a meal booked on the other side of london so we had to leave and book our bags in as time was running late for our meal we also had to ring the restaurant to say we would be late as it took minutes to get there i don t know what time the room was ready as i never got the said call i do feel it is unexceptable that a room is not ready at that i have paid for the room was very basic for the price breakfast was nice but expensive also
