breakfast was a big let down we were seated quite quickly which was good but the day we arrived around the coffee was cold that was put on the table and food was cold in the buffet also a lot of the food had run out and was not refilled on the day we arrived near the end of breakfast my thoughts would be that even arriving at that time there would still be food available this was not the case all the hot buffet was gone and luckily enough i had ordered eggs so my husband and i had to share my eggs and use the french stick as that was he only bread left it also took me three attempts to get tea and coffee not what i would expect for the price we paid and the standard of the hotel very disappointed
