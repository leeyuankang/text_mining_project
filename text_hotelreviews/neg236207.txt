the english of most members of staff is poor they didn t seem to understand a lot and were unable to answer the simplest of questions no information was given by check in staff no check out times we had to find out where breakfast was for ourselves do not pay for the executive club lounge not worth an additional penny we ve stayed in various hotels worldwide with club access and this one doesn t offer any kind of service or comfort more like a cheap bar than a lounge it only offers a happy hour for two hours with excessively limited alcohol wine or beer tough if you drink neither and food which was rammed to the rafters probably because it s so tiny if you re looking for a luxurious relaxing break do not stay here the revelling in the corridors at and the stream of one night stands leaving the hotel at is enough to put paid to that
