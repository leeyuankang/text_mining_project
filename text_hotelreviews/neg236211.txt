paid a lot of money for an executive room and it was extremely small not at all what i expected for my partner and i tried to use the executive lounge but again it was extremely busy and a very small room so we couldn t sit down anywhere my stay in the liverpool at the hilton there was by far better value for money and it provided more of a selection of canapes and drinks available in the lounge overall a very expensive night for a disappointing stay
