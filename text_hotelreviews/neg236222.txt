the room was dark and dingy we only had two lamps one of the others bulb had gone i could barely see whilst getting ready i had to do my hair and make up with the wardrobe open as there was a light inside of it which was brighter than anything else in the room we weren t very unhappy about this but when we tried to tell a member of staff we were hurried along due to there being a que the room was quite depressing and i was very disappointed the sound on the tv did not work we would have opened the curtains for more light but there were so many other rooms facing us that they would be able to see in to our room we usually stay at double tree hilton hotels and i booked the tower hill hotel due to the fact we had always had such good experiences with them i just felt like we were just another number at this hotel and wish we had of gone for somewhere else now
