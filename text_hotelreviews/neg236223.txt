double queen bed is definitely not suitable for a family as advertised by booking com also the hotel wouldn t allow us all to stay in the room anyway booking com did organise a complimentary pull up childrens bed for us as no family rooms were available room service was delicious but language barriers meant we were over charged and had to negotiate visits to our room by the waiter going back and for to his manager to agree that we didnt have to pay for their mistake that was frustrating after a long day with tired children
