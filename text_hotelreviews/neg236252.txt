rooms and bathrooms are very small according to american standards but clean and functional none of the rooms have a view all windows are covered with a business building right in front there isn t much around this particular neighborhood for tourists although the metro station right next door makes it easy to get around i had an issue and it was addressed and resolved quickly but there was some back and forth about how to satisfy make up for it i didn t like the back and forth but again staff hotel manager and guest services were very kind and friendly and took good care of us
