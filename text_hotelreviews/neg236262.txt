the hotel from the outside and the inside lobby was impressive however don t be fooled as the rooms themselves do not fit with the rating and are clean but average which should be reflected in the price we have stayed in other hotels in central london which are much nicer marketed as a deluxe queen the room and bathroom were bland with bare white walls and beech coloured furniture and there was no ceiling or wall lighting just table lamps bed was a normal double with cheap duvet and pillows so don t expect a deluxe queen size the sky lounge bar has great views over london but is pricey and when settling your bill the staff assume that you are automatically going to pay the service charge even though you haven t been waited on at all cocktails with service charge are around
