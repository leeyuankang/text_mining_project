upon arrival to the rooftop bar with my girlfriend we were standing waiting for a drink for roughly minutes to add to the sting somebody entered the bar and the staff attempted to serve them immediately after they finished the coctails that took them minues to make i had to actually stop them request to be served myself i will add that the bar was more or less empty whilst this happened staff non apologetic and rude upon me confronting them the money you pay as well is very steep when you consider the rooms are barely scraping average i assume the pricing is based on their location facilities like the rooftop bar
