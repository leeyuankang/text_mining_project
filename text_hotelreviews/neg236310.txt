booked the room based on photos shown very creative photography also in all my years travelling i have never had to wait in line for mins for breakfast organisation is very poor the location of the hotel is excellent but the very small queen size room inefficiency at breakfast leaves a lot to be desired would not choose this hotel again or recommend it expected so much more
