one of the members of staff on check in was very rude to my friends we had requested an early check in but it was not available when we went back at the correct check in time we were made to wait as the room was not ready and in the end they moved my friends to a different room altogether we missed our dinner arrangements due to late check in rude staff member and change of rooms so lost about two hours of our day the rest of the staff were amazing
