the view from our room was of a railway bridge which is disappointing for a hotel of this star rating however whilst there was a queue for breakfast the actual food was of a good standard with an acceptable choice of food we visit london quite regularly and we have had better deals at other five star hotels our experience is that we can get better accommodation for this money
