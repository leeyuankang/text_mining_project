i was continually disturbed by the cleaners who didn t seem to understand that i was working away in my room and didn t need any house cleaning some guests may appreciate having the beds made by someone else but it s not something i needed and after saying once that i didn t want it i would think they would have got the message and left me in peace this was the only downside to an excellent stay
