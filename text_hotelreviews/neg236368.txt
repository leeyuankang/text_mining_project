i was given incorrect information about opening times for the sky lounge was told so when me and my partner turned up they closed the terrace within mins of us being there this was a special treat for his birthday and that was the reason i chose this location because the views were phenomenal absolutely pointless as we couldn t even take one picture when i was given the wrong times i was also told that all restaurant were closed but we had access to room service great idea until the bill came up to and the food was microwaved and cold on top of it i wasn t expecting a michelin star dinner but something half decent i didn t even finish my streak as i got tired of chewing it and it turned so hard it s like i had a ball of plastic in my mouth my chips and steak were cold which is disgusting finally i asked for the steaks to be medium rare and it couldn t have been further from what i asked for for that anount of money i would expect it to be fresh at least i mentioned this to the person i checked out with and he said thanks i ll pass it on to the kitchen what kind of service is that he couldn t even looked or sounded bothered by it at all it s very upsetting as we didn t feel valued at all i called reception and asked a simple question but the operator ended up laughing at me as if i was asking him something pathetic there was so much sarcasm in his voice and it was simply rude i asked if the sky lounge would be playing any football on the morning we checked out he laughed and said no no no it s not that kind of a bar we most definitely won t be playing the football and he carried on laughing at me i was so shocked from his response and so disapointed that all i could say is ok thank you
