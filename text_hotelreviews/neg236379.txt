be good to have a proper handle on the executive lounge door as guests kept leaving it open breakfast was extremely disappointing my tea was lukewarm and undrinkable and all the hot food was also barely warm strange that the toaster which appeared to be on a go slow was at the opposite end of the room to the hot buffet which added to the problem the juices could benefit from having ice in them the cereal and fruit area was nice though with a good selection to choose from
