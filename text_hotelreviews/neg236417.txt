what spoiled our experience slight y was when are room key did not work and we were met with demands for identification and were then marched to a room where a very polite but slightly embarrassed young man had to show us in and obtain i d before we could access are room paid for in advance with are poccessions belongings and money we did complain it was more to do with who was managing the reception rather than the staff who were all very courteous overall we were given tickets for drinks as an apology i understand security is needed however it was quite embarrassing at the time as we considered the key not working was not our fault however was instructed we had left the key to close to our mobile devices but don t want this to turn in to a complaint as we enjoyed are stay great location and very clean rooms overall the staff were very kind
