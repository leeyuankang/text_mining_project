room service options were terrible after a long journey we wanted room service and were offered pasta with tomato sauce cheese or salad for a star hotel in london this is a terrible service also breakfast chaotic too many people so we asked for it to be sent to our room they said it would be a tray charge it was delivered minutes later but they did take the tray charge off sky lounge very nice views but service charge to hand you a bottle of beer and a glass of wine rooms very basic for star much much better hotels in london than here
