no helpful information given at check in ie where the lifts were were breakfast would be after visiting the shard we arrived back at the hotel at quite hungry went to the bar where they didnt even sell crisps or peanuts so we thought we would go to the room and order room service only items available on late night menu which were not very appealing so asked if we could just have chips but were told no went to bed hungry went to breakfast and asked for a poached egg got my toast ready and waited and waited eventually waitress noticed and chased up where my egg could be twice she did this but after half an hr i was increasingly annoyed and left checked out explained about breakfast but was still charged they said they would give us vouchers for the rooftop bar but as we had to leave was no good at that point will not stay here again
