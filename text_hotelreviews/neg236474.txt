there was a strong smell of sewage drains in the evening from the lifts through to and including the skyline bar we sadly left the bar after just a drink because it was so unpleasant i was surprised when i reported it to your staff in the bar and the following day to the receptionist yet little was made of what i considered a major problem it would be lovely to come back and enjoy the bar in a more pleasant setting
