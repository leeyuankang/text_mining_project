we arrived around on the saturday morning and did the check in at the time of booking i requested quiet adjoining rooms we were travelling with my father in law the check in person booked us in adjoining rooms we spent the day in london and only came back around when we got to our rooms they weren l side by side at all and we were so tired that we decided not to ask to change room and leave things as they were then at around we started to hear very loud music we were in a supposedly quiet room on the inside of the hotel with a view on the atrium and not on the street i called guest services once explaining the situation i was told that it probably was one of the neighboors i told her that it was loud and echoing and i was wondering if maybe it came from the cafe on the floor we were on the the person not particularly nice told me that she was going to check she called minutes later to tell me that there was a private party in the cafe on the floor and that they would ask them to be a little quieter it was indeed quieter for about minutes than started again really loud i called again and another person told me that in about minutes it would quieten down it was about then we went to bed but didn t fall asleep before midnight as the music carried on loudly until that time i mentionned this to the person who did our check out the next morning and basically she said that if we want a quieter room we shouldn t take a room on the upper floors i feel like the staff didn t really care about that noise business i would also like to add that i am an hilton honors member but that booking was made using bookings com so they didn t know we came to stay here in december as honors members and they were al lot nicer then this is not normal they shouldn t be nicer to some guests and not others
