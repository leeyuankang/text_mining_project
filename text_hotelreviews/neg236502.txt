we arrived at our room to find a z bed made up this had not been requested there was only of us also the room was not big enough for a z bed it restricted access to the window wardrobe and other facilities this was removed when we asked i had requested a quiet room yet we were put in a room just below the sky lounge you could hear the constant opening and closing of sliding doors and moving furniture as you can imagine this went on well into the night we paid for access to the executive lounge yet on occasions on a night stay we were unable to use the facilities time the lounge was closed for floor maintenance and the time the coffee machine was out of order and the cleaner was vacuuming surly this could have been done when the lounge closed
