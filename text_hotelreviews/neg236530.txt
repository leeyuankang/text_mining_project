i booked this hotel for a birthday present for nights and its wasn t cheap for the price i paid the quality and standard of the room was not good while the room had an apple desktop this was the only thing fancy about the room double bed was tiny small window with no view basic bathroom and decor in the room and no birthday card on arrival for my partner as promised by the hotel the drink prices in the sky rooftop bar were very expensive and overpriced
