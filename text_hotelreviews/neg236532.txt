upon arrival we were checked into a room that had none of the sockets working only lights and sink in bathroom completely jammed blocked it took a few attempts to find a member of staff who felt responsible for our complaints but eventually we were given another room higher standard and free drink vouchers besides on both mornings we found an enormous queue for breakfast not at the actual buffet but on the door all the way through the lobby to the elevators we had to wait min just to get into the breakfast area there were plenty of unoccuppied tables that just haven t been cleared yet as the restaurant was obviously way under staffed even if the hotel had been fully booked this is just unacceptable some people must have waited up to min just ridiculous breakfast itself was decent but hard to enjoy after such a long waiting time
