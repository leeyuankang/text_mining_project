we paid for a tiny room when we double checked prices night before it had gone down to and hotel wouldn t change price of the room or even upgrade us even though we knew hotel wasn t full some of the staff were quite rude i am on crutches and one bar staff member pushed past me stayed at doubletrees before and had much better rooms for far less price than this was and that was at xmas time bit of a rip off really
