a couple of poor issues first having been out all day seeing the sights to get back to the room for a freshen up and rest found the room hadn t been serviced chased housekeeping who seemed surprised we wanted it done skylounge terrace is open til midnight yet you couldn t but a drink at the outside bar which closed at meaning the bar inside was deep finally paying for a supposed upgrade an extra on checking what i had booked it wasn t an upgrade may officially complain about the last point overall good location but many small things need sorting out for the money you pay
