concierge showed us where we were on the map when we asked for one but give no advice on anything nor did he point out anything of interest nearby we figured it out through the trial and error and got great tips from local tour guides on bus and boat trips that would have been nice to get at the desk on check in and it was quite quiet at the time otherwise the staff were very helpful
