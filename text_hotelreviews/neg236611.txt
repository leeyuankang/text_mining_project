our room was located on floor but the smell from our bathroom was appalling to say the least seriously bad hotel sent cleaner up to spray and put bleach or something in toilet n cleaned shower which masked over smell for about i actually felt so sick from it they said they d move us to another room but unfortunately they were fully booked
