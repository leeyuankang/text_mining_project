check in was chaotic rooms weren t available even though we explained out tight schedule and requested an earlier check in we were asked to come back at but at our rooms still not available we were once more asked if we could come back later they would phone us when rooms ready after our protests a manager managed to locate another available room this was good but unfortunately it was floors away from the other bar staff were quite unhelpful rude almost when we asked what beers were available one doesn t expect to have the fridge doors flung open and contents pointed at as a response to a simple question
