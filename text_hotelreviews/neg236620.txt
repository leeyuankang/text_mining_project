it was quite expensive in the sky lounge bar but again it is something you would expect from a star hotel and stunning views of london the location seemed brilliant via the tube i did look for food places around tower hill however there wasn t any and we had to walk down to st katherines dock so we had a various choice but limited choice of eating places but other than that a perfect stay
