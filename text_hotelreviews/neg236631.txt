staff seemed to look down on you as if you weren t good enough to stay there the bed sheets had marks on them when we came in looked like blood and the shower was leaking wished i went down the road to a premier inn would have had a better welcome and better room for half the price also the pictures didn t match up to the room no nice views just others rooms the key cards also stopped working which meant we could get into our room and there was an additional fee of which wasn t mentioned when booking still waiting to get it back
