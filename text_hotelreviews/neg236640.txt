i have to say we were very disappointed with the breakfast served yes there was a varied choice available more so than other hotels i thought but the bacon was dry and tough the scrambled eggs were very runny and the pancakes were quite rubbery i asked for a pot of tea and i was brought a selection of tea bags and a pot of not boiling water to make my own the breakfast was the only let down of our entire stay
