staff we were told during check in that the car park was full the website specifically states parking wouldn t be an issue yet this was the case and we were asked to park up in the coach carpark a few roads away damper on the day although late check out was requested and approved for a staff member decides to knock on the door at to ask when we are checking out as there was no record of a late check out on the system very rude and disappointing we didn t pay near enough for the one night for nothing poor service we stayed at the mk doubletree the night before where service location was perfect we even received cookies on arrival and price was good
