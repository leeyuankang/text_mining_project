had to change room as there was no view and we had offices overlooking us got changed to another room that wasn t as bad but still had little or no view room was a lot smaller than the review pictures had led me to believe could not eat at hotel as it was way overpriced for breakfast was outrageous and because of this we didn t even consider dinner same as the sky bar just too pricey for the ordinary person plus selection of drink was very limited to poor which meant we only had one drink before leaving even tho we wanted to stay for longer
