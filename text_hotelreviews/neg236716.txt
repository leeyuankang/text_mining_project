at the reception we were asked if we would like to upgrade to an executive room which pushed the peuce up to for the night as it was nye we decided to treat ourselves we were told with this that we would receive access to the executive lounge and a full breakfast our new room was on the tenth floor had a view of roofline and nearly the river but not quite for an executive room it was small i dread to think what the size of the queen rooms are we had a moldy muffin left in he fridge of our room which was a lovely welcome the bathroom was nicely fitted out as expected but with a shower door you had to wrestle with to close and wouldn t actually fully close when you did manage to pull it shut we didn t even try to enter the executive lounge as it had been claimed by a group of fouled mouthed individuals who proceeded to swear at anyone who even walked passed them including an elderly couple their badly behaved children although not as bad as their parents were allowed to run wild until past please note this hotel does not have a restaurant upon coming down for our breakfast we found ourselves sat next to part of the same group who destroyed their table and treated the staff appallingly i am surprised a manager did not come to politely tell them to stop desturbing those around them all in all the stay was disappointed for one of the top london hotels i will not be spending that much on a room in the city again
