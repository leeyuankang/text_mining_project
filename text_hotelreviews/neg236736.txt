i paid for deluxe rather than standard however when we arrived the room and bed was very small we asked to pay to upgrade to a larger room and were told all the room sizes are the same thus was very dissapointing the room was described as very differnt on the internet to what it was we have stayed in many hotels and standard room sizes are bigger
