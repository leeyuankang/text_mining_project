the staff was very pleasant but not that helpful i encountered issues with my stay first my key failed to work times i was told the second time that i could call the front desk from my floor and they would send someone up the time i took their advice and called i was told by the operator that guest services was too busy to come up at the time second i borrowed an adapter to use for my stay and was charged for it on my bill i was not informed at guest services that i would be charged for borrowing it third i do not like to have my room made up during hotel stays so i placed the do not disturb sign on my door i was surprised to find that my room had been made up when i retired for the evening this is a huge invasion of privacy and inexcusable
