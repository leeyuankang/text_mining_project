so disappointed with our stay we were told that we could check in the hotel from we got to the hotel at and our room still wasn t ready we had to wait until until we could actually go to our room we then had to wait a further mins for our bags to be bought up to our room we paid for a deluxe queen room and the bed was smaller than our double bed that we have at home so quite clearly we did not have a queen room and i definitely wouldn t describe the room as a deluxe room we paid to stay here we we re ripped off big time we were told from the hotels website that the more money you pay subject to availability you will stay in a room on a higher floor with a view of tower hill our view was of an open roof tube station we could see people waiting for the train really nice view not worth not even close the location was brilliant walking distance to the station and attractions but that doesn t make up for the disappointment from the hotel absolutely gutted would not stay here again really disappointed
