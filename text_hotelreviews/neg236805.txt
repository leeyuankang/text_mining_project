check in was o clock arrived at the hotel at half got told that my room wasn t ready yet and they will give me a call when ready i didn t get a call till half no warning prior to arriving very disappointing i paid for a deluxe queen room and paid for this room and i thought i would be fairly impressed but it was completely the opposite i felt like i was walking in to a travel lodge room besides the mac computer which is rather annoying when you are trying to watch television on it when it s on the desk on the other side of the room very disappointed and not a happy customer
