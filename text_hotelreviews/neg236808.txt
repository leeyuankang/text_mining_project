i was disappointed in the room although a twin room it was very small and you couldn t walk round the beds also the view from the bed room window was a very close large ugly building however as we were only there for night it was fine but if i had a longer booking i would have asked to change rooms pre travel i was offered an upgrade to a queen room but didn t fancy sharing a bed with my friend the facilities in the room were excellent though
