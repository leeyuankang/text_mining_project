the cold water was out the bigger part of the morning making it impossible to shower i decided to have breakfast which took really a long time before the order was taken and the breakfast was served during the evening on the roof top terrace which is excellent btw we were asked around midnight to leave the terrace because they wanted to close fine not a problem we prepared to leave and took the final sips of our drinks there were still around people on the terrace the so it appeared head of security on the terrace stood metre right next to us and really ushered us off we told him we were on our way maybe he could first tell the other people that the terrace was closing as well he told us we had to leave the way he did that was very aggressive not in a polite manner there was absolutely no need to behave like this we just had drinks there and were going inside in general it appeared that a lot of staff members where either new or very inexperienced
