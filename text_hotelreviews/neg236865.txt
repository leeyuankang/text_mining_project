still lousy internet access and lousy service on internet access staff was very polite and friendly but not able to do much ridiculous to be asked to pay for upgrade for internet for doing business level work vpn and then ahve to face difficulty executing the upgrade for the charge but cost me for the value of my time calling for assistance and waiting for help this makes me decide to use the apex hotel next door which does not charge for higher speed internet and does not present hassles
