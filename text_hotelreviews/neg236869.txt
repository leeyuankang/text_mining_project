booked rooms allocated a room designed for disabled persons with seat in shower etc and the room had an unusual musty smell complained and was told i had reserved a room with diabled facilities which i had not as will be seen from my booking com reference was allocated another room as a colleague was yet to check to his room i asked reception if his room had been allocated and was told it had not i wanted to make sure he was not given the room i had rejected i was disappointed and surprised after the first evening to discover that reception had allocated him the same room i had rejected he was not happy with the room but had been too polite to complain as it was my booking i am not pleased that i was deceived and can t imagine it was a coincidence that he got the same room i had rejected for that reason i would not trust the front desk staff again
