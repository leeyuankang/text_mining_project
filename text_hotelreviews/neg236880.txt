breakfast was ok a little cold really i visited the bar on two occasions in the same afternoon and purchased the same thing both times and was charged a service charge on the second visit i was served to my table which was literally feet away from the bar and expected to pay this on asking for the charge to be removed i was confronted with a barrage of questions why and a bit of an attitude to be honest which did not impress me at all missing a bath from my room i knew there was a shower only in the room however after a long day walking round london and on and off the underground i would ve just loved a bath to relax and sooth my aching body also i thought the lack of information in the room on the hotel its facilities restaurant times etc was not good if i needed to know anything such as where the ice machine was situated i had to ask reception
