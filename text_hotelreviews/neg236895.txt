we love the sky lounge with its panoramic views of london that s why when needing to stay in london with friends we suggested to stay here unfortunately that evening the sky lounge was full of city workers very drunk so falling over the language we were able to hear was shocking it took us quite a while to find a seat and all of us non smokers realised that those sitting on the terrace were allowed to smoke which kept blowing to our table we moved inside after having enough of this to a quieter spot which was lovely for a while until they all came inside at one point i went to the ladies to find some men in there talking to a lady then they dropped their glass which smashed they laughed and ran out we are no prudes and love a good night out but we were not happy that this behaviour was allowed to happen spoil over people s evenings
