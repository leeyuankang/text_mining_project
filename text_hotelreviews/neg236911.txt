on our last night a letter from reception was pushed under our door asking us to make good the arrears on our account there were none we had prepaid i phoned reception and they said i had taken breakfast which i hadn t they accepted this and said they would sort it out next day on checking out i found that the imaginary breakfast was still there on our account when we had checked in the receptionist asked if i wished to leave a credit card to cover extras which i declined to do good job or else the breakfast would have been charged to my account and i may not have noticed i did complain to the front of house manager who apologised and has since emailed with a further apology and explanation of what happened all fine but i would expect such a large organisation to compensate rather than simply apologise in these cases this was our third stay at the doubletree tower bridge and the first time we have had any cause to complain so i wouldn t want to put anyone else off but make sure you double check your bill
