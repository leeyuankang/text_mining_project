we requested a high floor with views we got a second floor room looking directly into other rooms and into the reception area we know we only booked a queen room but i have to say it was the smallest room we ve ever stayed in would it not be better to build the wardrobe fridge area around the bed in order to be able to move the bed away from the wall this would certainly free up more floor space and make it feel less claustrophobic
