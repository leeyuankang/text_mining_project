i have alzheimers early onset and when i tried to pay online for four people in our party their was an hour of confusion from your desk people in trying to process my card i had to make several phone calls to my bank who told me me card was fine and could and should be processed normally which didn t happen so it caused me a lot of stress and anxiety just one day before leaving for london i do have to avoid stress and confrontation but it was an eventful hour for me
