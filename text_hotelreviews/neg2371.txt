the club room was located in the basement with virtually no natural light the cafe restaurant was right next door to the room with grease odours permeating throughout the room the tiny room was decorated in dark stained chipboard and it looked as if it hadn t been decorated in years the room they moved us to the next day was better only as it was lighter don t believe the pictures on the website the staff were clearly not trained in basic customer service as they had little knowledge of solving even the basic of issues and found it difficult to hide their annoyance when i had the ordacity to complain
