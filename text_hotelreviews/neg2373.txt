the room was great for a solo traveller however space and wardrobe would have been a challenge for of us especially if you needed to hang formal clothes the rainhead shower was awesome and the hand held option good if i had a full head of hair maybe a challenge if not wishing to wash it the unenclosed shower great if you do not need to use the toilet or brush your teeth after in socks as the floor gets wet again if sharing would need back up of floor mats slippers etc
