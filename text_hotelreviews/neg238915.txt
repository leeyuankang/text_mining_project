loved this hotel but a serious problem was the lack of a plug near a mirror to dry your hair impossible they gave me an extension cord but still very awkward and difficult also need a full length mirror no way to check your dress or pants i also missed having a small exercise room just one seated cycle elliptical and treadmill would be enough with a space for a yoga mat and foam rollers
