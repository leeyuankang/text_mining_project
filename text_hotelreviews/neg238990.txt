the bathroom is designed only to accommodate a very slim person i had a problem with my door lock and was locked out for over an hour until it was fixed i also had a problem with my safe and it took a very long time to get it opened by the maintenance the breakfast are was nice however the buffet breakfast really not well organized at all there were very few items on the buffet only bread and croissant juice if you wanted something different you had to ask for it but since there was only one person serving the breakfast area it took a long time to receive whatever you would order pity for otherwise nice boutique hotel
