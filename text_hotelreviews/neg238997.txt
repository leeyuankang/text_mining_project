not worth the money i lived in hotel indigo paris before i checked in to this hotel i normally love small boutique hotel but this one is not so great starting from reception i did mention it was my first time in paris and it is our honeymoon hotel indigo was so nice to upgrade us a room for free while this hotel was offering an upgrade for a very high price when they are not at a busy season also when i ordered cups of coffee in the morning euro per cup they tried to charge me another euro for room service fee this is outrageous and crazy i stayed at many five start luxury hotels worldwide before this is the first time someone charged this much for coffee they are also selling their hotel bath robe in the room with a price tag all these things just made me feel that this hotel is very cheap trying to make money in every way possible i will choose other hotels for sure next time i m in paris
