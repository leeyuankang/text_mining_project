considering we paid aud per night for a deluxe room we were expecting a bigger room it was quite small they also had no tea and coffe in the room the staff did bring it up but again for the money you expect more when booking we asked for an effiel tower view they wrote back and said we will see but cant guarantee when we got there they didnt mention it we asked and they said there is availability but not for the solid nights call me crazy could they not havemoved peoples bookings around before got there pretty disappointed
