i did not like in this hotel the staff were unprofessional i had booked rooms one of the rooms the a c was not working and they keep telling us that it is going to be fixed but nothing happened at the end and during my checkout i came to know that some rooms a c does not work at all wi fi was not working the toilet is separate from the bathroom the problem is the toilet very small that if you are a big person you will not fit in
