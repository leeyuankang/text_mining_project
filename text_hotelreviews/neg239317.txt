first of all i arrived lugging bags and there were two ladies at the reception and neither of them acknowledged the fact that a guest had arrived till i opened the door and asked for help with my bags then the lady who checked me in was rude and condescending my husband made the reservation and used his card i had said card on me when i checked in but i was told that since the card wasn t in my name i couldn t use it i m sure she would have thrown me into the street if i hadn t asked if i could pay cash it was even more ridiculous because i had just arrived from brussels where i had used the same card to pay for my room then there was the search for an iron but a very nice member of staff was kind enough to track one down just in the nick of time he was really helpful
