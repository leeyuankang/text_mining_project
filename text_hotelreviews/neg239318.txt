the decoration of the rooms especially the bathrooms quite a bit and the reception and bar a bit was overall terrible the wallpaper in the rooms was coming off in areas and the design choice was terrible the bathrooms looked like something from a russian oligarch s house the carpet in the bedroom was dreadful the rooms are not very big either none of this would have mattered if it hadn t cost so much money a night the value for money was not even close so i would not stay there again unless they halved their prices
