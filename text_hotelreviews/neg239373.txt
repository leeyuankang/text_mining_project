i had a room on the sixth floor the corridors smell there is no lift to the floor the room was tiny and stuffy i travel approximately nights out of the year this hotel was a huge disappointment i simply cannot understand how it scores so highly this hotel claiming it is star is simply a lie this at best qualifies as a budget hotel
