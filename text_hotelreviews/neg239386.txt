the room was highlighted by booking com as an extra special price reduced by eur per night at that price i was expecting a really good room spacious at least but this was not the case the room was tiny with a really small bathroom really puzzling who would be prepared to pay the full price for that room i don t know how these special offer are managed or who makes those decisions but i will be very vary of them in future also worth checking with the hotel directly as apparently i could have had the breakfast for free be very vary of special offers on booking com always check with hotel directly as well if you can
