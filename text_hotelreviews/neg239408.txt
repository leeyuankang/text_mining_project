despite the room upgrade there was no holder for the shower in our bathroom so despite the mugginess of the day in paris we were unable to shower and had to take a time consuming bath instead we struggled to turn on the tv and hairdryer in the morning and had to call for help multiple times in fact and when the gentleman came up to help everything worked straightforwardly i think he flicked the fuse on the way up but didn t say this he just made it look like we had been doing it wrong i felt this was patronising and rude but not worth taking up at the time or at all as it didn t exactly affect our stay hugely
