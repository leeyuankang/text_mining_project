room is really small for a discounted price of euros you d expect a slightly bigger room you basically have the space for the bed and not much more breakfast was not included and again i was put off by the asking price of per person so we had our coffee and croissant outside somehow was expecting to see the eiffel tower from the room given hotel name but no room has a view over the eiffel tower
