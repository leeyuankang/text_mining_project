georges was the only reason i cannot give this place out of he didn t want to renew our wifi for us after the day when we were checking out the following day that day was the most essential looking for flight times taxis check ins etc he made it very difficult for us to get all our departure needs straightened out we had to ask times and he only gave us one for people to share we paid for this night as well so why was he being so difficult to add to the insult he failed to call me a taxi at am after i asked twice when i came down he said i didn t need to leave this early i explained i wanted to be early and he continued to argue with me finally he told me to stand outside near the metro for at the taxi stand i am a yr old woman alone who didn t want to be outside by myself at am another concierge from another hotel helped me and called a taxi he was the most pleasant person and helped me when i was afraid and nervous about my flight the taxi he provided charged me to orly when georges told me was he trying to rip me off why was this man so awful he truly destroyed our end experience in paris
