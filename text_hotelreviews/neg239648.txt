my travel coincided with eurouefa championship in france some roads around the hotel in paris were closed so access was not very easy unload drop off luggage was possible at hotel parking place was minutes walk away from hotel in the basement garage was very clean though of a supermarket which seemingly was an overnight place for illegal immigrants and gave us some scary seconds on our way out of the basement
