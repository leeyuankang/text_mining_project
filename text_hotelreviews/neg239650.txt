due to the fact that we made our booking online it was unnerving to find out that we could get similar accommodation at almost a third of the price paid through the online agent although we upgraded our room to a delux room there was barely enough room for our luggage to stand so i was disappointed with the price and size of the hotel room the staff more than made up in friendliness
