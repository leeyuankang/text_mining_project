the air conditioning was a little flakey and in the end i just opened the large door the balcony since the street outside was very quiet this wasn t a problem in addition i had problems connecting to the internet but since i didn t really need it this was not an issue for me if i had raised both little issues with the front desk i am sure that it would have been solved
