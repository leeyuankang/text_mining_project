nothing i didn t like have seen that some reviews criticise small public areas but if you read the hotel details it is a boutique hotel and therefore one doesn t expect large public areas it may not be in the very heart of the city but it is so close to a metro station and hotels in popular areas are all twice as expensive as this it is just a ten minute walk to eiffel tower and the army museum both major attractions
