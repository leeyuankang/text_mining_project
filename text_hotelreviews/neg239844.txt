the light in the bathroom literally burst when we first got there and there were tiny pieces of glass everywhere the night shift front desk man said that that could happen though he apologized he downplayed it greatly he did come to vacuum the bathroom but there were even tiny chards of glass on carpet in bedroom i was disappointed that the day manager did not mention it we loved the decoration of the room but found it really needed more attention the carpets were not well enough vacuumed and when picking up glass i picked up a lot of dust and dirt furniture also very in need of cleaning and vacuuming we love old hotels with character this one just needs a little more tlc in rooms
