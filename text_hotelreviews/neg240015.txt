overall this is a good choice for business travellers but there seems to be a divergence in the room types on a previous visit i stayed in a room which was much smaller i was very happy with the room provided this time there is a limited number of rooms on the floors many rooms on the ground floor there is a small number of staff who is helpful this is a small hotel with the minimum amenities if you are considering a hotel with lots of facilities you may be disappointed
