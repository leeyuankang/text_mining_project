the receptionist was rude first they sended us a mail with the adress of the parking lot once arrived the parking wouldn t open i called the hotel and they told us that there was nothing they could do for us thus i went to the hotel first to drop of our luggage the hotel is from the parking lot but the problem was on booking com there is a wrong adress the receptionist wouldn t believe me and wouldn t give me the right adress so i had to check it online after we checked in we drove back to the parking lot where apperently is a small button to call the night service but we had to find that ourself the receptionist said nothing once back at the hotel i told him about the button and he said he knew about that he was just laughing with us i have travelled the whole world but this receptionist was the rudest ever the hotel should retrain their employees i m glad it was only for one night
