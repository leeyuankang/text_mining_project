i know there are varying sizes in the rooms available but we were a little surprised to find our room smaller than expected before disappointment could set in we acknowledged we had the space we needed the decor was nice and we found the room pleasant and quaint with its strategic use of space if we were planning to spend more time in the room we would have requested any possible upgrade we arrived a little earlier than check in and were accommodated quickly so service and the quality of the facilities made up for what it seemed to lack in size straight off and we were able to get into enjoying the city right away we had no complaints during our stay but bathrooms can always be a bit bigger when two are sharing
