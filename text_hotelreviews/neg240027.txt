heavy stains on the carpet room shower door missing water all over bathroom very little choice on breakfast not really what we expected about hotel in paris and instead of large double bed we had two single bed attached together what was not really comfortable for couple rooms are nor soundproofed so loud noise when somebody above us use toilet shower etc not really good value for money
