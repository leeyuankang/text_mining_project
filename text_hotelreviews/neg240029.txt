even though hotel parking was advertised the parking was a solid minutes walk away a total palaver to park and to get out of the the car park and the car park had nothing to do with the hotel just discounted rates i had told the hotel i was going to be checking in late then i get a call from the night staff asking for my credit card details i was told the booking was not confirmed and had to pay over the phone to keep the room
