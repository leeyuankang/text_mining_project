the rooms are very very small and they gave us the room beside the elavator first problem is when opening the door of the elevator and our room s door at the same time is very impossible second is everytime someone use the elevator we can here the noise inside our room another thing we booked the standard room with free breakfast and they gave us a very very small room with a double bed in it it was quite uncomfortable to roam around the room because we dont know where to place the luggages good thing we brought smaller bags honestly i would rate the hotel not more than for that on the other hand on the next day my husband complained and they were very kind to transfer us into a bigger room with two single mattresses joined together strangely comfortable tho but still beside the elevator we appreciated it tho
