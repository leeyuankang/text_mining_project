room was very small even for paris and we had upgraded the toilet cubicle was impossibly small you had to leave to get dressed again there was only one of everything despite it being a double room one pair of slippers one bottle of water one sachet of coffee one teabag worst of all it isn t sound proofed as the advert states it was the loudest hotel i ve ever stayed in we were woken all night by people coming and going and doors slamming the air con is also centrally controlled in my view not air con we were there in october however it was still nearly degrees celsius we had no control over the air con so the room was almost unbearably warm at night staff were also decidedly unhelpful and verging on impolite
