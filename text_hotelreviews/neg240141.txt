staff were friendly but a bit disorganised and didn t seem to communicate with each other our rooms weren t ready when we arrived and we had an event to get to within a couple of hours of arrival and needed to get ready we decided to have some food while we waited the food was really nice but we asked twice for cutlery and it didn t come then when we got into our rooms one of them smelt horrendously of sick we called down to be moved but were told someone from housekeeping would come up we waited for half an hour and still no one i had to call down again to get the room changed when i went down to change the keys the person on the desk didn t know about the issue so i had to explain for a time all was good once we moved rooms
