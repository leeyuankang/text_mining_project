the nearest train station was closed and had been for several months for refurbishment also the hotel was undergoing refurbishment of all of its rooms neither of these disturbances were made public at the time of booking but must have been known the bed was very hard and was not comfortable to sleep in hopefully the refurbishment will correct this problem the restaurant menu was very limited and the service despite being almost empty but well staffed was very slow we had to wait over minutes to get our dessert the hotel did recognise this and gave us a discount
