we were not pre warned about building works going on in hotel between so as we like to make the most of the excellent facilities we arrived shortly after check in time so we can relax and generally spend some quality quiet time together but no the noise was ear piercing to say the least the hotel did move us to the floor but works could be heard loudly from reception on floor all the way to where we were relocated on the not impressed really as we know this to be a good hotel feel a bit let down really as we paid for the night we could have got hotels in area half that price for the same time and would have used the free cancellation time if we had of know this was going to be the case even after breakfast you haven t got to check out until noon but at bang on the drilling started like being in a dentist chair so once again not impressed booking com has let us down on this occasion
