well the hotel itself was nice however we were put a in a room superior room that we booked for valentines day as a couple and the staff failed to tell us that every day of our stay from to there would be very very loud building work going on drilling hammering continously without breaks completely ruined our stay there as we couldnt even drown it out with something like the tv as it was so loud even having the tv on max volume you couldnt hear it over the drilling we phoned reception to complain and they said numerous other guests were complaining about this to felt completely ripped off that they took the money when we arrived without advising us about the loud building work which they later admitted they knew would be happening as the builders are there in the rooms next to us on our floor every day to pity cause the room was clean and view was ok but made our stay completely horrible cant believe we spent our days off from work paying to be woken up by drilling and hammering and couldnt even sit in our room in the day at all cause we spent all day trying to get out of there for some peace and quiet the whole thing we booked the hotel to have i was promised after them offering us a free breakfast to apologise that they would refund me half of my however this is yet to happen
