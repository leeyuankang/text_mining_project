i didn t like the fact that i booked the hotel for valentine s day and was woken up at in the morning from the sounds of banging and crashing and drilling coming from upstairs fair enough they have to refurbish the hotel but nobody informed us of it if i knew i would have cancelled and stayed somewhere else i told reception and they gave us a complimentary breakfast and free parking but it wasn t enough to be honest it was ruined and me and my partner couldn t even hear ourselves speak because of the noise in the room
