we didn t like the standard of rooms we were initially offered as it was meant to be superior but not up to premier inn standard the two we were initially offered were tired old fashioned and smelly the price structuring has now become greedy and over priced and that s with a so called upgrade for regular stayers at your hotel we are disappointed being fobbed off with sub standard rooms that were a so called upgrade if we didn t know about the better rooms we would have stayed in the room like my sister had and that was with the upgrade your standards have dropped significantly and with so much competition around you will not survive we will think twice about staying with you next time we go to an event at we asked for freshly lightly fried eggs this morning but were given eggs that had been sitting under a lamp for hours we are not impressed with our experience of staying at the novotel this time
