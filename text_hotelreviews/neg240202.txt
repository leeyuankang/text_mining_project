the staff all over this hotel were to be frank abysmal too many cooks at reception with or members of staff all trying to check us in consequently confusing each other it took far too long to find my reservation despite having all the references to hand the rooms were not made up as twins despite this being a request i had phoned through two days earlier we had to wait for this breakfast staff were useless it took nearly minutes for me to get a cup of tea that i couldn t drink because i needed to leave the bar staff in the evening were competent however i did not appreciate being huffed and puffed at when ordering a cocktail because they re faffy to make don t make these drinks available on your menu if you are not prepared to serve them one bar staff member even said to me are you sure because this will take more than minutes to make i said yes i was sure and he rolled his eyes terrible on check out i was told i could not get a vat receipt for my parking as they did not have the facility to produce this absolute rubbish after another minutes of waiting arounf i was given one what a waste of my time the hotel itself was lovely the staff at this hotel are under trained arrogant and slow for this reason we will not stay here again
