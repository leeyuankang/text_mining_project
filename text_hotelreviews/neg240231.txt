shower had a horrible smell of sewage which meant we couldn t use it in the morning before our big cycle we were forced to change rooms half way through our stay toilets in the lobby were the same so clearly a wider problem pasta we had in the restaurant was very bland and more like something you d serve in a kids menu disappointing considering price not ideal having the toilet in a different part of the room from the sink to wash your hands led to a lot of noise during the night
