in room next to a service door which i noticed members of staff going through when i arrived i could not get to sleep due to the noise coming from the service door area i am not sure if they had a service lift or stairs but it was very noisy this meant i did not have a good nights sleep having to go to work feeling tired and weary not value for the money i paid for the accommodation the breakfast food was average bar snack night before nice prices in bar i guess reflected that it was a london hotel but the did appear steep
