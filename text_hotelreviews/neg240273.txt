the keycard entry to our room didn t work new card still didn t open our door took a maintenance man several trips for tools and an hour into our getting ready to go out time before it was repaired and we could relax quite odd the toilet separate from the bathroom so no handwashing until you went into the bathroom carpet looked a little grubby located under the flight path quite exciting for an hour or so
