a let down was at breakfast we were not asked for drink choices at all and i had to ask a passing staff member for coffee after i have finished eating my breakfast then a middle aged male staff came from behind my back and took the plate from in front of me without saying a word or make his presence known this was very rude and spoiled the otherwise nice breakfast
