it was difficult to get a drink or food from the bar during the day as the bar lady kept disappearing and the food menus where not on all the tables so we ordered nibbles instead and then found the food menu on an adjoining table however we did then order a proper lunch home made pizza and chips which was excellent and good value for money too
