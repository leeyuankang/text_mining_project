poor organisation i clearly addressed the soecial requirements of the room as to have a quiet room and also called reception before my arrival to confirm sadly i still ended up in a very noisy room with horrible noise from the ventilation i had to waste hour midnight to find a different room the hotel did offer me half the price off my booking and the manager that changed my room was responsible but it was still really disappointing clearly the special requirements of the room are completely ignored also the breakfast reception lady was really rude
