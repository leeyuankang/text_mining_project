the drains clearly needed dealing with when running the tap the smell from the sink was quite horrible did not like to fire alarm at two in the morning but not the fault of the hotel the staff dealt with it reasonably well inside but the control over residents once exited the hotel was poor i would suggest reconsidering the muster area and not allowing them to exit with glasses they could then drop on the floor
