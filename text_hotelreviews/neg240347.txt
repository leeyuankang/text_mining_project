the room was unbearably hot the cooling system didn t work at all and was very noisy we didn t get much sleep either night this would put us off staying in future the room wasn t cleaned on the day we had to ring for clean towels and tea supplies when we returned at these arrived promptly but the room wasn t cleaned or bed made we always try to use novotel at home and abroad and this was a disappointing stay
