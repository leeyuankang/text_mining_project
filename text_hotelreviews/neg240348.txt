location is quite far away from central london but the views of the river near the hotel is a nice change from the constant view of busy streets the toilet is a see through glass but with a flick of a button it turns frosted but you can still clearly see the outline of the person showering since the shower is right next to the bed it is kinda awkward trying to shower when you can see your siblings lying down watching tv
