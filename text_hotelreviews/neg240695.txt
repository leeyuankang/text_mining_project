balconies could be improved our king room did not have a city view as stated however we were upgraded on the second third nights at no extra cost to us also as we were celebrating our wedding anniversary we were greeted in our room with a lovely bottle of champagne boxes of macaroons this was a lovely touch on the hotel s behalf
