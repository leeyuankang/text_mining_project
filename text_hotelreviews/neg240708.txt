we booked and paid extra to for the larger room facing the champs elysees avenue but are left feeling very disappointed what is supposedly a better room but toilet fittings and amenities is definitely not up to the standard basic amenities such as sanitary bags are not automatically provided and even after our special request from the front desk it was not given a retractable clothes line is not available in the spacious bathroom with a bathtub which is a shame it would be a great convenience considering we had nights stay and needed to wash and recycle some of our garments and the worst is the toilet not able to flush properly we had to flush few times to have a clean flush we have made the complaint but it remained that way throughout our stay the major letdown for us is the breakfast as we always look forward to the nice breakfast during our nice hotel stays anywhere in the world it s to us a star hotel with a star breakfast for the nights that we stayed every morning we were served the same type of food with very limited variety and so we had no varieties to at least let us have different things every morning bacons are hard and over fried asian noodles are dried up and tasted oddly very sweet omelette prepared on request came out overdone and rubbery not a single type of berries strawberries blueberries raspberries etc are served in the fruits section it s the hotel too cheap to provide us that overall we are very disappointed with the quality of accommodation and food provided by the hotel even though it carries the marriot brand it feels like a star hotel with a nice location as the main selling point the hotel staff are warm professional and always helpful but from the overall experience it will be our first and last time staying at this hotel
