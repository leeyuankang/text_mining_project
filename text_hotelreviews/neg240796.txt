our room was very dark there was no mirror above the seated table mirror was a long one attached to the wall with nowhere to sit or set down makeup and hair products etc the bathroom mirror had no light and only two dull spotlights so impossible to get ready there i appreciate the eco friendly nature of the hotel but the toilet paper was very very poor quality the hotel stated room service but at we were told this was not available to order a drink and snack for the room fri and on saturday night we asked for two diet cokes and again told no but after a few requests this was finally given i wanted to get out of the hotel on saturday night but was told no by a staff member as they were closing the doors so no drunk people could get in after the awful terror attack not great policy from the hotel when locals who were stranded needed a place to just sit
