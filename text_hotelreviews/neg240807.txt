we were a little bit disappointed as even we booked a stay for two night we could stay for one night only we tried to reach an agreement with the hotel up front however there was not room to negotiate we weren t offered any options some credit to a restaurant or for a next stay in london would be nice and would cause us to return to this hotel as all the other things were very good
