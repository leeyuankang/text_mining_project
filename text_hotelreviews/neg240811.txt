i booked the room for people however when checking in the hotel had it down that i had booked the room for person the receptionist advised this was not a problem however when going for breakfast the next day it was down as only person for breakfast too again this was easily sorted so a big thank you to the staff for this i double checked online to make sure it wasn t my error but i had definitely booked room for people
