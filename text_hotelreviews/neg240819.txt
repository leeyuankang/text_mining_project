well over priced staff were all foreign and found it hard to understand what we were saying our room was tiny and shelves dusty was nothing like on the photos glorified premiere inn look our reservation wasn t correct they tried charging us more than our price and our breakfast wasn t included on their screen luckily i had our email as proof so they sorted that out this was a break away from our four children for my hubbys birthday so we were so looking forward to a bit of luxury and we were very disappointed as we previously stayed at a mecure hotel in exeter which was stunning wish i d of payed the extra and stayed at the hilton around the corner
