the basin overflow was full of bacterial growth and the shower cubicle was similarly unclean these problems are only visible when cleaning teeth or having a shower the shower tiling was also showing signs of coming away directly below the shower taps i would suggest you review your monitoring methodology and instigate a periodic deep clean i wonder if you will actually act on this information
