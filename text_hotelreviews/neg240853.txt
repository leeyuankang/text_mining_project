extremely poor disabled facilities poor access for wheelchairs end result was unable to have a shower we were offered a drinks voucher to apologise guess what the voucher didn t cover our drinks so we had to pay we only had a gin and tonic a night per room really sad such a hotel chain has such poor facilities staff did make up for it as they did try so it wasn t their fault not sure id like to try mercure again as we telephoned times to check the disabled facilities yet no one told us it was a high sided bath and wheelchair access was via back entrance for goods deliveries with very uneven surface and no door holds not sure how lone wheelchair bound people manage this thank goodness we had two able bodied friends travelling with us
