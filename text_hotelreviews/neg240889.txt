the restaurant was painfully slow and did not listen to what we were ordering food was mediocre and after dinner i ordered some drinks at the bar which sat there after they told me to sit down they would bring them over i got up myself and got them still awaiting my invoice as i do not know what i paid for and they have taken over for one night with food
