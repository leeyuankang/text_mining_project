prior to coming i was a little apprehensive due to some negative reviews it is true the rooms do need a little refurb but for us it wasn t a big deal as we literally just needed somewhere to sleep there was also a little note in the room stating that refurb is taking place the room was ok nothing special but fairly clean the shower was either very hot or very cold a bit difficult to get a hold of wasn t much to choose from mini bar also upon arrival were given the wrong room but that got sorted out fairly quickly
