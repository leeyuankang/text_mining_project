the beds were comfy but for what i am paying i really dont want beds put together that dont quiet match in height the room was a bit dated for the price you pay there were stains on the carpets and just generally a bit tired there was building work going on so all felt like you were just put in any old room because the privilege room certainly didn t look like it was advertised breakfast was aweful i am sorry to say
