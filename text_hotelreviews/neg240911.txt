the hotel is undergoing refurbishing but not finished yet though when booking all the pictures of the rooms where the new version however nothing was mentioned about refurbishing i consider it cheating our room was so cold that we were heating it with that old style hair blower on the bathroom wall we were forced to go to the lobby to warm up there we left several messages at the front desk but nothing changed the bathroom felt very warn off and it was impossible to take a shower as the water wouldn t go away
