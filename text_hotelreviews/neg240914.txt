i expected a lot better for the price the bed was uncomfortable the mini fridge did not work there were hardly any essentials such as no hair conditioner etc the hairdryer pipe attached to the wall was archaic and ineffective also the staff bordered on rude partially ignoring us and talking infront of us in another language while we waited without an apology other personal issues due to cheap facilities which i won t include i ve stayed in london every december for years and this was the most i have paid for a hotel and it was the least satisfactory very unhappy with our stay unfortunately
