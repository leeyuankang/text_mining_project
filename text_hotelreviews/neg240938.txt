we booked a night stay at this hotel months in advance for the opening game of the rugby world cup with weeks to go we were told there had been an admin error and they were moving us to the novotel for just the opening night not very helpful who wants to move hotels on a night stay they then decided we were allowed to stay but removed the complimentary breakfasts we had been offered which considering the amount of stress and phoning other hotels i had to do following their admin error i didnt think was great customer service
