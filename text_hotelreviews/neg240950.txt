the room was a bit basic considering the money paid but it is in central london so understandable we stayed in a privileged room the breakfast wasn t worth the cost as they only had small selection me and my partner paid pounds to have a yogurt and a bit of toast location wasn t that great as quite a walk to london bridge but there were lovely restaurants around that area
