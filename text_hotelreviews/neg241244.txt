the hotel is tiny you do not feel at large anywhere in the hotel the hallways are so narrow that if you meet someone else you need to negotiate to get by lest not even talk about getting around the cleaning cart the room is very very small when i read the reviews i thought rooms are always small in paris well this was a new level of smallness the queen bed is against the wall so it feels way smaller than a queen there is only room to open one carry on bag to open the second bag we had to clear the desk and put everything that was on it on the floor under it and use that space to pack or access the suitcases we had to take turns while one person sat on the bed and no we are not overweight the neighborhood is dirty and very far from everything i recommend to stay close to republic square instead much easier access to everything the bed is not comfortable at all the mattress is fine but they have put a mattress cover that makes a loud plasticky noise every time anyone moves so not very pleasant sleep the air conditioning is stet in such a way that it hits your face very strongly when in bed and there was no way to turn the fan speed any lower or angle it somewhere else
