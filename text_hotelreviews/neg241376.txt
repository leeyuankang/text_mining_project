i expected more from this property i spent a lot more that initially planned because i really wanted our first hotel to be nice after so much traveling the staff did not really try to help us especially the concierge we had just arrived from america a hour flight plus the train ride plus walking from the train to the hotel and it was i asked for an early check in and they offered normal check in is gee thanks that will help a lot asked the concierge to recommend something for us to do while we waited for our room to be ready you know like in hours and he had no idea what to recommend ummmm this is london you live here he said i don t know what do you like to do do you like to walk yes that s my favorite thing to do tell me where i can take a nice walk give me a break when we finally got back to the hotel they didn t even help us with our bags the room was nice but small the lights were very complicated we couldn t get them to turn off and had to call someone to come up to help i m not an idiot i tried for quite a while if your system is complicated leave some notes or instructions
