this hotel was a bit of a splurge for us so we were expecting it to be nicer than some of the other hotels we stayed at during our trip however this was our least favorite hotel of the trip and the most expensive for the price the rooms were very small and the beds were the most uncomfortable beds we had our entire trip they did not provide a blow dryer and our trash can was broken both the room and the bathroom were uncomfortably small i purchased the executive room for my parents with a king bed and that is literally all you get for almost double the price not worth it at all also the staff was not very friendly overall we were disappointed with the grange wellington
