my daughter had rung on two occasions for a request for a special anniversary of wine and of course offered to pay she was told this was taken care of and we would get complimentary chocolates and water but we had nothing and in fact payed four pounds fifty for a bottle of water it did not matter much to us but she was most upset at this despite that we had a lovely time we would visit a grange hotel again
