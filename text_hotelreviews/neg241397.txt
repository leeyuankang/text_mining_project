we couldn t sleep because the noise of the pipes was unbearable it stopped eventually after am when we getting ready to ask to change room which big nuisance for one night stay and we also thought that it might be the same in all the rooms the noise woke us up before am i assume that the noise stops only if no one on the floor or in the same line is using bathroom the staff wasn t rude but they gave impression that they couldn t care less i haven t argued with them just mentioned the problem we had as there was not much interest to listen i gave up when we passed by later to pick up the luggage no one greeted us both coming in and out not because i complained because there were other people at the desk but just because they don t seem to care it s not really important i know but it s unpleasant it s a star hotel i e you spend quite a lot you expect them to at least say hi
