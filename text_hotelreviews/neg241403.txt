the room was small with only one chair and no suitcase racks my partner put hers on the dressing table and mine was on the floor there was no towel rack to put wet towels on the clean towels were on a rack in the shower bath but you had to get into the bath to reach them as they were at the wrong end our main complaint was the heating system which was noisy and brought up kitchen smells from below also the lift was out of action for an evening and morning and as we were on the floor and the restaurant was in the basement it made it difficult for my partner to negotiate the stairs
