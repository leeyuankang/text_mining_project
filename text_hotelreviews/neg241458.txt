the only things that let down our stay was the super uncomfy bed it felt like sleeping on concrete and i suffered for days after with a painful back on the other hand however my fiance slept like a baby and was very comfortable also the window in our room let in a bit of noise from the traffic outside we swis try to close the window more but it wouldn t budge thus didn t impact on sleeping also the breakfast is priced far too high can t justify spending over for one cooked breakfast
