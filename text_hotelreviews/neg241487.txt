the seemingly professional character of this hotel wears off quickly we were first given a room with no windows not unusual for london but usually comes at a decent discount not the full rate we paid then one with a very noisy cooling aggregate running at full throttle just outside making sleeping almost impossible after an almost sleepless night we were finally given a decent room worth the money by far the worst offense was calling an unlicensed overpriced by almost illegal cab whose driver had no sense of direction after i asked for a normal taxi to the train station couldn t change this due to lack of time didn t expect this from an otherwise modern hotel be aware call your own cab at this hotel and be aware of their practices
