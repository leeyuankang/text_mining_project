i came here for my anniversary it was a suprise for my partner i had emailed the hotel a few days in advance asking if it was possiblefor them to put a little suprise in thr bedroom waiting for us for when we get there explaining it was our anniversary they confirmed this and said it was dully noted when we got to the room nothing was there empty annoyed and slightly embarressed that i had to go and ask about what happened down in reception i found out they forgot to put it in there the receptionist was very apologetic and i could see she was annoyed too the bellboy or whoever they are called said to me that he didn t put the cake and fruit in our room because it would melt then it took him another minutes to bring it up my other half wasn t impressed it also completely ruined the mood room service was awful too we got back from the theatre late evening and knew the restaurant would be closed so we ordered sandwiches at and was told it would take half an hour because he had other orders of sandwiches come through i didn t need to know that really it took an hour and a half for them to finally bring it up for a vegetarian club sandwich it took and hour and a half they then forgot the grilled chicken sandwich we had asked for too so that was another hour almost considering the hotel is lovely and quite glamorous they weren t a sorry bunch for keeping us waiting almost half hours for sandwiches he also brought the bill up for us to pay when we had already told him that we will pay at check ou not listening much i m not usually the one to complain about things i rarely write reviews but since i picked this hotel to stay at for our anniversary i thought i would say something
