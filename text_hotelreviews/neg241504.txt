we ordered a taxi the night before our departure for early the next morning on arriving at the reception in the morning the gents at the desk seemed flustered and only then called us a taxi the taxi was almost minutes late when it arrived it was an unmarked car and seemed to have no meter for charge when we asked the driver how much it was to the station he said that they told him which is times the amount that our london based friend had said it would be to that station we were clearly unhappy at a late taxi which had been prebooked and then being ripped off by the unlicensed taxi that did pick us up after almost missing our train to the airport we were most unhappy with the staff at reception who seemed to be almost useless and we are unsure whether it was even a licensed taxi company definitely not a good note to leave it on and we would not return
