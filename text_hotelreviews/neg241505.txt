the check in staff member who apparently was the supervisor offered me a room which is half the size of a standard double room from what is advertised and mentioned on the site i raised this issue with her and told her i need a room similar to what they mentioned on the site as that is what i paid for she then offered me a standard room which was bigger she was just being sneaky by giving me a small room and savig bigger ones not at all impressed with that do make sure you check the room you booked for and get that when checking out one of the staff members said there is a due on my account and i had already cleared all my bills at the time of check in i didnt question what this was actually for since i was running late for my flight and offered a note coz i didnt have change he gave me back a plastic bag full of coins totalling upto and said he doesnt have change it is atrocious for him to do that i didn t have time to argue so i left
