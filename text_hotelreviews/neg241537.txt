one of the receptionist seems a little bit cold but since that was a big rainy day and we carried large luggages with us can t blame her too much the victorian train station can be confusing and it s the time of reconstruction so the train and tube station can be even more complicated we finally decided to go to st james station instead of victoria it s far simpler and takes exactly the same time the fire alarm made some beep noise about every hour we were allocated to the first room faced the stairs so it can be not quiet in the room but still didn t bother me too much
