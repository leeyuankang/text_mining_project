my room was on the second floor on my first stay and on the third floor on my second stay so there was a bit of stair climbing involved especially since the dining breakfast room is in the basement however they are currently in the process of installing a lift so that problem will be rectified shortly and there are staff available to carry luggage to and from rooms the only other issue i found was that the beds were a little firmer than i prefer but after one or two nights i adjusted to them and it did not affect my sleep
