seemd a little far fetched to have to wait until check out day to receive information from reception whether a later check out but before ordinary check in time would be acceptable while the breakfast choices were generally ok there could have been a plate with raw vegetables such as cucumber and tomato no salt on the tables nor a cook making that omelette francais also while there was fresh orange juice there was no other type of coffee than black americano which was not really of the finest quality cappuccino etc could be requested from staff but given breakfast here was a self service buffe one probably wants to engage with staff as little as possible to fully enjoy their breakfast especially that drinks were also self service the interior design of the breakfast room seemed to distance itself somewhat from the very nice decor of the hotel esp the courtyard making it not as pleasant to the eye as it was to the taste buds combined with the fact that breakfast is basically in a basement some work probably needs to be done to align it with the same feeling one has at the courtyard possiblity to use the provided smartphone more than just a smartphone would have provided a true century experence while the smartphone came with an internet connection possiblity to make free calls to selected destinations use maps and had a pre installed paris guide that was it for the regular eu traveller owning a smartphone and having an internet connection in france without the roaming charges this wouldn t give much unlike for non eu travellers who might benefit at least from internet on the go while visiting paris would have been much more interesting if it could be used as a room peripheral as well e g to control the a c turn lights on off etc it s time to upgrade the room safe despit box as it seemed rather outdated and had a too long digit combination given what others offer
