it was impossible to contact the hotel from abroad the service people online were literally not knowing what they were asked for it took me a month and more than calls to booking com to get booking com representatives to contact jardins du marais i needed to change my stay in the hotel for day due to the change of the grpahic they could not move this booking for one day and it took me forever to agree with them booking of another one day and joining the orders when i came to the hotel personnel promised a compensation for the one day that we did not stay in this hotel but on the last day they said that this could never be done the hotel may be good for people travelling from france but absolutely horrendous for foreigners
