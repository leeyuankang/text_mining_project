called up hotel to ask if i could leave a bag two days prior to check in and was informed this was ok on coming to the hotel i was informed i could not do so i would not have minded if i was given the correct information when i first called secondly the receptionist on duty did not handle the situation well she was unsympathetic and said i may have misunderstood what was told to me by phone implying either i do not understand simple english or perhaps am too stupid to understand the halogen lights in the room are too bright and glaring
