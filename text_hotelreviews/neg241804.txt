warning for international guests keep your passport locked up in the room safe at all times do not leave it out in your room or your bags my story within minutes of checking in i left my room to have dinner when i came back my passport was gone and the various cards i had inside of it were on the floor the hotel desk staff helped me look for it in vain but their attitude left me wondering how often this happens at this hotel i d typically chalk it up to being forgetful but the evidence stands my passport and only my passport was taken from my room after asking around i ve found that passport theft from hotel rooms is not uncommon in paris given my experience at this hotel using extreme caution with important documents is absolutely required at this hotel the first room i checked into was not cleaned even though the receptionist had called the cleaning staff to make sure the room was available that said the receptionist made sure to put me in another room immediately which was cleaned and they ended up not charging me for the room upgrade as a result which was much appreciated the room i ended up in had water damage to some of the carpets as well as various issues that made this star hotel seem more like a star like broken plugs odd fitting appliances and the like also don t order room service after even though there is a restaurant on site they will tell you that they are out of whatever you re looking for upon leaving the hotel to seek food elsewhere you can stroll past the restaurant and see that they re serving the same food they re supposedly out of ridiculous
