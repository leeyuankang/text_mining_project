it is not a good area full of ho bo s dog shit and dodgy massage parlours and no real tourist attractions the restaurants in the area are mediocre if you are a tourist i recommend the i paid my bill the night before because i had a start the following day the receptionist screwed up the check out and in the morning i had to spend minutes convincing the night manager that i had paid my bar bill the night before he simply did not believe me until finally he realised that i had been charged twice for the same drinks then i found out i had to pay more for the city tax because the day staff had not included it in my bill the night before overall a very poor and amateur response from the staff and unpleasant experience for me the delay almost cost me my flight
