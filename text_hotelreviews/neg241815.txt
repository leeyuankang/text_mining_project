despite being polite i think the staff need more training my room service order charcuterie and cheese plate took over hours to arrive and after several calls to room service apparently they wrote down the wrong room number then i had asked them to book a taxi for the next morning and when i checked out i was told no taxi had been booked the staff sorted it out quickly but it could have been a disaster as the start of ramadan month meant fewer drivers were working so although the staff were pleasant these hiccups made my trip not very pleasant
