the lights in my bathroom weren t working but i got around it also the neighbourhood that the hotel is in comes off a little sketchy but the more you walk around it is better distance from the hotel to the more touristy spots ie eiffel tower arc de triomphe luxembourg garden are a little far if you re walking great alternative as paris traffic is terrible
