the mattress was probably the worst mattress i have ever slept on in a hotel if the hotel were a two star this would be somewhat acceptable but it is unacceptable for a four star there is nothing worse than taking a nicer hotel with the hope of being rested for business meetings and in the end getting a horrible night s sleep also i could hear pretty much everything in the room next to me as there was a door connecting the two rooms i could literally hear someone masturbating on the other side of the door once again that may be expected at a flophouse but not a four star hotel
