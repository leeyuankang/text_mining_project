the first room i was given had a howling dog locked in the adjacent room i was moved to a new room on the third floor by tim on the desk who is brilliant the door to the lobby was also broken necessitating a detour the elevator has been broken for a long time in the eiffel building and so i found myself needing a porter to help me up three flights with my bags and a lot of extra traipsing up and down i had problems with my air conditioner which was fixed quickly the curtains cannot be drawn shut and my room was boiling hot without the aircon and it made an afternoon nap hard with the sun streaming in decor a bit tired my toiletries were not replenished breakfast was abysmal and an absolute rip off at considering these points i don t think this hotel earns its star rating
