we ordered the romantic package that included a room upgrade and several other things on arrival they had no record of the order and when we said ok we ll order it now were told it was different from the website and anyway they could not upgrade they gave us a very small poky noisy room with dirty carpet we should have complained but were too tired from the journey the following morning they found our romantic order but their interpretation differed from the website that i had managed to show them the helpful manager upgraded us since the original room was so poor no proper restaurant breakfast too expensive previously we ordered direct not through booking com and received free breakfasts
