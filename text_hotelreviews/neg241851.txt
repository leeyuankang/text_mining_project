i really don t know who assigned this hotel as a star hotel the staff were not friendly and polite as it is expected in a stars hotel the rooms are decorated with cheap old wooden furniture and is not in accordance with a stars hotel we had booked suits and they were in rodin nos and in room we were suffering from the smell and odour of the kitchen my mother an year old lady was in the room and unfortunately the bath was not designed for an old person as she couldn t climb the bath tub and take a shower during her stay in my mothers room the air condition was not working and the room was cold and when we asked the reception then nothing was done simply ignored us our complaint and asking to change the room had no success and we had to bear the unpleasant situation actually we paid a high price for both suits but it didn t worth they offered the free wifi in all areas but it is ridiculously a fake network you can not even check your mails with this offer the offered per day for a better connection and it is funny that it is only for one gadget it mean if you are a couple in a room and each have gadgets a laptop and phone or a tablet then you have to pay per day the expensive rooms were offered without any meal we paid per person for the breakfast with this price the breakfast was not a proper and suitable due to the price and the claimed star accommodation it was a simple breakfast equivalent to a star hotel the staff were impolite and ignorant and simply ignore any request or complaint the hotel was full of group travellers and not a relaxing place
