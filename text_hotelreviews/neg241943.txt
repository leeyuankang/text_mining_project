this property was not up to any standards pillows were so old and should have been replaced long ago the tap on the bathroom sink barely ran water the room was supposed to be for three people and there was literally no room for luggage we had to open one case at a time as there was no room for us to manage all three pieces of luggage the chair opened up to a bed which was so uncomfortable that my grandson had the worst sleeps in the days we were travelling when i went to pay i was told that my credit card had already been charged no where in the eight hotels i had booked for our trip did the hotel charge my credit card without telling me i would not recommend this hotel
