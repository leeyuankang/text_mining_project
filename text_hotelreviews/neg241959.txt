this place is the most disgusting hotel i have ever seen in my life if i could have imagined that such places exist i would never have booked a room there booking com was not explicit about the type of room i was being offered and the price did not indicate what i was going to find on arrival what i was offered was not a room but a cupboard with a tiny bed in a niche overlooking an overgrown dirty backyard with no light and no ventilation there was no space to open my suitcase even i would not call this a room or offer it for this was a disgrace on the part of both the hotel and your website i did not sleep in the room and of course there was no refund this was the first time i used booking com and i think it will be the last very poor quality hotel no value for money and no explicit information to customers about the disgraceful state of the so called room that was on offer
