access to the room wasn t good as i had to walk up flights of stairs through fire doors and down flights of stairs to reach it it was a ground floor room with window wide open on arrival not very safe for a lone female traveller the room was not properly cleaned after the first night bed not made only one of the two bins emptied and dirty cup left the breakfast was ok but staff got part of order wrong on first day for the price i was disappointed
