this definitely not a four star hotel we stayed on campsites that were cleaner and safer than this hotel our room was tiny and had mould all over the wall the window was broken and open to a construction structure that is holding the building from collapsing the tiles in the room bathroom were broken with gaps in the floor we felt very itchy when we were in the room and had bad allergies very dusty and dirty room staff were incredibly rude and are mainly backpackers or recent arrivals to the uk who completely miss the point of customer service we had an instance where we required assistance in our room and staff just hang up the phone on us times for simply asking whether the hotel provides shampoo and body wash after multiple calls we were informed they forgot to order any usually i ll be ok with this but not sure why they hang up in our face we had to walk through the kitchen area to get to our room which feels like an worn out tiny attic staff were very noise because of gaps in the kitchen ceiling we could hear them speak at random hours at night very loudly they also wake up early for their shift and have random chats outside our door i m shocked that booking com doesn t verify descriptions and hotel ratings provided and allow a hotel like this to advertise a star rating highly upsetting and concerning
