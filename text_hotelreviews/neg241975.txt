frankly the single en suite room was insulting for the price charged the window would not open the cords on the pulley system had been severed and the room was only as wide as the length of a single bed there was hardly room to swing a cat in it i complained to reception about the window and was moved to another single room where the window did open but only because toilet roll was wedged beneath the window to create an opening i was put in a different room for my final second night to compensate which was a much more spacious triple room
