rooms the hotel is very small so they had to use up every space possible our first night they put us at the bigger room but it was right next to the kitchen it was loud by the bed was extremely firm the next day they moved us to a bigger room than what we would ve gotten originally which was a lot quieter away from the kitchen n the streets but the bed was very small little bit smaller than double but better firm wise than the it worked out great for us because i like to snuggle to my husband anyway our neighbors was loud in leaving in the morning slamming their door the rooms have no a c so we had to keep our windows open to let the cool air come in fortunately enough the air does get cool enough at night but i can t imagine during the hot summer the window at our room can t stay open on the bottom had to put a kettle to hold it open stairs no elevator our first night we stayed at lg that was only one floor down when we got moved to g floor supposedly the same floor as the reception room but you have to go down one floor go through the breakfast room n up one floor to get to our g room
