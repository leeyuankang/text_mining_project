you pay a lot for a hostel because i can not consider that a hotel the room is very small old no really clean the waitress are not good never hello bye can i help you i am not saying that i need that they smile or be friendly but you are working with customers you have to have a different attitude they don t have a room where you can keep your luggages so if you arrive before you have to leave them in the middle of the reception i am very disappointed with hotel cavendish
