the room we were located in was next door to the breakfast room and so we had early wake ups everyday as the staff were setting up and from then on until breakfast had ended the breakfast room was small and couldn t always accommodate all those that were staying as it was always busy on one day us having to wait for an hour for a table to become available the room was also located near the staff entrance from the street and so again was always fairly noisy
