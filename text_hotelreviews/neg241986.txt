this was a typical budget hotel in london a little drearier and mustier in its furniture and decor than some of the other gower street hotels the windows wouldn t stay open so it was impossible to get fresh air and even when the temperature was pleasant outside it was sweltering and stuffy in the room the rooms are very tiny and cramped so if you need to spend any time in your room or hotel to work or attend to business this hotel is not a good choice there is no place to sit besides on the bed itself the poor water pressure was to be expected in a london hotel in this price range the breakfast is pretty standard except for the instant coffee which i found disappointing even in comparison to other hotels in this price range while the bathroom and washable bedding seemed clean the carpets and curtains and decorative pillows badly need to be freshened up i don t think they re dirty exactly but they smell musty and look very worn
