originally booked the cabin room then upgraded via you to a single room but on arrival told i had to have the cabin no upgrade from you he said would not tell me if there was a single room available or not spent dreadful sleepless night right up against a draughty old window with street noise etc so asked to be upgraded the next morning even to a double room told no upgrade from you but when i presented your print out was then moved later in the day to a single room which was fine and had secondary glazing re traffic noise their www site which boasts a refurbishment is none sense a cushion and a useless short bed cover you really should consider de listing this place what use is a wardrobe with only one coat hanger etc etc etc its a tired distressed place in much need of the refurbishment they claim to have made would have to think twice about using your site again sorry but just not good enough all round but they did not charge me for the upgrade on the second night breakfast was good with a hardworking staff p s tv remote did not work on the second night
