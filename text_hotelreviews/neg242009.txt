i booked a cabinn the room was very very small the windows was broken and room temperature was around degrees the room was so small and dark that everything seemed dirty cracks in the sealing with discoloring around them bathroom floor was ice cold i booked it for two days left after one with no refund of the second day but would not stay there a day more for obvious reasons so please think twice before booking a cabinn and don t do it if the quality of the room matters to you
