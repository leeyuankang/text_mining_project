mice running around in pairs towards the dinning room when the staff were informed they seemed unbothered by the news and certainly didn t leap into action no refund for the breakfast which was included in the price despite protestations that i was certainly not going to vie with rodents for my breakfast three blind mice has been playing in my head since my stay i never did find the third and i m not sure if i m glad about that or not the description kept stating it was in camden i m not sure if this is a ploy to attract tourists but this place is nowhere near camden town unless they moved the british museum while i wasn t looking it is central london but that s about the only thing going for it imo
