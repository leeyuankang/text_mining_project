there were cobwebs on the ceiling and the net curtains were grey and stained with paint but apart from that the room and bathroom seemed clean our bedroom was on the lower ground floor adjacent to the breakfast room and the window of our bedroom faced out towards the kitchen essentially then our room was between the kitchen and the breakfast room therefore we were woken at by the sounds coming from the kitchen and breakfast room as the catering staff were preparing this was not the fault of the staff it was just due to where the room was located the stairs are winding and carpeted unevenly so climbing them felt a little unsafe
