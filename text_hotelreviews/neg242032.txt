though the toilet shower was clean the tiles on the floor were damaged and loose not good to walk on barefoot they could easily be repaired but looked to have been this way for quite sometime the additional single sofa bed made the room cramped when opened could have done with a little more thought in the layout of furniture i was tempted to move things around myself the double bed was comfortable but my daughter had difficulty sleeping on the overly hard sofa bed
