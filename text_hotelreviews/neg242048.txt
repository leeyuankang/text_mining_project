the room we stayed in was a family room however the extra bed was a very uncomfortable sofa bed which when it was pulled out left no room in the bedroom the shower was less than adequate and the bathroom could do with a deep clean the towels were not changed nor beds made for the two days we stayed there our room was in the basement which looked out onto a rather dirty back yard this room should not be used for paying guests
