dim light in room drab worn out decor very very noisy thin walls such that you can hear everything going on in rooms next door and in the corridor stains on walls and carpets cleaning standards dubious very small room all in all if you need somewhere to just crash for the night but can afford not to sleep very well as a result of the noise then it s ok i think if you don t have many expectations then you probably won t have any complaints but i think the hotel has been advertised as something that it isn t it s not a or star hotel as shown on some websites at best it s a star guesthouse if that s made clear when advertising then it ll probably get better reviews i went in expecting something of slightly higher standard will make sure i do my research better next time
