there was a fire alarm from am to am on two consecutive mornings no one checked whether i was alive or dead and when i asked to speak to a manager on checking out to sort out a refund i was told to be quiet by an insensitive and unprofessional young man whilst his colleague laughed and agreed with me that he was not in a position to tell me to be quiet days later i have still heard nothing from them about any recompense and i am disgusted with their customer service
