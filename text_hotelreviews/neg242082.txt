when we arrived and got our room it was a big chunk of hair in the shower i went to the reception and told them this and they said they would arrange it it was in the shower during out whole stay room wasnt very clean either and we found hair basicly everywhere they could use a vacuumcleaner during our stay they only cleaned the room once wifi really bad to sometimes it worked and sometimes not and when it worked it was very slow
