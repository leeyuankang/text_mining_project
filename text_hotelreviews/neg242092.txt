i booked a single cabin room and what i got were two tiny closets one the bathroom one the bedroom connected by a tiny entry hall smaller than expected but manageable however the bathroom had no heat source and direct access through the ventilation fan to the outside the radiator in the bedroom couldn t compete with the cold air coming in through the poorly sealed window because of these things the bathroom was absolutely freezing and the bedroom was quite cold the sink in the bathroom was clogged it would fill almost completely every time i used it and then take several minutes to drain i complained about it twice to no avail although i was told the second time that the man looked at it and found a small cap from toothpaste or similar inside it continued to be a problem i gave up on complaining the bathroom walls and ceiling had visible mold and the ceiling was covered in droplets of condensation that would occasionally unexpectedly fall as little icy surprises the lamp in the bedroom though unnecessary was visibly broken there was only one outlet in the whole of the room behind the door and i had to move the table to it in order to plug in and use the kettle which was filthy when i arrived the wardrobe contained only two hangers making unpacking impossible living out of a suitcase in such a tiny space was difficult to say the least the wifi connection was terrible or non existent throughout my stay when i asked about the poor quality of the connection it was suggested that i try connecting to the password free wifi of the hotel next door
