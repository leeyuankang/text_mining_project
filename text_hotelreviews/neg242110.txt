we were a group of colleagues we had booked a few single rooms and a few double rooms but unfortunately we didn t notice that those double rooms also had double beds i noticed one week before arrival and so i immediately called the hotel the receptionist was very relaxed and told me to call back one day before arrival he would sort everything out i arrived one day before arrival of the group and headed straight to the hotel nothing was arranged the same guy told me to check on arrival the next day when we arrived the next day it was another receptionist who wasn t informed at all i explained everything again and gave him our rooming list so he could prepare everything for when we would check in late in the evening finally when we arrived another receptionist was not informed so i had to explain everything again for the time we spent minutes after a very long day to sort out all the rooms not professional at all the breakfast was not that great either it was very dark in the room as the lights were broken i ordered scrambled eggs and had fried eggs luckily this was replaced immediately not much bread available only toast the shower was verrry cold and then semi hot and then freezing cold again
