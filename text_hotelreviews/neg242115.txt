service at breakfast was incredibly poor completely ignored for minutes whilst other people were acknowledged and had drinks made for them we got our own tea in the end and waited to try and order breakfast again other people who arrived after us managed to be served and order their breakfast finally our invisibility seemed to go and we ordered our food which unfortunately was then wrong even after repeating it to two separate people one spoke better english but seemingly scrambled egg on toast is a difficult request i d recommend skipping breakfast and going somewhere with staff who know about customer service
