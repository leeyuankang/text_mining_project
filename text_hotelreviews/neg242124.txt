tired rooms and the breakfast was very small but very tasty we were in the lower ground rooms and there was loads of road noise due to no double glazing plus the actual windows rattled in the frames when anything went by shower was little more than a trickle in one room the tvs were ancient and the remotes didn t work very well in my opinion it s a room not the we spent each it would have loads of potential they need to invest it was ok for a quick overnight stay but one poor nights sleep was enough for us
