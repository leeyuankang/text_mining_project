incompetent porter unavailable to supply a duve for the bed in a booked bed room one guest had to use a sheet also the third bed was the worst bed ever with springs sticking up your bag and finally the room was very small in the basement and next to the kitchen with the noise and smells you would expect and as we were forced to pay for two nights over weekend even we only needed one it was not because it was cheap one hotel i need not to see again
