the room was not nice at all it had nothing to do with the photos the floor on the bathroom was broken there were doing constructions outside the window and it was noisy we had booked a three bed room and they gave us a room with one double bed and a couch where people could hardly fit in the staff was ignorant seemed very bored with their work we thanked them in the end for the accommodation and they were too busy with their papers to say at least thank you for staying with us such a disappointment
