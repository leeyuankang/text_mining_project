the shower sprinkler head was in bad shape so we didn t have a nice flow of water to our bath we are from portugal where the electric sockets are different from those of u k we forgot to take a socket adapter so we ask the guys from the hotel if they could borough us some since every hotel we have been usually has this they just told us to go out and buy one not a good service also when we got there our daughter s bed wasn t ready yet they told us it would be ready later that afternoon when we got back it wasn t ready still so we had to wait again in the end of our stay they didn t asked us about the quality of our stay they just said bye
