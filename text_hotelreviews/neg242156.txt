wifi is quite flakey with intermittent speed problems the bathroom was clean but absolutely tiny no room to stand anywhere in general single rooms are very small though i suppose if you just use the room to sleep in that doesn t matter so much nb no elevators so if you have heavy luggage and your room is on the floor you ll be carrying that up the stairs
