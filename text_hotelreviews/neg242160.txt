the first room offered was tiny little bigger than a broom cupboard with a shower in it not even enough space to open my large suitcase the second room offered below basement level was noisy as it was on street level and the window couldn t close so the sounds were disturbing trying to work the window left my hands greasy with dark grime due to the noise i had to move in the early hours of the morning the room was larger and quiet room i think but had a damaged carpet and water damage near on the ceiling near the window it smelt musty the bathroom ceiling was mouldy above the shower i could not sit on the toilet no leg room had to sit sideways the telephones did not work for days could not dial out no instructions in the room on how to operate the phone dialing out codes reception number etc the pillows were flat hard rendering them uncomfortable to use the light shines underneath the door at night the gap is too big and needs a strip put at the bottom of the door my own fault i overslept and came min late for breakfast on day staff were unfriendly and i was clearly a nuisance and inconvenience to them no offer of even a piece of toast butter or jam overall this hotel does not deserve the appellation of stars it simple misrepresentation
