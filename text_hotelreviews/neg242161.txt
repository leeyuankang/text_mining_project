waited a good minutes before anyone appeared at reception a total disgrace and no apology for me having to wait i was tired and just wanted to get to my room room full of hairs grime and pieces of food on the floor i needed a shower desperately but couldn t bring myself to go in there it was just completely grotty and they clearly don t have any standards when it comes to cleanliness i had to use my elbows to flick light switches because i couldn t bear to touch anything
