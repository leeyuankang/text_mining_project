the window in the room opened from the bottom upwards from the floor level to ceiling it was fully open when we arrived and with no safety barrier only a sheer curtain covering it this was very dangerous as you could not see the window was open we were on the floor so it would have been a bad fall if someone didn t realise or tripped on the curtain there was no a c so the window was the only source of air after closing it up well down the window also dropped down from the top so i kept it open from that on return from our day trip the next day though it was fully open from the bottom again i forgot to mention it to reception but really it shouldn t need to be it s a very fundamental safety point for both adults children staying in the room
