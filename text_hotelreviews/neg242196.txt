the staff were not very welcoming and barley made eye contact had to cary cases up flights of stairs to top floor as there was no lift or help from staff the room itself was ok until we noticed cum stains on one of the cushions yes i m not kidding it was disgusting breakfast room was very small and had to table share to get seated they served up a child portion of an english breakfast tiny sausage slice of bacon egg and a teaspoon of beans not worth waiting for will not be staying again when visiting london
