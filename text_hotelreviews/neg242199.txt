the hotel is supposed to have a hour reception when we arrived at after a late arrival of our flight there was no one on reception it was clear someone was around as the computer was on the bag was there but no one in sight we rung the phone the bell i wandered all through the hotel trying to find somebody eventually almost half an hour later the person who was supposed to be on reception arrived coming down the stairs tucking in his shirt it was clear he must have been having a nap given i had to get up for work at i was less than thrilled additionally the sheets on the pull out bed were very stained to the point that they looked dirty the bathroom doesn t have very good ventilation so starts to smell quite quickly the wifi works infrequently the steps to the rooms are very steep and narrow not ideal when you re carrying heavy suitcases the hotel overall is old worn and creaky
