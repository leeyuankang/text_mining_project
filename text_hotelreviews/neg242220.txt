actually saw a waitress blow crumbs off a side plate and leave it there for another diner not impressed hygeine standards anyone had to wait for breakfast as room is v small tv in room was also broken shower tiny and opened directly to toilet so no room to dry yourself without hitting said toilet this hotel is adequate for an overnight stay but not exactly the height of luxury
