i know this sounds strange but the only thing we didn t like was the shampoo it had a bad smell we had brought our own so it wasn t a real issue and the wardrobe s top shelf isn t flush with the wall so if you drop something down there you can t retrieve it because the wardrobe is built in the hotel is a bit shabby but not to the point of it mattering the polish girls were very nice but you have to be very clear when ordering your breakfast be specific or they will bring you whatever they think you want
