this could be a good place if they got friendlier people on reception when we turned up reception was open we walked into the room and a man was stood there silently with no shoes on took me a minute to work out he was the receptionist and was about to pray ok i thought and left the room for a minute but i do think he could have just closed reception for a few minutes to avoid a slightly bizarre arrival then later on my dad arrived separately he had another booking when he got to his room somebody else s luggage was there in the room the same receptionist at first told my dad to move rooms then said he couldn t because the hotel was full so my dad stayed in the original room the luggage was removed but we were left wondering whether some other people would be joining my dad in the room seeing as they would think their luggage was there all just a bit odd rude and unorganised no apology or any explanation as to why luggage was in somebody s room
