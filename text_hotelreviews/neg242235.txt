for a night not that cheap even if central london i was given a tiny cabin room which was basically a single bed with walls around it no space no comfort nowhere to put a suitcase or even a book possibly larger rooms would have been ok but more expensive again not well insulated at night could feel the cold draft yet found no extra blanket wifi didn t work as advertised
