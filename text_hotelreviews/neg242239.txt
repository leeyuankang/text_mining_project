it was the smallest hotel room i have ever stayed in i could not fit my suitcase in the room the small single bed was the room there was no desk there more or less impossible to climb all the stairs with a suitcase to get to the room i am surprised and disappointed that booking com even has this hotel as a recommended hotel
