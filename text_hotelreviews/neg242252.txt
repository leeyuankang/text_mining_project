i don t know how this hotel is called a four stars hotel there is no car park then there s no elevator the furniture is very old and uncomfortable at all and when it comes to the breakfast it s very cold with no much of choices it was really very bad experience for us especially with our one month baby and when we had to carry him and our luggage to the third floor there are a lot of negative things to talk about but the only thing i m going to say is that i m not going back here again
