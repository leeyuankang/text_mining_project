the rating for this hotel is hugely misleading my room was small and supposed to be a double bed my idea of a double is not two singles pushed together with one higher than the other the mattresses were cheap and uncomfortable the sheets didn t exactly smell fresh the bedside light didn t work light poured into the room from the hallway through large gaps in the door if the hotel was a night then i wouldn t mind so much but is a complete rip off my email of complaint and follow up were duly ignored very unprofessional
