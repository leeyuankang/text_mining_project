the rooms are advertised as having double beds when in fact the bed was a little more than a single bed what in certain terms would be classified as a superior single room there was no room at all around the bed and it would have been impossible for two people to move around the actual pictures of the room and the physical descriptions have no resemblance to the actual room the room was a single room and highly claustrophobic it s mis selling products to unsuspecting customers who trust your word about the facilities you offer the window had a direct view of gower street and it was impossible to open the window due to heavy traffic throughout the night including buses and taxis the shower itself is no bigger than a coffin and i didn t even have a shower the reception staff didn t even bother saying thank you and or asking me how my stay was because he was on the phone when i went down to breakfast and when i came up to leave a grossly exaggerated hotel masquerading as a facility the only consolation was breakfast and the polite staff in the restaurant and kitchen overall don t expect a room with a view
