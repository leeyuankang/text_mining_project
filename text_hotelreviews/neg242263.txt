stayed at this hotel for one night my eurostar was delayed so rescheduled for the following day so needed a hotel room for the night on booking com it rates so i trusted and booked stars i would struggle to give it stars on arrival around one lady on the reception and man very unfriendly people and basically felt i was more of a nuisance wanting to have a room than a guest i asked if they had a double room he just said no this is the only room left a lie i know as rooms available on booking com but offered no discount for single traveler so i thought ok nice attitude then breakfast is only from really especially on a sunday another let down i asked the checkout time and he told me but later when checking my confirmation in my room it says so another lie he told me i really felt uncomfortable and like i was more of a pain to him than a guest customer on arrival to the room it was so small it was unbelievable i had to have my suitcase in front of the door when i was in the room and then put it on the bed so i could leave the room the whole room was just horrible shower moldy and hardly worked and im sure they turn the hot water off after a certain time went to have a shower about and it was just warm to say the least the breakfast is ok in the morning its free so you cant complain overall i would never ever stay at this hotel again unless like this time i was desperate but even then i would rather look for something else and as for the man in reception he should either learn to give good service or find a new job your doing the hotel no favors in guest ratings
