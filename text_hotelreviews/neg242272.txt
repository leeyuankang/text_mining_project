upon arrival someone was smoking in the next room the smell was awful along the corridor the reception dealt with the problem immediately and spoke to the guest breaking the rules the smell took a while to disappear which spoiled things a little for me as i hate the smell of cigarettes however the hotel dealt with the matter swiftly and effectively and for that i m thankful not really the hotels fault that some guests break the rules
