we had a dirty towel sewage smell coming from the toilet which then entered the room we were then moved into single rooms even though we had booked a double the breakfast was disgusting me and my mum came down with sickness and diarrhoea from our stay there tried to get a refund for the first evening and was met by very rude and obnoxious receptionists and the manager is yet to phone me to sort it out as now i would like a complete refund as it ruined our trip for my mum s birthday worst hotel experience of my life
