whilst i appreciate that the hotel was making the most of the space it had i didn t appreciate the awful service at breakfast when the dining room was full we weren t even acknowledged as we stood unsure of where to wait while a table became available there was no good morning no apology for the wait nothing when we finally got a table we were told there was no sausage or mushroom left again there was no apology shockingly poor customer service and the reason that i would not recommend this hotel it certainly wasn t the start i wanted to my birthday
