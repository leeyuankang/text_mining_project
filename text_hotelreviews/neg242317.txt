if you book a single room check that it is not cabin this means that the room is just wider than outstretched arms the mirror in the bathroom is not over the sink but over the toilet i never got the free wifi to work although the sheets appeared to be ok the covering over the bed was stained to charge that price for a room like that is shameful
