everything the room smelt of damp and sewage the decor was dirty and tired the window almost fell out when i tried to close it as the frame was so rotten the net curtains were black with mold the tv was so small it was difficult to see from the bed although breakfast was included i was not going to risk eating in such a disgusting place
