musty smell on arrival everywhere from the entrance to our room on the third floor walls ceilings needed painting dirty carpet dark dingy room dirty shower no matress cover bed matress stained dirty windows and the curtains had seen better days the bedroom carpet was really dirty and there were damp stains on the celing and walls by the windows we didnt feel like stayning at all but it was late and we had an appointment the pictures on booking com looked clean and bright but it was far from it the breakfast foom was very small and we had to wait so long for breakfast on the first morning we went without we did have a light breakfast on the second morning where the very young waitresses were helpful the man on reception on the sunday morning was not interested in my complaints and told us we had to leave by when it clearly said on the booking details when i went to pay he told me he had already taken payment by using my card details i didnt think this was usual as it had never happened before my advice would be to not stay here and its not good enough that people see a different view on the booking site we would have thought there should be inspections done on a regular basis to ensure patrons get a fair deal
