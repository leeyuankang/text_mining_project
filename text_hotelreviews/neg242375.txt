wifi was not good tv remote was not working we reported it but it was not sorted our bedroom window was open when we entered the room my sister went over to look outside and put her hand out to touch the window and there was a sheetrock so she could have fallen out a young child running into the room towards the window would not have been so lucky it was really dangerous we did report it
