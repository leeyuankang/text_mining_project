my error but i forgot to ensure there was a lift we were placed on the third floor six flights of stairs with two pieces of luggage each to pull up the stairs if this does not worry you it is not a problem but for us it was the main disappointment the first staff member who greeted us was very welcoming the other reception guy was not welcoming or helpful our safe was never unlocked as we requested on the first day long walk to station so plan to get cab
