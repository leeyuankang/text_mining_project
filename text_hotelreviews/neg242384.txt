not worth the money of staying here even though the location on a map seems close it is at least a minute walk to anything that is worth seeing or eating there is no elevator and no assistance carrying up luggage the first night the tv froze that morning management said they would switch us to another room to pack our bags and bring them to the lobby when we returned our next room would be available we we returned later that evening our bags were still in the lobby it would have be a decent thing for them to have put our bags in our new room but that didn t happen this room was smaller and on the third night the tv froze again wifi was if y sometimes it would work and others you d have to hold your phone in a particular direction for connection if you are requesting a pull out bed don t it is very uncomfortable if you are going to stay here you might as well book another room so that person doesn t have to sleep on the pull out this place was definitely not worth the stay
