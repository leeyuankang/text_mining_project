refurbishment of hotel is ongoing first room was on ground level and could not be entered due to carpet installation during that day second room we got was on first level and had its window to the ventilation system very noisy staff was unfriendly on departure day they booked us an unofficial cab where the driver had to call his boss to ask for the price i cannot recommend this hotel as you get no value for your cash and we are speaking of a quasi hotel
