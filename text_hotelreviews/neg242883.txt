pot of tea wasn t offered at breakfast until nearly finished eating even though i had to go and ask for one it still didn t arrive for another minutes was offered room at first and i didn t like the fact the bed was pushed up against the wall i could not sleep in that bed i requested for another room and had to wait over an hour for one we originally had to wait for an hour for the first room i would ve thought complimentary drinks would have been offered but they weren t i appreciate there were late check outs and rooms have to be cleaned however complimentary drinks snacks would have made the difference we were sat on sofa opposite the check in desk and although it was busy i felt just an acknowledgement from the reception staff that they remembered we were sat there and giving us the progress of our room being available we were just sat there watching lots of people checking in and going to their rooms we felt like we d been forgotten over hours waiting to get a room was disappointing we were attending the phil collins concert in hyde park and had missed the first hours of it which was disappointing we had travelled from liverpool and had been up since and really didn t want to be hanging around for a room we paid for a room and i felt the first room we were offered room was not value for the money we paid the dressing table in our room room did not have a stool to sit on although there was a chair in the room the bed was in the way and therefore wouldn t fit in front of it the bedside light would not go off at all no matter what switch we used so we had to take it out of the holder to go to sleep it was replaced the following morning i also thought given the money we paid we would ve had slippers and dressing gowns to wear the largest bath towel wasn t that big
