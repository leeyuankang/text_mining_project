i had specified no stairs on my booking form but the room i was given when i arrived was up two steep flights of stairs when i complained i was given another room this room was tiny even by london standards with no room for a bedside table and looked out onto a light well the dark wood and curtains added to its cave like appearance the mattress was lumpy and sloped to one side the bottom sheet was so small that it could not be tucked in the duvet cover was at least six inches too short exposing the bare end of the duvet all in all i expected a lot more from a four star hotel
