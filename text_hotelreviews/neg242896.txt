when we arrived at the hotel we were informed that we would stay in another building from the same group that was in another location they arranged a car to take us there but we had to check in twice and it was confusing on top of that the shower drain was clogged it had water everywhere when used as i only spent one night due to the cancellation of my flight with ba it was not worth asking to change rooms
