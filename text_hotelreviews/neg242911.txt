there was a safety light in our room which did not have a switch to be able to turn it off i can t sleep with a light on so this was a little disruptive they did offer to send someone up to turn it off but i left it as is hair dryer was hard to find it s in the study table instead of the bathroom which makes it a bit inconvenient robes and slippers should have been provided along with bigger towels walls are thin and windows are not sound proof so you can hear sirens and traffic noise from the rooms facing the street
