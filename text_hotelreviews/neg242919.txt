the room size was rather that of a mouse hole for a room named deluxe this was very disappointing service was not really satisfactory no power adapter available at the reception and if it was defective i heard several guests with that problem hair dryer was hidden in the desk drawer so one could dry one s hair but without a mirror next time in london i will try another hotel can t recommend it to nobody
