paid extra for a club deluxe double which to be honest was a waste of money the only difference we could see between this and a normal double which one of our party had was a little more space and a mezzanine level with a lounge area and small kitchenette which was a nice touch but unnecessary for just the one night also very disappointed that there was no bath in the bathroom came back from theatre around and needed a snack before bed there was no room service offered and no food available after had to settle for the fruit and biscuits in the room instead o k but not ideal breakfast system was awful travelled as part of a very small group we gave our room numbers to the breakfast manager expecting to be seated straight away only to be told we would need to wait in the bar area until seating was available this we did for when the breakfast manager came to get us he said there was room for of us only we complained and then a couple of minutes later were told we could all sit together when we got into the breakfast room it was practically empty so what the problem was who knows thought it was very expensive for what it was it was o k but isn t really boutique just an average hotel
