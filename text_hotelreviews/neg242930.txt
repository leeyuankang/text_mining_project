a man walked into my room without knocking as i was getting changed he then wanted to climb out my bedroom window this is acceptable even with the hotel saying the man was sorting ac out but surely shouldn t just be allowed to walk into someone s room without knocking or even asking told the hotel front desk and they didn t do anything about it my window didn t close correctly and front desk said they would sort the problem which wasn t done the view was a white walk which online doesn t state that we was in the basement the breakfast is a nightmare there was of us travelling together and turns out when bust your not allowed to sit together unless you kick up and make it known your not happy staff do not know or understand customer service they smile when your telling them your not happy with something or someone felt my complain wasn t dealt with definitely not worth the money we not be staying again
