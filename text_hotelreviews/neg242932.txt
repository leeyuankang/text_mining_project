i didn t enjoy the stay if i m honest the shower wouldn t drain so i took the plug up which was full of hairs wee stains on the toilet seat the bed wasn t comfy you were constantly dipped into one side of the bed the floor has floorboard missing you could feel them whilst you were walking around the room a water stain on the ceiling from previous water leaks the iron didn t work well you put water into the iron and it came straight out at the bottom the location of our room wasn t the best the door on the stairs kept me awake and the view looking into a small roof a yard it was my anniversary break away and it wasn t the best
