the room carpets were filled with an inch layer of dust and never cleaned in ages we noticed that the room service cleaners do not use vacuum cleaners to clean the rooms the entire family got ill due to dust allergy and creaking windows we had to move out of hotel days prior to departure as it was unbearable we changed rooms after the nights but it seems all rooms had similar issues also they are bunch of cheats as they promised to refund nights s payment since we cancelled the last nights and asked for a confirmation from booking com this was provided by email still they did not refund the payment overall our holiday was a big disaster due to choosing the wrong hotel
