the deluxe double rooms are actually the cheapest ones and are very small these are definitely only deluxe by name we requested to be moved to another room as the bed in the room that was first given to us was really narrow a lot smaller than a standard double bed perhaps or wide but the above was nothing as compared to the complete lack of sound insulation within the walls we were unfortunate to end up in a room next to noisy customers and it felt more or less the same as being in the same room so we were able to share all their discussions and activities if you see what i mean that could have actually been a bit funny as i am not really fussy but on that occasion it wasn t and i did not sleep at all that night
