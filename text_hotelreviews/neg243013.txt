no lift for access to rooms at the back of the hotel however the hotel do offer porter service to help carry the luggage through the winding steps the initial check in was rather unpleasant as they told me that there was some admin issue they will transfer me to a sistel hotel nearby i was happy at first as they offer to book a cab free of charge to bring me to the sister hotel when i reach the hotel it was a distance away from paddingtin station and it was still undergoing some renovation upon seeing this i requested to go back to this hotel which i had booked initially base on its proximity to paddington station without much fuss the staff at the sister hotel again book a cab to transfer me back to this hotel the staff in this hotel was fast to find a room for me and offer to provide free breakfast for my day stay though it was a happy ending i am still puzzled as to why they are able to find me a room when initially they said there was no room for me due to some admin issue with the booking
