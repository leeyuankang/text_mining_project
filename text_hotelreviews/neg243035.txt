my room was expensive at night but given the hotel is supposedly a i thought it seemed reasonable however even though i was upgraded to a suite room the hotel was dirty decoration tired the angle of the tv in my bedroom meant i couldn t watch it the maid knocked multiple times before i checked out when i wasn t ready with no do not disturb sign available this hotel it not quality at least decorate re carpet and keep them clean really a renovation is needed here it s not worth the price i paid by a long way
