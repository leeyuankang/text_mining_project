when i booked the room it was described as having a double and a single bed i booked this to have extra room but the room we got only had a double bed i could have booked a similar room elsewhere for a third less than what i paid and also the full price for the rooms changed daily so whereas i thought it was a great deal the next day it was half the reduced price i paid and left me feeling more than a little peeved there were no robes and the air conditioning didn t work so overall was not happy paying such a high price for a standard room with no frills
