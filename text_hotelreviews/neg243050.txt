from the pictures when i booked i thought my room was going to be different better i think i could have given harry potter s cupboard under the stairs a run and had more space not a problem really just an observation what was a problem was the mattress presumably because of the size of the room people sit on the side of the bed this has damaged the mattress to the point where turning it would not even help
