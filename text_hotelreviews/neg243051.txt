it says that its no deposit when booking the hotel however they hold the first nights funds out of your account prior to your arrival i wasn t happy about this as i had booked three rooms for family and had the money held out of my account for all three rooms even though it is made out that you pay on arrival when i rang the hotel to find out why they had attempted to take the amount out three times i only knew because my bank had cancelled the transactions and froze my account believing it was fraudulent activity the woman i spoke told me it was standard procedure for all hotels i have never had this happen to me before when booking hotels then she pointed out it was in smaller font at the very bottom of the page when i said this should really be made more clear she said i will pass the message on to the manager as your not the first to question the procedure surely if its a problem you have been made aware of in the past you would sort it the bar area is really small and has one sofa then the most uncomfortable chairs imaginable no draught was available asked for a large wine only had small wine glasses so that was another no the room was basic very small but ok for a city break where you aren t in the room much our stay was ok and in a nice area but we won t be returning to this hotel on our next trip
