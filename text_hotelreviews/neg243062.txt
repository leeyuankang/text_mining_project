room was a let down tbh dated poor view window looked like its never been cleaned worn upholstery i must say bathroom was nice though one of our two rooms actually smelt of sweaty feet i was given a tin of air freshener to combat this shower would suddenly go hot enough to make my year old cry worst of all my daughter drank tap water from the glasses provided and the water after it settled looked like sewage water we was also woken by a fire alarm on more than one occasion defiantly not a star people go on its london etc i have stayed in better travel lodge rooms i hate writing these reviews especially as staff where excellent but for two nights no breakfast etc is a lot for what we feel is star accommodation this app also needs more space for photos
