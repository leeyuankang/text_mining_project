the room and facilities were ok but in terms of cleanliness the hotel is ridiculously below par spillages down the radiator curtains were in need of a clean and generally quite shabby looking the worst part being the bodily hair in the bed and over the pillows in spite of asking to change rooms and another being offered it was still the same they actually did offer to deep clean the room whilst we waited and even after this the beds were still disgusting if they can t even ensure the cleanliness of the bed you sleep in then i m not sure i d ever go back we stayed a total of around hours and then were offered a refund to go elsewhere not exactly an ideal way to start your holiday when you have to book another hotel from the one you are in on the plus side the hilton was beautiful
