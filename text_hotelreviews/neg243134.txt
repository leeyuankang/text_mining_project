can i start off by saying i am not your typical complainer in fact more the type to defend bad criticism if not worthy of the comments however this hotel and its facilities are not a patch on the basic premier inns and travelodge s so here goes the room was not what we had booked we booked a double club room and what we got was a tiny room that was only fit for a single bed to find that there was two single beds and a put me up that you could not get around the put me up was up against the fridge and would have required moving to get to the fridge and tea making facilities the receptionist was well trained and versed and when we complained advised us that that was all they had until the following night we asked to be refunded but were advised that they do not refund only when i explained that we had contracted for and paid for a double club room and this was not and that i was going to write to the managing director of the hotel chain that out of the blue a double club room appeared with a complimentary bottle of prosecco the bathroom in the first room had no standing room at the sink because the toilet was in the way or visa versa the staff albeit somewhat embarrassed were actually quite nice and very apologetic they do need a new toaster downstairs in the restaurant however and for those travellers wishing to use this hotel be aware that the rooms are very small unless you go club the restaurant is very small and providing everyone does not want breakfast at the same time then it may be ok i stop in hotels most weeks this is definitely not a star hotel at best a star
