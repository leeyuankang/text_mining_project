london must rate the stars in a different way the room was never a four stars hotel s worth maximum a two stars hotel the furniture was old and well used the room narrow and crooked there was no hair dryer in the bathroom or room and there was a really bad smell in the reception the bed wasn t the best either i would give this hotel star for the room stars for the bathroom i found the hotel too expensive for this kind of room
