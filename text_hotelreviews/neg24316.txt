reception staff are not the friendliest and helpful on the last night we had to sleep in birmingham we asked if we could get a refund which was not possible we then arrived just before at the hotel the day after to ask if we could atleast get an extra hour just to freshen up before we left which they would not allow considering we didnt sleep there the night before and didnt get a refund this was the least i thought they could have done
