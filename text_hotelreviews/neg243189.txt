the room we were given was a tiny basement room after being told they wanted to move us to another hotel we were on a trip with our daughter and her family so did not want to be in a different hotel even with an upgrade breakfast was not a very good experience the dining room is small the tables too close together and we had to wait mins to be seated and then the six of us were placed on three different tables the food was ok though
