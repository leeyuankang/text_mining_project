the staff tried to place me in a sister hotel the location of which i never actually discovered because of essential maintenance when i insisted on staying at the hotel i had booked and suggested that if they had overbooked their rooms they should bump someone else they quickly found a room for me but then they tried to make me pay for the room that had already been paid for again and refused to let me check in and give me a key until i did when i explained that i could not pay if i could have i would have and sorted out any overcharge later as i had traveled with only enough cash to buy food and drink for the day and no credit or debit card they still refused carrying little money when travelling in my own country for a single nights stay is something i do nowadays when attending crowded events concerts gigs where i expect to be at or near the front because of having lost cards wallets and a watch in my time over years i explained again and again that i would have to sleep rough on the streets of london if they did not give me the room as booked because i had no means to pay them or anywhere else for a room to which they responded that they would get the money anyway when i asked what would happen to the room in that case they said it would remain empty to which i suggested that they should let me check in then and i assured them again that if they were correct and the room had not been paid for that i would see to it that it was eventually after emailing a friend of mine a form for payment but before any further payment was made they gave in and allowed me to check in and showed me to a room the single room was ridiculously small i was not expecting much room to be fair but the phrase about swinging a cat comes to mind and to be honest there was not even enough room for a cat
