definitely not a hotel breakfast was so disorganised and no one paid attention to refill drink dispensers food etc room was disappointing due to the noise could hear the rooms on the same floor and lights not workingproperly although the first room we were given was someone else s room containing their luggage etc overall i don t think we would stay again
