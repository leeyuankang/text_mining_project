the breakfast was very average one of us is a coeliac who usually has fruit and yoghurt but the fruit on offer was tasteless unripe melon and tough tinned peaches pretty inedible if we had been paying the big bucks breakfast cost we would have been really upset the other of us had very average cereal followed by bacon and poor pallid eggs not worth the charge at all service was good but what is the use of poor service when the food is bad the indian restaurant s offerings were not gluten free although most authentic curries never contain gluten so we were very disappointed that we had to go out to eat
