the property is listed as westminster and although it is in the westminster burrough it is actually located in bayswater with the nearest tube station being paddington it would be helpful if they were clearer with the location the rooms were a little noisy my door was difficult to close to had to be slammed shut rather loudly and squeaky boards from the room above were disturbing also
