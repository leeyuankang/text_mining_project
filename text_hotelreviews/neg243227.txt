i realize that the staff never smiles which was kept allover my stay the hotel did not care about my recommendation in online booking when i asked for a hard pillow the room was very small but well arranged it got unpleasant decoration including the carpets and the wall color the ac was not working but thanks god london was work at this time the window was leaking air with another unpleasant view the corridor was ancient and smelly amenities were basic but enough the bathroom was small but well arranged the towels were smelly sleeping was ok the staffs were helpful when asking but never smile when facing customers also did not look overloaded the hotel did not contain any facilities and i wonder how it got stars check out was express and it was the best thing happened during my stay in summary i won t be staying again
