when we arrived in our room we were shocked at the size we had booked a deluxe double however it was more like a small double the bed was comfy however a small double bed there was no real room to move about the room was also not as clean as we would expect there was a few stains here and there when checking out the staff members were not so friendly not even a thank you or goodbye we would not stay here again due to the small rooms
