the room smelt a little but musty on entering the room but wasn t unbearable the bathroom was tiny could hardly turn without touching the walls felt claustrophobic if you re in there a long time the most annoying incident was whenever we returned from going out the fuse would trip in the room and there was no power we had to call staff up everytime to come and fix it
