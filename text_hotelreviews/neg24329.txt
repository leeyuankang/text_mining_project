the staff were not helpful at one point i called the reception to inquire why my fridge was locked she answered its because i didnt pay pounds deposit i replyed no one asked me to pay and honestly i only wanted to use it to store groceries that i have just purchase her answer is she will have to send a request to clear my fridge which should take untill tomorrow i guess buying a new fridge should take less time
