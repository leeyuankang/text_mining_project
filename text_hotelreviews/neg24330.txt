the worst thing is the rooms we got were like cells or sealed rooms there were windows but basically next to a wall we felt very uncomfortable i think this should be mentioned in the room specifications on the website so customers can have a choice if they would like to pay more for a room with open view besides the front desk staff were not really helpful we travelled in a group of and of us got a room on a different floor booking was made well in advance and they could have made necessary arrangement for the group to stay on the same floor but not putting the blame on us for checking in late which was out of our control plus we did mention this on our booking it is something small and it s fine if they could not make a change but their attitude was poor and they didn t seem to care and show sincerity
