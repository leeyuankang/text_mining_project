i didnt think the hotel was worthy of its star rating as the rooms were small and not nice very dark and obviously been designered beyond need without understanding a guest only focussing on the dark felt headboard design the carpets were not so clean glasses were dirty and i had to call for fresh ones the shower room partition was nice in appearance but putting a toilet roll on the side of the bath fixing meant it became wet when the shower was used the mirrors steamed up fully and rendered them useless there was no guest slippers and i was pleased i brought my own face cloths it was evident that the hotel had focussed on appearance but not functionality having a full size ironing board in the long drop wardrobe section wasn t useful at all and the cut backs on guest facilities was in the wrong places tea and sugars literally stuffed in a tin on the side was very poor no valance on the bed showing the bad base was very poor the concierge was unable to give clear directions to the location and we were driving around to find parking which i understood was in the hotel but we found out was in another hotel over the main road a few hundred meters away the breakfast room s light but again very modernised and designered to look something its not really a prime example of fur coating something that s not covering its bare essentials first i could go on but really its not worth it as the hotel has fudged its star rating and i was extremely disappointed i will revert back to my previous hotel nearby for future bookings the lancaster is much better and has some quality in its tradition
