a small stuffy room which didn t match the description deluxe or the price in our opinion to get to the bed required a sideways shuffle between the end of the beds and the desk there wasn t room to have the chair at the desk and you couldn t open the mini bar because the door was blocked by the bed the room didn t match the website photographs which show a suitable gap at the end of the bed we paid to have an extra person in the room but there wasn t an extra set of towels extra coffee etc there was one biscuit packet and one chocolate bar between of us which seemed a bit mean especially for a deluxe room luckily we were able to settle who had what amicably we weren t inclined to use the bar lounge so cannot comment on the quality of these areas the receptionist was efficient but unsympathetic her advise was to ask for a larger room on booking not something we would have thought necessary beforehand and we won t be booking again
