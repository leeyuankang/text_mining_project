its generally a good hotel but i think could be better i just have some feedback and suggestions would be nice to have water bottles provided with tea and coffee facilities cleaning staff do not always replace tea bags and toiletories some international tv satellite channels would be nice and specifically for kids like cartoon network hotel blocked night pay days before arrival and i have free cancellation up to hours before arrival and payment details were pay on arrival i did not like that
