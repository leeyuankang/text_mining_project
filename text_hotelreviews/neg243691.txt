the rooms are quite small and with a baby cot it becomes hard to move around compare the room bathroom is big i would rather room to be bigger and a small shower the staff didnt seem to know much about whats going on one night in middle of night the fire alarm went on our baby woke up and she was very scared and crying they made no explanation until i called up and asked and they just said sorry something has gone wrong in the kitchen it was a false alarm around the hotel is very loud there is a pub opposite the hotel and the noise comes from street is quite loud it can wake you up and i am usually not bothered about noise when we entered into room there was a portable air condition working on apart from the one installed on the wall the pipe was going through the window and you need to take the pipe in to be able to close the window we asked this to be removed and asked why they put this into the room they said in hot weathers when everyone is using the air condition air condition is not working well but that makes no sense as the portable one was working only when the window was open also as the room is already small that was taking a space there were no fridge in the room this are the ones it comes into my mind however it was clean and safe enough to stay with a child i would not stay again though
