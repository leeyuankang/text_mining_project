there wasn t enough room to open the bathroom door and it banged against the bedside cupboard all the time there were many marks and dents on the door and this made the glass top slide towards the bed we booked two double rooms but there was one extra bed in one room and two extra beds in the other so not really what we booked if you wanted a family room then they would be good value but were of no value to us they were supposed to be upgrades but didn t have that feel one room was in the basement with frosted windows and the corridor smelt musty like there may have been a flood in the past the rooms were a little tired looking
