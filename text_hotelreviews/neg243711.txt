the staff were very rude and did not want to take responsibility for a mistake on their part when i wanted to extend a booking the counter staff claimed that i did not inform him them and sign any papers even though they specifically told me to leave everything in his hands when i asked for an extension we had to pay pounds for a small double room in the end because of his mistake service is so bad that the cost seems too high another thing is when i informed them my bedsheets had blood stain they said it s because they only change the sheets every alternate day which means we have been sharing the sheets with the previous guests unacceptable
