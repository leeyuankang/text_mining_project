it would have been nice if we could have even sat on the toilet let alone swing a cat in bathroom very small bedrooms we had mice running around and when we complained and asked for refund we were given our deposit back and the first mornings breakfast free no sign of manager which we all agreed was diabolical after spending close to on this very poor hotel so we shall be in touch with the authorities who handle these situations staff very polite and helpful
