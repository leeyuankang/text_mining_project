this is the most expensive room we have ever booked it was a special treat as my husband has been working in england for months and i live in fuerteventura so we met up in london and we were very disappointed as the room was so small no room to move once our bags were in the room nothing like the photos extremely loud you can hear everything from the other rooms people coming and going all night long the staff should spend the night in the room to realise how loud it is in there nothing special at all in the rooms not even many toiletries a lot of money wasted as we were so looking forward to these few days together before he went off to his next job
