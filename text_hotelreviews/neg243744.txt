room was a tiny box inside hotel such that view from the very small window was of an internal ventilation shaft as i was on business i only spent hours in the room to sleep but even then i couldn t open my luggage case and walk around very disappointed considering the price of the room but i m sure i ll be told that this is the standard in london having said tha the room was spotless and very comfortable
