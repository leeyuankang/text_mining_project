in room the heating system was not working and the receptionist suggested bringing in a portable heater of course i asked them to change the room which they did only after i insisted a lot i checked in at about pm and we moved at pm in the meantime we had to endure the cold in the room not to mention the fact that room is very small and i am not convinced even now that it was a deluxe room with two twin bes which i had paid for i cannot explain to myself why the lady at the recepiton did not want to move us to another room there were obviouy other rooms available as it turned out in the end no slippers or gowns provided so take care and bring some from home
