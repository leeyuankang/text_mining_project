poor check in experience had to wait mins to check in at as only person manning the checkin desk and was dealing badly with an incorrect booking there was another person just standing around but when i asked if he could help he said he couldn t see photo when i finally got seen to i expressed my dissatisfaction in having to wait for in my opinion an unacceptable time and asked to speak to the manager i was told i couldn t so i then asked for a discount due to having to wait for so long that at least got the receptionist to call the manager the desired result the manager was not on the premises so the receptionist called them i was expecting to speak to the manager but after a very quick call he put the phone down and said that she had said no to the discount i tried to explain that it was not the discount per se i wanted to speak to them about it was the unacceptable waiting time at that time of night i asked him to call her back but he refused saying that she did not want to talk to me i asked for the name of the manager and was told their first name only lakshmi the receptionist claimed not to know their last name seriously so all in all a very bad experience at this hotel especially after a long day at work where all i wanted to was go to bed as had to be up early the next day
