we woke in the morning to find there was a leak over the desk and my clothes that i had put there for the next day were soaked the leak came from the light fixture unbelievable to make it worse they have a hairdryer plugged in and put in the drawer i used it the night before and left it on the desk the water from the leak went into that so if i had of turned that on to dry my clothes that were soaked i would have been electrocuted also the night before we ordered water to our room the guy at the desk possibly night manager kept cutting us off when we were talking and not listening we waited an hour no water was brought up we called them and they told us we gave the wrong room number and they woke up because of us so rude i can assure you we said our room correctly the woman at the desk next morning was the the only nice one there that we dealt with she said that our water was complimentary because of the leak and she would have the manager call
