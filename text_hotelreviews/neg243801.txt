the double deluxe room was very cramped and not much space to move around in we took the elevator to the first floor were our room initially was and had to drag our luggages through the corridors and endless staircases to get to our room staff could have informed us there was an easier way to our room instead of using the elevators which made it more difficult bedroom was quite dusty and not vacuumed housekeeping didn t bother changing the bedsheets so we had to request them to do it
