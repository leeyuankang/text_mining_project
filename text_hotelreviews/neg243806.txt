small room but this is standard for london i am not overweight but it was not easy to get in and out of the tiny shower bed mattress too soft for me free mobile phone in room but it kept lighting up and i put it under the bedside table lighting kept dimming spotlights over bed breakfast pricey went elsewhere was in basement room narrow corridors make it difficult with luggage worst thing is walls are like cardboard you can hear everything would not stay again at this price did not think it was star standard shower needed cleaning around door seal otherwise clean i would personally rather have free breakfast than use of mobile phone tv
