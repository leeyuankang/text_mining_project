staff were miserable rude and unhelpful terrible check in experience booked deluxe doubles all rooms varied in size and facilities our room was so uncomfortably small we couldn t walk round the bed or even open the wardrobe and we had a plug in electric heater and this cost a night there was no bar or restaurant even though this is advertised on the website we were told to eat at the pub across the road the restaurant was only open for breakfast which was and was stone cold this hotel is shockingly poor and no where near a rating basicly a poor star b b guest house the only thing good about this hotel is the decor and cleanliness would never return and certainly would not recommend
