the room is already hot enough without the a c we were fine even as a mediterranean but if you feel colder than a normal person the air coming from the a c was cold in the both rooms and it works so loud breakfast we paid for the breakfast but regret that we already paid there are other restaurants and cafes just near the hotel you can have a better breakfast at a cheaper price
