firstly i didn t like finding a mouse living in my room and when i complained about this were told there was other room available until i told them that was unacceptable we were moved rooms but obviously didn t feel comfortable anymore day of check out we noticed that we had been double charged for the room which we complained about yet again we were told we were wrong until we persisted into them looking further when they discovered they were in the wrong no apologie would never stay here again
