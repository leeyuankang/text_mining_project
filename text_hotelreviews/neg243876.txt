i booked a twin deluxe room and when i arrived for the check in the receptionist has told me that they don t have any available room and they were sorry so they offered me another room in a different location i re checked booking com and found available rooms so i insisted on staying in the same hotel later on they found me a twin room in the basement that is not as big and spacious as shown in pictures i complained over what happened to booking com and i explained how i ended up in a very small basement room but the hotel told booking that all their rooms are deluxe with the same standard anyway they changed my room after two nights to a higher floor room as small as the basement one try contacting the hotel before you arrive to avoid being sent to a different location
