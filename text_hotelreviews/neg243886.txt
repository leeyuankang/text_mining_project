the financial policies of the hotel require review and while the staff are pleasant they are largely undertrained i paid on arrival for a day stay but found a day later that a second charge for a large sum i did not recognise was pending on my card in addition to the sum already fully paid for my accomodation staff initially tried to tell me that this was standard however the second charge was inexplicable rectifying the matter required my persisting in three conversations with ineffectual staff who gave me the impression that they did not know what they were doing and did not pass on messages to management requiring me to explain my concerns again and again frankly being told i don t know is not a suitable answer to a query regarding why over has been added to your credit card bill the extra charge was eventually removed three days after i had left the hotel with my funds tied up until it was rectified not impressed when i returned a week later for a single night booking prior to departure from the uk on a long haul flight i noted that the room fee was preauthorised on my card hours before my stay which is not a problem yet when i arrived tired and ready for my room at no room was available which is a problem and quite unacceptable without prior notification after i refused a transfer to another property i needed the proximity to paddington and the heathrow express another room was found and the matter eventually rectified to my satisfaction again management had to be called to sort it out with reception polite but essentially useless had i not refused to move elsewhere i have no doubt i would have been palmed off and had a difficult morning the following day i travel a great deal for business used to work in a world class hospitality facility myself don t expect the world and don t complain lightly
