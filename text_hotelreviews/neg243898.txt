the room was so tiny and this was after being upgraded on arrival to a club room which apparently was bigger i dread to think how small the double room would have been which we booked but presumably a lot smaller than the photos indicate also the room felt a hundred degrees when we arrived would have been nice if the aircon was left on for us to turn off ourselves also the tv was by far the worst i ve ever encountered in any hotel it only had about or viewable channels and none of the remote s buttons worked plus the clock on the side of the tv was about hours ahead of time this all would have really annoyed us if we were staying for more than night
