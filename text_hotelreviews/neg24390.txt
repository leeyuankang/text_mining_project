we made our reservation at booking com we did not take a prepaid rate so that we could have flexibility and had full cancellation we were booked for an day stay because the room was so small we changed our plans and decided to check out after a few days the hotel charged us an extra gbp fee to check out this fee was not mentioned in the booking com terms and conditions we were surprised as we have never paid at other hotels to check out earlier we were fine to pay for the days we stayed but felt the extra fee was no outlined anywhere and was unfair we should pay only for the days we stayed
