unprofessional and poor service they told us that there is maintenance so we went to their other hotel in paddington and were told for sure the next day we will be back to hotel we bocked the next day were told that it will take one more day to get to hotel we bocked also they give us small room and small beds which was different than the one we booked it is like they decide which hotel and also the room you stay in and expect you to pay it does not deserve more than stars
