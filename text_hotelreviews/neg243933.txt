the room was small and hot air con would not go below reported it but nothing done the breakfast was very disorganized and you would expect it to be busy on a sunday morning so cater accordingly but food was coming out a little bit at a time not everything was available i waited min for my breakfast and eventually gave up we paid for two nights breakfast not included but i would not call the room a delux room
