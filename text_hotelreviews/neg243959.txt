we were given a room in the basement and had a bright green light in the ceiling which was on all night on asking the staff what the light was and could it be turned off i was told that it was emergency lighting and had to remain on if you have young children and need a night light this room may have been ok for you but for us it just resulted in us getying very little sleep as the room was bathed in light all night long as a result of this we would not consider staying at this hotel again
