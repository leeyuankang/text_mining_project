main points on the arrival the hotel staff told that the hotel is fully booked and they will find me a room in other hotel but after i refused they give me a room i think i read also this comment in the review on the second night i found mouse in the room the hotel apologiesd for that and they gave me another room it seems to me that it wasn t time it happened the room is very small it was difficult to move between bed and bags
