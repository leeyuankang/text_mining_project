tiny room not worth the money and not a standard room couldn t hang clothes in the wardrobe because the ironing board was inside and blocking the rail room too small to put the ironing board if i took it out room was in the basement very noisy window looked out onto the corridor meaning the curtains had to be kept drawn at all times dark room lights need to be on at all times very disappointing overall
