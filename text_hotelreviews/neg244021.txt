the bed and pillows were so hard i had a sniff neck after night and we had to ask for soft pillows because of this the bed was so hard that after a few nights of sleeping in them we have back ache for several days after with my partner having severe back pain the shower cubicle was very small and only a slim person could comfortably stand in and it also leaked on to the floor despite the doors being closed so the floor because very wet the bed was a standard double despite our room being upgraded from a standard double to a club suite further more we were woken up every morning at onwards and could not get to sleep earlier that midnight due to constant noise of trampling and doors slamming above and around us so much that our room rattled when i advised the staff upon checkout of our experience they didn t offer a refund and have lacked compassion and professionalism by consistently not calling me back or calling to discuss the matter further when an specific time and day had been agreed for them to call me i am still waiting for a call i will not choose to book this hotel or other hotels by the same company again as they have been less than helpful and very reluctant to make contact with me now they have been paid my money in advance absolutely disgusted
