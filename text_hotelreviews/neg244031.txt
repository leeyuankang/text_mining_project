i have stayed twice at this hotel first room we had we didn t hear no noice and it was silent but this time around where the room was positioned it was just constant noice and door slamming if we stay again i will not be staying in that room as the noice level is just to high for me they also only have a small option of food and drinks to order to your room this is such a shame and drives people to go out of the hotel just for snacks pain in ass
