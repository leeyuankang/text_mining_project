the staff attempted to transfer me to a sister hotel in paddington on arrival but i explained i had booked this hotel for the location as it was walking distance to where i needed to be the next morning they immediately changed their request and i was allowed to stay at the hotel selected since it didn t appear to be anywhere near full i have no idea why they made the request continental breakfast for seemed a bit expensive so didn t have it
