reception staff weren t overly friendly tv didn t work room was tiny the smallest hotel room i ve ever seen not close to hyde park tiny window in room with view of brick walls very little natural light lights didn t work noisy throughout the night sunday night very small corridors felt cramped charge for breakfast is excessive i wouldn t stay here again you d get a lot more for your money staying in a holiday inn or similar chain hotel
