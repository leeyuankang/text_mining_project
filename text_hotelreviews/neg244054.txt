when i arrived the window was open despite it being a ground floor room and one of the coldest days of the year it took ages to get the room to a decent temperature the room itself was so small that the bathroom door wouldn t open properly because of the bed being in the way due to a family emergency concerning my elderly parents i was forced to leave at so was unable to stay the night i explained the situation to the receptionist and asked that the card authorisation to be held against any extras she was flustered and told me that she was unable to check me out at short notice as she was a trainee and so despite my obvious distress i was forced to wait for the other receptionist to become available when he finally was i explained the situation again and he told me quite flatly that he was unable to refund me my room charge which i hadn t even asked for and hadn t expected not impressed
