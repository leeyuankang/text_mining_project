we booked rooms double single the size of room was very small the single room non expected the breakfast is normal as we have to pay for it per person i expected it to be i better level and with more choices by the way the limited provided items were fresh clean and delicious but still not deserve to pay more to have it better to buy from outside with cheaper price
