lack of information at the receptionist which took time to find the name and reservation although i gave her copy of the reservation but he didn t look on and thank god that i found other copy to save breakfast money although i made my reservation months ahead i fund that the room rate on the same date reservation cheaper nd if you buy voucher for break fast at reception on arrival breakfast cost is pound only what a hell of policy
