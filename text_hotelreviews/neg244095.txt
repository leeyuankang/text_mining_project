the first room i was put in smelt strongly of smoke despite being a no smoking room i m asthmatic so i can t sleep in rooms with strong smells such as smoke the rooms were small and extremely dingy the finish on the room was poor with wallpaper peeling in the corners and fittings being quite old and worn the downstairs lobby area was also a bit shabby
