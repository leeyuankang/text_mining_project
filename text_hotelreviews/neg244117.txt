on arrival told i would need to transfer to another hotel mins walk away although they had texted an hour before i had not received the alert and would still have had to check in to original hotel in any case on complaining they did manage to arrange a room for me at original location i had seen this on their reviews previously but hoped it was a one off i suspect this is regular practice for them as the couple checking in ahead of me were told the same at the time of booking they surely were aware whether they could accommodate you or not and if not it is then that they should offer an alternative
