my first experience in that hotel was not so pleasant the receptionist didn t accept my visa electron it is a hotel policy sir although this wasn t mentioned either on the hotel web site booking com or at the front desk after i had to spent minutes searching atm to pay cash the receptionist told me that deposit per night is required in order to cover unexpected expenses e g mini bar and etc forgot to tell no mini bar available in room and guess what you can pay them with your credit card sir these are the facts make your own conclusions
