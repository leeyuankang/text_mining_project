the entire experience with this hotel was horrible for a number of reasons the rooms shown in the pictures don t exist in the hotel the rooms in the hotel are extremely small an unkempt the restrooms in the room had literally no space and did not have hot water running the hotel isn t maintained well at all as its very unpleasant in the hallways and the staff was pretty bad at handling guests we had other guests before us having big problem with something or the other in the hotel and instead of atleast being cordial they were being extremely rude probably because it was the peak season and the place being located in central london will never be out of guests i highly encourage not even thinking of staying at this place
