i was moved to this hotel on checking into my original hotel receptionist informed me that because of the change i was going to get breakfast inc when i went to the room i had been allocated it was very small in comparison to my original room i had booked i was disappointed and told staff who informed me that it was the only room available but i could check with her again in the morning breakfast was ok but a very small area to move around in think i was probably overcharged as well
