my bag was stolen from the hotel lobby and that speaks a lot on poor management and lack of security it took the hotel half an hour to view the cctv footage and i think the response from the management was atrocious i lost a lot of money and as a traveler it was a nightmare to be in an alien city without any help from the management the management did not even apologies for what has happened i would advise booking com to withdraw the hotel from their system and also advise travellers to not to stay at this hotel imagine a bag being stolen from the lobby of the hotel very poor attitude and shockingly unbelievable behaviour
