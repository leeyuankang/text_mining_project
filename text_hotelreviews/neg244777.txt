the staff at the reception was very un co operative i made a booking with a child under years old inspite of that he insisted that for safety rules of the hotel i had to upgrade my room to simply allow my child to stay no other hotel during my stay made such an absurd comment also the kitchen was closed and the included breakfast was a la carte and not with options it was more like bread and juice only choose this hotel for location not for anything else
