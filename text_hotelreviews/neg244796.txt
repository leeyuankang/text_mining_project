staff upon arrival was not helpful at all as the room i booked was from adults but they provided me with double room in addition to child bed i had to argue hard with the staff as he confirmed that this is the standard room and no body complained about the size of the bed before by calling his manager the manger instructed him to give additional single room until next day the manager when he came and checked the bed he confirmed that this was not the proper bed and he instructed his team to replace it with bigger one this issue took long time until resolved specially i had short time visit to paris and it spoiled my schedule seams expensive compared with other hotels internet was slow
