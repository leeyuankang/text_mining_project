poor hotel poor staff poor concierge especially one named lenard poor hotel manager i waited for check in for more an hour the hotel is old rooms are not up to standard no business center misleading of the view they showed two chairs large balcony but the reality that there is no space for more than one chair the balcony itself is only a space of one chair i think i won t stay in this hotel forever
