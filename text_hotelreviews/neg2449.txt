i booked a deluxe room a couple with months infant and noted my late check in by calling the hotel upon arrival no one helped us with the babystroller and our bags receptionist was looking and waiting we have been given a room that is just a door and you directly must hop on the bed i doubt if it is suitable for human being though we have an infant and i ve been told ooh ok that was our last room sleep and squeeze your baby and tomorrow we give you another one in that room no refrigerator to keep my baby s milk and food i guess that is illegal and no one cares there is no shampoos no soap nothing at all a blocked sink next day another room and offered me a breakfast to please us after i spent the night sleeping under the bed to give a space to my child i just had a look at the breakfast sorry this is not something to offer i moved away immediatly the hotel is outdated and rubbish they took extra booking price compred to the one i see on booking with a difference of usd
