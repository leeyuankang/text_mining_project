two days of room cleaning were missed of a night stay resulting in my having to call reception and ask for the job to be completed there was a shortage of toilet paper on day a rep came up to give me a half a roll as he couldn t find any more he was obviously embarrassed but did eventually came back sometime later with a complete roll one of the bathroom sink drains was blocked i had to request it be fixed it did get fixed there are areas that could afford repair the back patio has loose wooden tiles that should be fixed there is an accident waiting to happen clearly some of the furniture is old and needs replacing or fixing the clothes drying rack in the washroom wasn t working and the staff said they weren t going to fix it the room was very small little space for people to put their clothes so we left them in the suitcase overall the breakfast was good but the veggies were not fresh some of the channels were not working cnn for example i reported the problem twice and nothing was done about it staff was nice but i think they are stretched i don t blame them rather i put the responsibility on the management of holiday inn your star hotel rates a at best we were hoping for more
