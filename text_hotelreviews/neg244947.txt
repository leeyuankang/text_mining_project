absurdly overpriced the normal price of the hotel is about euros most of time but booking com charged us euros per night which is totally absurd when we were booking the hotel we did not know the fair price of the hotel and the reception at the moment did not remind us either if we go to the reception and have an ask the price at that moment would be around euros we totally understand that the price would go up if the demand is high or else reasons but it does not mean that the price can soar into sky super rude staff a staff called wiliam the supervisor on the morning was really rude we were discussing about the price issue described above and at first we were really polite and we only asked for a fair price say euro per night but wiliam did not even give us a smile but replied mechanically that they cannot give us any discount he meant that we have to pay the price discussed above even though everyone knows that it is ridiculous since we are stupid more annoyingly when we were having conversation for some times he stopped and talked to another customer without any explanation and he was muttering something in french which i don t think would be something good i asked him why he ended our conversation abruptly and he said every customer has only minutes of conversation he also talked to us in front of another customer that we have occupied too much time letting another customer wait too long but there were at least three staff on the front desk no towel yeah you hear me in a four star hotel there was only one towel in the room one night we asked the front desk one staff only replied sorry we are out of stock sadly sorry means nothing and does not solve any problem cemetery behind the hotel of course the hotel won t tell you that until you check in there are two headings one to the cemetery and one to the main road which is noisy
