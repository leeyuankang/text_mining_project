negotiating the french underground without escalators or lifts at lower levels but the french people were very friendly and helpful it was a little disappointing that our hotel provided only one large bath towel and gave us a small hand towel to use instead saying that we were lucky to have it as it was the last one we discovered this lack of provision at pm at night
