the area was a little rough prostatutes on the streets less than from the hotel front door and a road of interesting establishments less than metres from the hotel front door i wanted to stay very central it was heard to determine the area until we got there it s not what it s described as from that perspective however the hotel was clean and the staff where very friendly and attentive speaking excellent english which is a real bonus the dining room could be improved as it s small and to close to the lobby it s basically in the lobby also you ended up sitting on tables with others which isn t great if you just want to sit with your family a few touches would change this the breakfast selection is good though
