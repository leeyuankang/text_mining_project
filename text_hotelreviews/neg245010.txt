small rooms very degraded and dirty old towels totally ripped and smelly the shower door was broken and they had put a string around to attach it a fridge that didn t work very unconfortable bed only one cup in the room eventhough we were two no water or sleepers or bathrobe nothing to do with a star hotel i would have given just two stars next time i will go to a simple ibis it would be cleaner and much cheaper oh and eventhough i asked three times their wifi never worked the elevators were old and scary too this hotel doesn t worth at all and it is too expensive for what it is
