rooms are extremly small breakfast is bad with very limited choices wifi so bad i was shocked as its suppose to be a hotel however its not even near one day i wanted to get something from room service at midnight and the feedback i received on the phone is that we dont have anybody to come to your room so you have to come down really again rooms are very small i mean that we had three bags and we couldnt even know where to put them
