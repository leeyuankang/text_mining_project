when i booked the hotel i included breakfast as part of the rate and requested for gluten free breakfast at first they told me that breakfast was extra at euros per person but when i showed the reservation they provided breakfast at no extra cost there was no gluten free bread for breakfast and when i asked them they nodded like it is what it is even though they told us that they would provide this was the only hotel during our weeks of travel in france that did not provide what we requested
