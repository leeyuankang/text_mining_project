it wasn t until the morning that we realised that the seal for the door that led to the balcony was broken the room was quite noisy because of that and my daughter and i were tired the next day down to lack of sleep i did try to inform the staff when checking out however the hotel was very busy with a private function so we weren t really a priority i did email the hotel twice to let them know about the broken seal and to be honest i am rather disappointed that they have not responded a month on
