the staff at reception seemed unable to help with simple enquiries until after much explanation to attain understanding of problems the signature luxury double room was extremely small for two people the bed was six inches away from the headboard which meant the pillows which were as soft as cotton wool kept slipping down the back the coffee and tea making facilities were poor in the room with cheap sachets of nescafe coffee provided you could not hang dress or trousers at full length in wardrobe the road outside is very busy and as there is no double glazing in the room the noise from the road is quite loud i will not return or recommend this hotel to anyone
