room felt musty and very small staff seemed untrained breakfast well just didn t happen waited minutes and order was ignored which meant that we had to leave to make out schedule without staff failed to apologise not a very happy welcoming environment in this hotel would not recommend it on the positive side one member of staff seemed helpful and knowledgeable wifi was not working in out room for much of our stay which meant going down to the small reception area to connect a hotel at best
