i was a little disappointed with the bar area wines and some drinks were limited which was a surprise also beacause they serve breakfast in the bar there wasn t really a comfortable relaxing space to just have a drink in the evening again a real surprise when so much thought has gone into this hotel all the tables were high and the seats chosen for people who would be eating
