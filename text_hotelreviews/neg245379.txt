nothing major breakfast choice was a bit disappointing and the price of gbp per person is too high for what they offer some parts were very dusty for example lamp in the room was full of dust and hasn t been cleaned at least for a year as well as the soft wall above the bed when we arrived there was only bathrobe for people but they brought second one straight away after we mentioned that so even if there were small things staff was very customer orientated and solved all issues fast
