the only negatives we have are of the actual room itself it was just too small for two people i m not sure if our room was especially small or if this is indeed standard for the hotel while the bed was comfortable it is only a queen with tiny nightstands on either side because of the lack of space we were constantly bumping into each other or having to step out of each other s way so just not ideal the closet is possibly the smallest closet i have ever seen in any hotel so i ended up having to use the chair to drape all my clothes the suitcases fit in a small niche that really served no other purpose and we thought would have been better served if it had been an extra closet or clothes hanging area there was no mini bar in the room which we thought strange there was a bottle of water in the room and some coffee and tea packets but that s it the initial feeling when you step inside the room is appreciative of the design and decor but a closer look and it just lacks the finish and quality that it initially leads you to believe it just felt a little tired the bathroom is actually a very good size in comparison to the room itself and boasts a large walk in shower full bath tub and single sink we did again struggle with the limited counter space and there was only two hooks behind the door so you had to step out of the shower or tub to get your towel or the bathrobe the mirror above the sink is so high that my wife couldn t see herself in it at all and had to use the full length mirror in the closet we re not sure how the room was heated but didn t have any issues until one night when we thought it was a bit too cold and we had no way of raising the temperature we didn t book the breakfast because we like to explore the city but we did check it out the first morning and felt it was very basic just some cold cuts and jams etc
