room was so small i felt claustrophobic hardly enough room walk round the bed no where to put the irritating and pointless cushions that hotel interior designers insist on putting on beds the wardrobe which would not hold the contents of even a small suitcase could only be accessed by one small door as the other door couldn t open because the bedside cabinet blocked it this wasn t a bedroom it was a large cupboard and ridiculous for the room rate paid
