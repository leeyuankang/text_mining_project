this is not a five star hotel that is quite a drastic mis advertisment by this hotel to be rated star on this website the is no gym spa or any kind of facilities to that nature hotel breakfast bar is small with a limited breakfast selection price however is the same as if i booked at park plaza at westminister that annoyed me this is a very comfortable very clean very small star boutique hotel
