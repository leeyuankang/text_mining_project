the room had a damaged shower drain which meant the smell was horrendous when brought to management attention in arrival it was suggested this was down to cleaning products there were no other rooms available so we had to live with it when we went to use the hotel bar in the evening we found out that they were running a private function that completely took over the hotel so we went out instead there was also supposed to be an ipad in the room too but after times of asking they never unlocked the screen on it in the end when we came to leave and settle we had to fight to get money off for the incredibly poor service and a room that stunk of swewage it wasn t until i produced a video of the floor tiles in the shower venting smelly liquid from their cracks were we given off a room which in my opinion with all the arguing that we had to do and as a customer with the hotel manager was still not enough we would never stay there again
