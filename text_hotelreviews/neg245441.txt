the room we booked was signature luxury king with balcony it turned out to be the smallest room that i have ever stayed over decades of travel to plus countries there was literally no space for our bags which we had to leave with the concierge through skillful photography the pictures on booking com create a false perception of space we were given room i strongly urge booking com to have the dimensions measured to realise how much of a gross misrepresentation has been made on its website
