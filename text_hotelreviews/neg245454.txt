upon arrival we wanted s drink in the bar we was told that the bar restaurent was closed for a function one guy interviewing someone so it would seem we asked when the bar would open the restaurant none of the staff knew they just said we don t really know for such s small hotel to have this area closed all evening was ridiculous meant that we could not use all the facilities of the hotel that we had paid for i believe if we had been advised of this then the price should have been allot cheaper and we would have made prior arrangements booked another restaurent near by for the evening
