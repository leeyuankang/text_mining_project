i was slightly disappointed i put in a request to have flowers a ballon left in the room upon booking as a surprise for my girlfriend this was clearly overlooked i believe the decor in the photo for the room i booked showed green bedding and curtains my girlfriends favourite colour but when we arrived the colour theme of the room seemed to be more red purple although we still loved this it wasn t particularly what i booked
