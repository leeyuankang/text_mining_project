great looking boutique hotel but lacks atmosphere needs nespresso machines in rooms my wifi signal was very hit and miss and the in room ipad wasnot switched on when i booked in they would not have sorted it if not told and as that gives information on all the hotel facilities it should be the first thing they do i feel they have a long way to go definitely only stars
