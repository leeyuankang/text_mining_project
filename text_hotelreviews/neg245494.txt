the rain shower s top quality although it needs to be looked after which speaks for the hotel as a whole tbh the shower head needs to be cleaned more often i resorted to cleaning it myself i shouldn t have had to ask for complimentary items such as toothbrush diffuser or bathrobes on arrival or wait half an hour for them to show room smelt of cigarettes too you should probably remind customers about this in the room itself don t leave everything to the ipad a booklet would do the iron and ironing board wasn t of great star quality you would expect though it got the job done trouser press or steam iron would be a good option too hotel branding s disappointing for a boutique but the interior decor made up for this lose the terrible vinyls on the wall in the room s as its really dated ipad functionality needs speakers in the room and ability to play local radio or spotify my room ultimate lux king included a continental breakfast one of the main reasons for my booking however i the app should notify you what time breakfast is served at the girl i spoke to at reception had to double check too breakfast lacked variety and was served with paper napkins it did not include the cappuccino i had albeit listed on the menu for you to charge me against my knowledge and then add grats on top is fairly outrageous for a cappuccino is rather extortionate and to not even be notified about it even when ordering is quite frankly unacceptable even though it is only i m sure it all adds up lounge and reception area needs more comfortable seating great room but eat elsewhere
