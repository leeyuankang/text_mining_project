deceiving as expecting a property no water in room on day hence no shower had to cross the street to sister hotel and shower in a recently vacated dirty room in a dirty bathroom no restaurant offering only sandwiches in the evening no one asked me how my stay went upon check out walls and doors are not noiseproof and i heard the neighbours having fun on multiple occasions very average stay will probably not stay there again
