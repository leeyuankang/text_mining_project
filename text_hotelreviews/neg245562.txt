the cleanliness of our room was disappointing the bed throw had bits all over it i found a false nail in the bathroom and the shower was dirty the head of the shower hadn t been cleaned meaning the water spouted in different directions the room was also very very small i m glad we booked into another hotel for our second nights stay couldn t manage more than one night in there
