disappointed the bar was out of use all afternoon until by which point we were going out due to a kids party so we had no where to relax out of our room we could hear the screaming of the party all around the hotel the bar area seemed inappropriate for such an event anyway so not sure why it was allowed i didn t ask but no good will gesture was offered and it was a special occasion so i d chosen the hotel partly because we were going to spend some time there for an afternoon relaxing left a sour taste unfortunately
