myself and my boyfriend stayed for a long weekend for my birthday on first impressions we were really impressed with the hotel however my boyfriend had arranged for flowers and chocolate to be in the hotel room when we arrived as it was my birthday and this wasn t done when my boyfriend asked about it the response was that they were going to do it later to which he told them not to bother as there was not much point as we were returning to our hotel very late that evening not a massive issue but a little disappointing the next morning we were then woken up by some loud music being played somewhere in the hotel not to mention having been kept awake by the loud hum of the air conditioning even though it was switched off we also tried to order breakfast on the ipad in the room but this proved impossible as the ipad kept freezing so we gave up these may only seem like small problems but for the amount of money we paid to stay in a star hotel we were disappointed when we spoke to staff about our problems they looked at us blank mindedly but told us they would log our complaints and come up with a solution for when we returned in the evening no one knew where the music was coming from nor was an attempt to find out made upon returning there was another lady on the desk gwen who knew absolutely nothing about our complaints no communication between staff and nothing had been done about our problems gwen very helpful and friendly the complete opposite to her coworkers we spoke to earlier gave us a new room and told us we would be able to have complimentary breakfast the next day not satisfied with the new room it was much smaller than the one we already had and the lock on the door was broken my boyfriend asked to speak to a manager at this point we were fed up and disappointed as we were paying a fair amount of money to stay in a supposed star hotel and were most definitely not having a star experience
