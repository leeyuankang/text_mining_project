the rooms are ridiculously tiny we booked the executive king with balcony the balcony was horrific with the only view being flat walls the room was so small that it was a struggle to actually open our suitcase around the bed for the price there are a lot better spacious rooms available in the london area the bathroom was dirty and felt like it needed a clean on the plus side the staff were extremely friendly
