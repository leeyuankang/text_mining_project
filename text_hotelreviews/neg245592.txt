the room was extremely small and claustrophobic for two people i don t feel like it was worth the amount i paid for one night and wouldn t have wanted to stay any longer no mirror in the room apart from one small one in the bathroom which was too high up for me to even see into the window didn t lock and the glass shelf in the bathroom fell off the wall when i put my makeup on it very expensive for such a room
