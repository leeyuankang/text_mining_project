we came back after the concert and had a very inexperienced bar tender he was very nice but a little untrained also there was a very drunk man who we found still in the bar in the morning having drunk all night my husband witnessed him being given a double baileys when we came down for breakfast obviously not the hotels fault his behaviour but maybe shouldn t have served him as he was then a lot of trouble staff very apologetic
