this hotel is a sad example for style over function while it makes a stunning first impression the rooms lack in usability no plugs in kitchenette to make tea no shelf near sink to put my cosmetics no towel rail beside washbasins the sofas look great but are uncomfortable the i pad cable was fixed to the i pad and to short to comfortably use the pad in bed one had to unplug the item to use it then it became a difficult job to plug it back in since the socket was behind a wall crevice
