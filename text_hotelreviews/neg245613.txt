we planned to eat before heading to the theatre but were told no food was available even though we had enquired that very afternoon we returned from our evening for a nightcap however couldnt relax as on our second drink we were handed the bill and told the bar had closed at considering being charged per drink for service we didnt feel we had good service when you cant relax felt rushed we asked for snacks and recieved a small bowl of crisps only to be told they had run out when we asked for more the room as lovely as it was had no mirror other than in the bathroom which made getting ready awkward
