the staff were not helpful and in fact were quite rude and did not seem over interested in our stay with them the breakfast was over priced and with good local facilities nearby i would eat there another guest appeared to be having a party with several people and what sounded like escorts didn t think this was that sort of hotel this went on at least until the shower and light needed a good clean
