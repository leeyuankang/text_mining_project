this was our return booking to this hotel for nights altogether on checking the receptionist s paper work we saw the management tried to trick us in giving us a smaller room than the one booked we booked signature luxury room they made a big fuss with smiles of fixing it when they were exposed then they proceeded to give us the same size small room this was unacceptable behaviour for a supposed star hotel when we did not accept the room after seeing it we were finally allocated the correct room we could have been fooled if we had not stayed there before also the two persons lift was hopelessly slow and small for taking luggage to the room
