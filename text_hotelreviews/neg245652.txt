at lunch i found a foreign object in my caesar salad i believe it to be either a piece of fingernail or white plastic food packaging the chef apologised and told me it was a piece of wood but changed his mind when challenged irrespective of what it was it shouldn t have been in my lunch which i was enjoying up to that point additionally the hotel ran out of hot water around o clock resulting in a cold shower before going out for the night no manager to report problem to and receptionist not really interested the issue was fixed by the morning and my lunch was refunded i raised these issues at check out and the hotel were proactive in refunding me half my bill i felt that this was about right
