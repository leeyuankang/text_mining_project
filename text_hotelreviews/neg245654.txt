the hot water didn t work when we got there and no good will or compensation was offered other than if we stayed in the hotel again wardrobe doors couldn t be opened without climbing over the bed room was very very small with hardly any room and unable to walk around the bed once the ironing board was setup staff were not very understanding and a little arrogant and rude my last email and voicemail was simply ignored and left with no response which is a sure sign of the customer service we experienced
