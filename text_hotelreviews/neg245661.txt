the information on the ipad are not updated slippers are not being provided i have not brought mine since slippers are included on the amenities list as a matter of fact i have asked for the item on my check in day but unluckily the staff told me that they are running out of stock the door of the shower stall cannot be closed as a result the water kept coming out to the washroom after every shower thus making the floor wet in fact i have reported this issue to the receptionist on the second day of my stay but such problem has not yet been fixed on my check out date i stayed at the hotel for nights in total
