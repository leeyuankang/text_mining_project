we only bumped into a few disappointments i felt it could have been made clear beforehand that we would have to pay a deposit on arrival for we hadn t expected this when checking in we would recommend they have irons in every room to save calling reception to find there isn t one available it would have been nice if the fire alarm hadn t gone off admittedly not too early and we didn t have to leave our room and even nicer if they apologised for the inconvenience other than these little glitches it was flawless
