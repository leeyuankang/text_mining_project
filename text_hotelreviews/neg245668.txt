on the negative side the reception service was below what is expected of a star hotel eg phoned for help with luggage on check out but none arrived and when we struggled downstairs with our luggage the luggage guy was in reception and hadn t been told by reception to help us also needed a print out of the receipt on checkout but the printer wasn t working so we were told that it would be emailed through by reception in minutes but a day later and still no sign
