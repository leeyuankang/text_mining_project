all facilities are badly maintained air conditioning noisy and even broken down first night called for help several times but took hrs for someone to confirm the air conditioning is not working then it came with no hot water and we ended up using other room for shower at midnight not even a word of apology from any hotel staffs all staffs did not smile at all this is the first time i receive such a poor service from hilton i would not recommend this hotel to any one
