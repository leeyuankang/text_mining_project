i was not informed at the time of booking and paying the full cost of accommodation that the hotel was undergoing noisy refurbishment the room had opaque film over the window which opened just a crack to look out onto scaffolding and sheeting which covered the whole of the front of the hotel the lighting system was faulty we were moved to another room after we shared our concerns which was even worse again screening over a window which didn t open it was like being in a prison cell despite requesting a bath this room had shower only
