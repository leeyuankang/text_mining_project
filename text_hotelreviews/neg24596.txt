my husband and i were very disappointed with our night stay at the doubletree by hilton london kensington we came to the uk from abu dhabi for days the main purpose of the trip being for me to have an operation we booked the hotel expecting to have a relaxing and comfortable last nights in london post operation we booked a queen guest room and couldn t believe what we saw when we arrived to our room a tiny dark and pokey room with no space outside of the bed and about inches from the window was a concrete wall it felt like a prison not the kind of room you would find in a doubletree by hilton hotel and totally overpriced for pounds per night we complained and as an act of goodwill one of the managers moved us to a suite for the same price he showed us the room and as we were rushing to go and grab some dinner neither one of us asked why it was so hot assuming the air conditioning was just switched off in actual fact the air conditioning was broken we had just one fan and this was during one of the hottest spells in the year so what appeared to be a goodwill gesture was indeed nothing more than a disingenuous token to shut us up as the manager would have known the air conditioning was broken when he offered us the complimentary upgrade when we returned from dinner and moved rooms we came into a hot and stuffy room which although better than the first room was very uncomfortable we had planned to stay in the hotel room the following day so i could relax post operation however this was not possible due to the lack of air conditioning we were given an extra fans which did not make much difference so spent sleepless nights in the hotel during our stay we noticed other guests complaining about the lack of air conditioning and issues connected to it like leaks in their rooms the staff were not overly concerned about the complaints
