our room wasn t done when we returned back about a few minutes later the room maid came to clean the room and my son was in the bathroom i asked her to return in a few minutes as we were going straight out again she said she was going off duty and would ask someone to do the room later it wasn t touched when we returned at it was disappointing as we were there nights and it would have made the visit so much nicer
