the breakfast was chaotic very busy fine but the actual buffet area was very small and badly organised for example the plates for a cooked breakfast were on the other side away from the serving area so people were milling about to try to get what they needed i had stayed in the doubletree hilton in glasgow the weekend before and the breakfast and hotel overall was much better
