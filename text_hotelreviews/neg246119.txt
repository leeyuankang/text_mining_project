we booked three rooms but one of our assigned rooms was not yet cleaned it was a bit of a shock to open a door to a dirty room but the staff quickly assigned a new room and apologized we would have preferred to be all on the same floor as originally booked but the new room was on a different floor as no more rooms were available we however managed to make it work we had the buffet on the first morning it wasn t what we was used to in terms of variety of offerings so on the second morning we decided to have the continental we came down at as it said on the notice board that it was from to turns out what we had were the leftovers from the buffet as they did not put out anything for the continental the guy in charge of the restaurant was insisting that we pay for a buffet even though he knew there was nothing much there and he was removing the rest of it while we were eating the guy at the front desk was really nice about it and apologized which was really very nice of him the guest bathroom leaves a lot to be desired there was only one toilet to be used by anyone waiting in the lobby and it was located on the floor its the last impressions that have the greatest impact you want to make sure people leave on a positive note
