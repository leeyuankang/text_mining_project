sink water was scolding hot on the coldest setting and burned my fiance we informed the front desk while sleeping we received a call at pm from the front desk in regards to a food order we didn t order anything and they acknowledged it was a mistake very frustrating since we were jet lagged and needed to wake up early for a wedding same thing we received a knock on the door at a m which woke us up it was a service person and they had the wrong room argh construction every morning and all day at the hotel the drilling woke us up in the morning the day after we got in it was so loud that we had to leave the hotel for the day immediately we should have been notified that construction was going on and received a discount when we booked this place very misleading the staff needs to be more organized and careful these mistakes are easily avoidable
