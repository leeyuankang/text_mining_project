the hotel is no way near to be called a star the room was very small the staff is very rude wifi is dead slow and to make it even worst the room air condition started to make sound it was scary and when i reported to the staff they just asked me to turn off the air con and keep saying that it is the only solution the smallest of hotels have a good wifi but this one supposedly a star hotel has one of the crap wifi it s really a bad situation to be we booked expensive hotel hoping that it will be good but they cheated us by not maintaining minimum standards in the lift i spoke to couple of other guests they were telling the same if you re looking for a decent hotel this is definitely a no i would never go to this hotel again i really wonder how it has got such good reviews maybe a fake ones i guess
