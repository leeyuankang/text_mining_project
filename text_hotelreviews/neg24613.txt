maintenance work going on but i wasn t told about this at the time of booking even though i only made the booking the day before arrival and the scaffolding up against the hotel clearly indicates the work is long standing it did stop at on the friday but i wanted to sleep for a few hours upon arrival but that was impossible due to ongoing hammer action drilling
