the lack of a second easy chair in the bedroom it would be no problem to fit a second one in the space in the room the lack of a small proper chest of drawers we mentioned this to the reception and the hotel member of staff said that the hotel was going to be refurbished in the near future and proper chests of drawers were on the agenda for inclusion there is plenty of space in the room for one currently there are only two small drawers in the bedside cabinets however they were enough for our three night stay on this occasion
