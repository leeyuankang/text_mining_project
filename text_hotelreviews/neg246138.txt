getting to the hotel was not very easy first of all arrived there and was told that our reservation was cancelled by them with no warning after travelling from lyon to paris before we go back home to ireland the front office personnel was not very accommodating made us feel that we do not belong to this hotel if this is the case why is this hotel on booking com we had to give euros as a deposit in case we open the mini bar or make a phone call why were we not informed of this beforehand we my wife and i are both in the hospitality business and never did we experience a so called star hotel like this and same for the staff we felt so small and as soon as we got the room we were shocked to see the state of the carpets as soon as we opened the door to the room filthy and stained all over as can be seen in the photos we were expecting to see a glance of the eiffel tower but to our surprise when opening the curtains was more dirt and cigarettes butts everywhere the bathroom tiles and the grouts were below standards for a so called star a little radiator on stand by glass for adults in the room shampoos but no shower gel or soap thank goodness my wife brought a shower gel we have stayed in star hotels before hand such as hayfield manor in cork ireland or even through booking com and have always been treated same as other guests with respect and was not looked down very disappointing experience over all same for the breakfast which was per head and no hot milk half of the toaster was broken not great value for money we have attached some photos to explain how disdain of the place we were also told that booking com was supposed to let us know that our reservation was cancelled while we got an email from your site asking how was our reservation if you think of booking this hotel through booking com dont expect the room shown on the pictures
