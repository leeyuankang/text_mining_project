we arrived at the room which had not been vacuumed the manager offered other and we change to the floor this day and the following we stay without wifi i went to the manager again because i needed to answer some emails for my job this time the manager was in the evening night time a young girl that didn t can to make decisions and the only option they give me was to pay euros per hour using their computer she refused to call her superior and was not worried about my problem i booked a room with wi fi included so in my understanding if they dont give me the money back they cant not ask me to pay more for sure we are not going back to this hotel the hotel is good but far away to be a start hotel
