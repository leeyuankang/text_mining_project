when we went to the bar for a drink having been out all day we found it very quiet with no atmosphere the bar staff although pleasant were more interested in getting the area ready for breakfast next morning than passing the time of day with customers i suppose they had their jobs to do there is also a lack of tourist leaflets information around the reception area although staff were helpful when they were asked
