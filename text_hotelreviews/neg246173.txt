every time we went to the hotel bar it was closed and no it wasn t in unusual times it was during the day sunday there was no cleaner i guess normal for a sunday but we could have been reminded as it isn t the norm in all countries when checking out we were informed that we had to pay per person per night surely that could have been sucked up on the price for the hotel the parking area below the hotel was slightly difficult accessibility wise if you have a slightly larger car coming into the parking area it was a spiral concrete walled access way we had an audi and there were a lot of scrape makes on the walls from other vehicles getting too close
