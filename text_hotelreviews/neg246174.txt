bad info re taxi prices led to a disagreement with an airport taxi driver also i booked a triple room and was given two beds staff initially refused to change rooms even though they had availability i had to get arsey to get it sorted which was a shame it s a very basic hotel has the feel of a budget place but without the budget prices
