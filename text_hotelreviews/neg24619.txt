one night the room was not cleaned at all i found the cleaners and got towels and told them to forget about it another night we returned at about and the room still was not made up we left about when someone came the stairs on the hall would have been difficult to negotiate if someone was a little disabled the tv control did not work and was changed but would be nice if this stuff was checked periodically
