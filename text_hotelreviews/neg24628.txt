this was the second time this week that we stayed at the hotel what a stark contrast it was i was told that i should park my car on the other side of the road when there was ample parking space infant of the hotel i ignored this as there was no reason for me to move my car the staff were not as welcoming as last time and when i had a query about my hilton honours points it was going nowhere therefore never again
