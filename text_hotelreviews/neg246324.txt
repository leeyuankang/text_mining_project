i very much regret that i was not informed that when a cab is booked through the hotel twice the price of a street cab would be charged i complained about this to two different staff members both said they would look into the issue and would get back to me however none did what i am left with now is not being informed about the fact that i would have to pay double the price to the cab arranged by the hotel plus my complaints not being taken into consideration which is very disappointing
