we had a junior suite the furniture other than the bed was not comfortable style over comfort the sofa comfort would be vastly improved by large squashy cushions ditto the easy chair if you planned to be out most of the time this is not significant the menu is somewhat limited especially if you have gluten free requirements however the staff did try hard to accommodate special needs the menu has a range of pizza and sandwiches but as he is gluten free my son was limited to fillet steak rib eye steak or a gluten free tagliatelle which came undercooked it would have been nice to have gluten free veal and lamb options
