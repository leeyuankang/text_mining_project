there was a faint smell of smoke from my bedding there was a cigar room nearby and that might have been the reason i would have preferred not to have had a room with an accessible bathroom it didn t have a bath and i was looking forward to relaxing in one i also thought the restuarant was overpriced the service was excellent but i struggle to justify paying for two fillets of fish green beans and tomatoes
