the room is really small i stayed in many hotels in london but even for london it is very small for the price we paid pounds i would expect bigger room for two persons with at least some desk chair and area to place the bag in the room we got it was really no space for anything from entrance from the door you get directly to the bed to open the wardrobe you should find other place where to move your bag and there is no really any more space the bed itself was also not too big for two persons this room would be probably ok just for night stay as a single but definitely overpriced and non comfortable for two persons
