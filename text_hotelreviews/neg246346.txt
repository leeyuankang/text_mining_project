the staff at breakfast we had paid for and had been informed that it was a breakfast buffet however this was so the first morning but there was a different chef and one totally incompetent waiter for the entire dining area the second the in charge staff dealt with this in a most professional manner i m confident that this was not the normal occurrence and we would definitely stay here again
