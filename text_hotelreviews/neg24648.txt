the ground floor room was the nosiest i have ever stayed in because of the air conditioning piping and very small our shower was broken and there was not enough towels for people upon entering our room the porter told us that he and hotel staff are usually given this room to stay in never again will i stay at this hotel having stayed at several other double trees this hotel really did not live up to the standard i have seen at sister hotels if you are offered a ground floor room then refuse
