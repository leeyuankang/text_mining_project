we booked for a standard king room for me my husband and old kid however they said they couldnt let my child stay in the same bed with us even if their policy states that choldren below stay for free as long as sharing existing bed we ended up paying additional per night which was out of our budget it was such a hassle and it was a really unpleasant experience
