i was travelling with my baby and her buggie there are some steps at the entrance of the hotel and to the breakfast room that were a bit of an inconvenience the room was super small to the point where the baby s buggie wouldn t fit on either side of the bed it could only stay on the internal aisle between the bed and the door i found breakfast to be quite expensive for what it was i reccomend saving the money and exploring other restaurants in the area
