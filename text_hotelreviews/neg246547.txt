the cost was much more that other hotels of similar standard in the area i was charged more than was quoted by booking com and a prepayment was taken from my bank account a month before our arrival the first two nights we spent there were in a very small basement room where we could not even open the frig or wardrobe as the bed was wedged against them the staff originally refused to move us to a room that was pictured on your website and our booking sheet i would not have booked the tiny room we were given and only after explaining the misrepresentation were we changed for the last nights of the stay
