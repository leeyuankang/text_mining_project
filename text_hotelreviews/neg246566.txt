we just got a bit confused at the beginning and went to the wrong mercure it would be nice if their website had a map from the station so you could see exactly how to walk from paddington to the hotel not just words but words and graphics would be handy the blow dryer has to be used from the bedroom you cannot use it in the bathroom as there is no plug for it this seems to be a mercure thing not sure why they don t get this part but it is a bit inconvenient maybe they have more male visitors and it is not an issue
