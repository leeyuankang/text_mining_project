however i was very upset by how the hotel assigned rooms at first the hotel assigned us the room in the hotel indigo as they said we stayed for a longer period and the hotel indigo which they said was part of the same parent company had a larger room we got a really small and shitty room and this hotel was not at the same standard star level as mercure this was not what i paid for star hotel i spent more than half an hour and tried to get a room in the mercure we were selected by the computer system to relocate to a different hotel because they oversold the rooms doesn t it sound like another ua event
