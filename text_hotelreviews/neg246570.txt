room was smaller than expected and storage and hanging space limited certainly limited if travelling with more than one case as we were so had to leave a lot in cases we had privilege room which is supposed to be square meters per website details i would be surprised if it was including entrance and ensuite the room is per decorated and furnished as picture on website but it is smaller than it looks there is practically no room other than the bed half a meter maximum either side and a meter at end of bed so very tight a small desk but you cant pass if someone is sat there we had to ask for additional toiletries and towels on a few occasions and there were some minor cleaning issues a nice room but not privilege and smaller than advertised
