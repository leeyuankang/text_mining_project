particularly room was advertised as a family room but was really just a basic double room with a cot we were also put on the lower ground floor directly below reception and lobby meaning you could hear suitcases rolling and shoes constantly above along with not having black out curtains and a sensor light that turned on and off throughout the night that room should not be used for guests and certainly was not a value for money
