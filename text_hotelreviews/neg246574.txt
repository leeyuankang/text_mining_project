room was opposite elevator i was woken every time it was used room was so small it was a struggle to get round the bed and once my case was on the stand you couldn t get round at all also there was a dangerous shelf above the coffee tea facilities and as i leant in to select my coffee i caught my head on its sharp corner i reported this to management but they didn t swam to care about guests wellbeing
