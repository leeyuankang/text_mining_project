breakfast if there is anything that they can really improve it would be this the food served was ok but it gets really boring if you are staying for more than days as it is the same thing every single day it is inconsistent perhaps times i had breakfast they ran out of cutlery cups etc and i had to ask someone before they brought new clean ones out the servers were mostly grumpy and unpleasant some of them were ok but most of the staff there made us feel like they d rather not have us there sometimes the person in charge of greeting guests as they come in do not even greet us or say hi which i find very strange
