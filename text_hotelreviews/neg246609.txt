we booked a family room but this was basically a room with a very uncomfortable fold out bed in there were not enough towels for three or amenities in addition to this the room was too hot and not enough air for three people as it was so small we opened the window but could not keep it open as there was some sort of flue outside it buzzing away and expelling dirty air into our room very disappointed with the size of the room and the lack of tea coffee cups towels etc for our son
