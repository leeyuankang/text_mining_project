the evening before my arrival at the hotel booking com sent me an email saying that they couldn t verify my credit card so maybe my booking was not sure i red the email once in the airport at the gate just before boarding it was not a good news i don t why but their booking system didn t accept my credit card visa maybe because it s a rechargeable card i don t know but in other places in london it worked however i had also brought cash so at the end i had no problem at all just be sure that your credit card works or bring cash
