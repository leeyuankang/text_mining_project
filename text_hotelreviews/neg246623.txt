not so much something i didn t like but something that was a little confusing is the fact that the hotel is linked to another hotel indigo hotel attached at the back and we ended up staying with them in a separate apartment a couple of doors down the apartment was on the third floor with no elevator but that was just a minor issue one of the staff was happy to carry the bags for us also the mercure website doesn t seem to list this actual hotel mercure hotel at talbot square on their website so it was very difficult to phone them directly it is easy to confuse it with another mercure hotel right closer to paddington station we stayed at the mercure indigo hotel in talbot square
