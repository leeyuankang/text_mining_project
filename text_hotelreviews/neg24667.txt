the breakfast was disappointing due to undercooked sausages and overcooked scrambled eggs we asked for champagne with our breakfast and the waitress had to check we are paying customers and didn t expect to be treated like children the waiter would not stop looking over at us which made us feel uncomfortable and rushed the rooms are very small and cramped the light in the bedroom entrance was very frustrating while getting ready as it kept turning off and no option to leave on or off consistantly so turned on in the middle of the night when going to the toilet
