room was quite small and almost all the space was taken up by the large bed only one small window which had zero view as the glass was frosted was all right for one person spending most of my time out of the room but would not have worked for two people a larger person or someone who needed to spend more time in the room for example working plumbing in the room seemed old bathtub was slippery even when bath mat used whole mat slipped and toilet flush box would not refill after first use had to flush toilet by pouring a bucket of water manually and then call maintenance it was repaired the same evening but did not make a good impression bathtub lacked any sizable shower enclosure making it hard to keep shower water in tub wi fi did not work well was very glitchy and not very useful for anything other than facebook or light web browsing upon one return to the hotel a doorman actually blocked my way until i explained i was a guest although he apologized when he realized i was actually staying there
