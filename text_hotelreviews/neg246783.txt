small room no wifi no breakfast and considering it was called london bridge hotel i expected it to have a view of the bridge which it doesn t but it is very close it definitely wasn t worth per night i won t be staying there again or recommending it we were also in the room above the entrance and it was quite noisy with people coming and going oh and there is no view at all from the hotel just another building we could barely see because there are net curtains squeezed in between the outer glass and the sliding window with venetian blinds in front of that really not impressed
