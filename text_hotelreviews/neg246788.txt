after checking into our room later the same day another couple we given our room much to our surprise when they let themselves in whilst we were in the room luckily neither myself or my husband were undressed showering at this time or even out leaving our valuables in the room therefore our basic requirements of security and privacy were not met the staff did not contact us to apologise instead we had to complain and get upset with them before they would offer any compensation
