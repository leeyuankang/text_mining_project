we had a room for three the third bed was a pull out which is fine but it came with no blankets we asked for blankets then left and when we came back hours later still had no blankets and had to ask the front desk i found hair in the food the bed and on the bathroom floor our tv did not work and we had to ask for it to be fixed multiple times one of the lights did not work and in fact the plug was sparking we showed the individual who came to the room when we called to have our tv fixed again we told her we would unplug it so it didnt start a fire and nothing more was done about it we were just without a light in regards to the food in the buffet the cream and the pastries were great the eggs were cold and somehow powdery and runny at the same time and the drinks were all warm basically if it was supposed to be cold it was warm and vise versa i would stay here again as i dont go to paris for the hotel but for the price it was i was expecting much more
