not that it s the hotel receptions responsibility but on checkin the receptionist help translate my paris passlib package and saw that we had a reservation for the eiffel tower for the next morning the next morning i asked for late checkout by which by no means is a guarantee but they understandably couldn t accommodate due to an incoming guest we check out early and head to the eiffel tower for our scheduled reservation time but the eiffel tower was closed due to worker strikes that had been going on for the past couple of days if the receptionist would of given us some kind of info that the tower was closed it would have changed our whole day and we could of planned accordingly before we checked out of the hotel early instead with my year old mother and month old daughter we were essentially left out in the cold to top off our trip we decided to just head to the train station earlier then planned and just wait for our train since we were at the train station ahead of our schedule we witnessed an attempted mugging and we were all inadvertently sprayed with pepper spray luckily my daughter was in her stroller and was not directly affected as we were a little heads up that the tower was closed or could possibly closed would of went a long way especially considering the proximity of the hotel to the tower is why i chose this hotel to begin with without a doubt in my mind if the receptionist would of given us the info concerning the tower closure we would have not witnessed the mugging and been pepper sprayed paris just isn t what it used to be
