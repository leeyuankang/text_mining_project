we had to swap rooms on the night of our stay due to a fan and other humming noises which got louder throughout the night also we are having issues with the pre authorisation on our account blocking and the hotel do not seem to understand when we have contacted them and asked them to send a fax our bank telling them our bill has been paid so the block can be remove asap they keep on saying we have paid our bill
