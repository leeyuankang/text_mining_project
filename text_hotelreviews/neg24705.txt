it is annoying to queue for breakfast in the morning the hotel is even well aware of the issue why don t you offer breakfast free of charge outside of rush hour to alleviate the issue the rooms at the hilton honors floor are ridiculously small it is like coming into a room in a manhattan hotel all claims regarding rooms being in sophisticated style should perhaps be augmented by saying that it would help if guests are not above and or kg then there is one annoying detail which the reception should be aware of but apparently they are not as they are handling customer s credit cards all the time instead of asking upfront if the customer wants to pay the hotel bill upfront the hotel staff makes reservations on your card checking if the card is ok what they do not realize is that standard mc and amex services are such that reservations get stuck on your card effectively for a month thus i got away with a small bill paid in full the hotel is not that expensive but the reservations on my card were at the same order of magnitude being very annoying travellers like myself who are travelling often would not like to have outstanding reservations on our credit cards at the same magnitude as what we spend per month on hotels i can live with the small room but i am annoyed about this kind of ignorant rude behaviour towards even hilton h members
