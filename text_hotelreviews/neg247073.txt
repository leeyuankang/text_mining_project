london restaurants are hard to get a table at i wished that the concierge was a bit more influential to get us in those places they re not bad but not fantastic there was a sewage problem at the hotel when we went there the smell was really bad and we couldn t enjoy the facilities because of it they gave us a cupcake and a letter to apologize
