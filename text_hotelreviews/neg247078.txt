there s service charge on top of your room bill which they don t tell you about until it s time to pay for your stay then they make you feel like you have to pay it we didn t feel service was worth when we were only staying two nights and didn t even spend much time in the hotel the other disappointment was residents breakfast whichonly included scones which were fresh and lovely and tea coffee however if you wanted something different you had to pay extortionate prices
