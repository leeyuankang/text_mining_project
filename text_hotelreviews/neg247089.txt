the breakfast was confusing and while we had booked inclusive breakfast we were charged when we complained it wasn t explained what was inclusive and what was extra and we only had pancakes and toast with orange juice and toast and the oragange juice never arrived the cost was removed from the bill it could have been communicated better though to avoid spoiling our otherwise excellent stay
