our air conditioner was broken and the room was very hot the staff seemed somewhat indifferent they did offer a fan and suggested we open the window sadly the street noise was unbearable so we closed the window and sweated it out for two nights as the hotel was booked full the third night they did move us to a cooled room which was wonderful we were grateful for that in the second room everything was clean and well kept all the glassware in the first room had obviously been used by prior guests as there were lip marks and fingers prints on them we had expected the second night we would have received clean glasses but we got the same ones over again for a hotel which could be top notch with such little effort this was disappointing i wish i could give top marks and really want to say i loved this place but it fell short they are so close to having a really great hotel so i hope they will address some of these issues
