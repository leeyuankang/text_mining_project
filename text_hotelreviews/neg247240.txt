we were misinformed twice on two days we asked about buying day tube passes and were told falsely that it was not necessary as if you used you credit card with a tab you would only be charged the maximum for a day well low and behold that only applies to residents not visitors the last experience was simply the worst as we were checking out and we asked about a cab taxi and they said the street was blocked off in front of the hotel and all we had to do was walk to end of street and they were there waiting well not the case at all the entire area was blocked off and my wife and i had to cross the thames hauling our bags to eventually take an uber about minutes later we were stressed and sweaty just barely made it on time to the airport i was so upset contacted them from the airport and they said we should have read the signs in the hotel and web site about street closing due to events they did not acknowledge the inconvenience at all conclusion do your own research and lower your expectations for service at this hotel
