furnishings in room were a bit worn and tired bed sheets or mattress underneath had a few stains but in fairness they were clean i did check with a small uv light i carry with me also in fairness on the sheets i did not complain as it was pretty minor and they were clean if i had complained i suspect the staff would have addressed it also didn t like that i had to use stairs regardless of the direction i approached the room not bad without luggage but if you have luggage in tow it would have been nice to have a ramp in at least one direction the technology for the tv was overall great but i would have liked the ability to sign on to my own social media accounts such as youtube in order to access my own playlists
