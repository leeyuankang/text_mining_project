in a two week trip through countries this was the only bad hotel accommodation and it was the worst i have ever experienced at this level hotel in us or abroad the rooms were awful the bed and pillows were hard as rocks it was so hot in all rooms we tried a c broke in first room moved from a suite to a twin after begging for a room with a c originally told they didn t have another room they were going to force us to stay in the broken a c room and rent the one we ended up in probably we were lied to repeatedly hot in the new room as well and of us on twins pushes together at am i had to go to desk and ask for fans next time we had a room with a loft for the bathroom and double bed the loft was so hot it was on the top floor heat rises there was a small box a c that ran continuously but never cooled off the room there was a crying baby in the next room that sounded like it was in the room with us the traffic outside was so loud in the room as well that happened in of the rooms there were green lights on the ceiling of the loft i think to light up the stairs that stayed on permanently and it was like daylight in the bedroom it had a skylight with no cover so at the crack of dawn more light streamed in after repeated attempts with management we had prepaid in full so they didn t care we literally left in the middle of the night and went to a much more expensive but lovely cool quiet beautiful hotel to get one good night s sleep in london it was the best move we made and we should have left after the first incident this is our trip to london always in the heat of summer and the only bad experience we have ever had with our hotel accommodations i have never had to complain to management about a hotel room before in london after over nights worth of accommodations management was barely apologetic
