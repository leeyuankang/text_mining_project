breakfast is expensive and not so good better go to the nearest cafe or restaurant printme com service is not actually working or i just wasn t able to figure out how to do it there is no such app where you can enter your document id if there is no paper in printer you need to go to reception on another floor i was expecting bathrobe and slippers in such hotel only small tube of shower gel and shampoo for people is just not enough people on reception may be a little more pleasant except the guy who did check in for us he was great
