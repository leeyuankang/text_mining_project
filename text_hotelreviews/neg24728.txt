the room and breakfast were prepaid and still we had to pay deposit we booked a twin superior room and got a room on the floor just under the roof very hot small window no curtains airco didn t work good they offered us another room on the same floor which we didn t take because other guests on the floor had all the same complaints if you book this hotel don t accept a room on the floor even is it is a superior room
