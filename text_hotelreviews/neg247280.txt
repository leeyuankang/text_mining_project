directions to room was confusing didn t like our room on opposite side to northumberland ave and especially did not like the stairs we discovered we had to take once out of lift and into the area where our room was located i was very tired from flight and was sick of having to lug my suitcase up and down underground station stairs and then had to lug it up yet more stairs to access our room in hotel staff at reception should have warned us of this and maybe offered some assistance rooms on northumberland side much easier to access we stayed here once before and preferred our room on last visit
