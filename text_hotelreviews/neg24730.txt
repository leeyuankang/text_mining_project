the room was not ready when we checked in second time we were not expecting it to be ready at when we first arrived but when we tried to check in after when they said it would be ready we had to wait minutes and we were not the only travellers who had the same experience one couple were checked into a room which was already occupied there was no leadership of the reception staff and there was an element of chaos which could have easily been resolved by some senior staff present to reassure guests the hotel has only recently been taken over by hilton and they need to sort this out quickly as this is a very popular hotel for returning guests breakfast was ok but not worth which you would have had to pay if it wasn t pre booked
