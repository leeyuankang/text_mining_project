for london the rates are not surprising and although pricey this is still not a hotel and don t expect luxury treatment toiletries are limited only one bottle of shower gel shampoo and body lotion per day per two persons no hair conditioner no earbuds no seeing kit no shoe polish etc you won t be finding a chocolate on your pillow we only got one face towel to be shared among two persons and two shower towels as a standard everyone should have a separate face towel this really is not a budget hotel no socket in the bathroom so you can only dry your hair in the room there was no minibar in the room there was a fire alarm at hotel staff were not around and were not informing guests if we should evacuate the reception desk and housekeeping weren t answering the phone and we couldn t get any information if it was safe or not
