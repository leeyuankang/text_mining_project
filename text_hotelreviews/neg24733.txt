a c broke in middle of night it s rarely hot in london but this summer has been an exception it s unbearable asked for a c to be fixed while we were out for the day came back about hours later ready for bed and a c still broken no one ever came took hours to get moved from a bedroom suite to a single room with of us in a new room ridiculous spent time on phone with manager had to go to front desk to get action and that still took an hour moved to a small cramped room that heated up about am had to go get fans from front desk then absolutely no sleep with a small hot rooms and people on twin beds pushed together barely apologetic the next morning noted they are renovating and have had trouble with a c so they knew about it but only wanted to give a small discount off the down graded hot room we were moved to poor customer service i warned them i would be posting a bad review for their service and asked for it to all be corrected they didn t seem to care so the best response i know is to follow through would not stay here again if i had an option
