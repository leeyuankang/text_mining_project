we arrived at one o clock and although we could leave our bags would have liked to have been able to freshen up in our room before three o clock surely if guests have to leave by twelve noon some rooms will be vacant before three it felt like someone was sticking to a rigid rule rather than putting them selves in the shoes of the customer which is the essence of good service but the staff were otherwise friendly and helpful
