noise we couldn t open the window because there was an engine on the roof that made a lot of noise constantly day and night so we had to close the window and open the air condition but the air conditioner was very old and made a lot of noise too so i couldn t sleep well i guess it s not relevant for all the rooms but the rooms that happen to be at the side of this engine unfortunately i forgot the room number
