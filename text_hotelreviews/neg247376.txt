ironing facilities which were one of the reason to choose the grand among the similar hotels in the area are not really a part of room facilities they are shared not a big issue but requires a bit of an extra arrangement the room we booked standard queen room was rather dark and with a strange smell didn t feel right for that class of the hotel staff were very nice we were offered to change to a brighter but smaller room without a safe box and mini bar not sure if it was a fair exchange but at the end we jury s enjoyed the location a lot
