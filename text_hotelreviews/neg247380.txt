quite simply the entrance and bar restaurant is a disaster tables and hard chairs in front of the bar what was wrong with how you had it before with soft comfortable leather sofas and chairs it was much more welcoming and looked classy and in keeping with the hotel now it looks like a cheap cafe and something you ve just added on for the day if you think about it what else is on offer to visitors it all centres around the entrance it s a meeting place we won t return unless this is changed
