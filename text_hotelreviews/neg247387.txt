poor breakfast arrangements the cooked breakfast did not include the continental buffet so if you wanted anything from the buffet as well you had to pay for the full continental breakfast on top of the cost of the cooked breakfast the air conditioning in the bedroom was ineffective and the room was stifling even with the window open it wasn t possible to get the temperature down to a comfortable level
