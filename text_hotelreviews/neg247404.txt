we were showed three rooms all small poor view no fridge some no bath anyway we eventually ended up in a show room next morning we asked room service for fresh coffee we had to go down for that okay we went down and your male staff did not even know what coffee it was we tried one it was look warm we left it and went down the road for a decent coffee that night after the show we went to bed pm and had the worst nights sleep possible with the noise outside and residents slamming the doors subsequently we only got a couple of hours sleep the next day we wandered around london like zombies having a few drinks thinking that would help however despite this again we had an appalling nights sleep to such an extent monday we just checked out going straight to victoria with a train back to brighton
