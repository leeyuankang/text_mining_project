did not like the fact that money was stolen from a locked suitcase after house keeping cleaned the room the staff did not seem to care about the fact money was stolen or do anything about it the fact that when i checked in they tried to up the price by and that housekeeping woke us up at to clean our room would not recommend to anyone unless you want money stolen and want to be woken up at the crack of dawn
