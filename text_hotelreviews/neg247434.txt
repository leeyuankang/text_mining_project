the charge for breakfast i thought was rather high when you can eat in the restaurant on an evening for less i would recommend not booking breakfast as there are plenty of places nearby where you can pick up a coffee and something to eat i also thought the queen suite for a family of three would be larger than it was there wasn t much space at all in the room for a family when you opened the bathroom door it banged against the sofa bed the only place to sit because of this on an evening was on the bed
