i think i was given a disabled room which is fine but could have been nicer without chair in shower and disabled toilet at checkin the hotel wanted to pre auth my credit card for in case of damages this wasn t made clear prior to booking and took a bit of negotiating to get them not to do it if i damage something i will pay for it but i won t allow them to charge me for something they believe i have damaged without inspecting the room prior to my stay with me and inspecting it afterwards also the pre auth will lower my available spend not something i want when i m tight for cash and trying to enjoy my stay in london
