cleaning staff careless on soap replacements and water replacements rather than cleaning an obviously dirty linen they just turned it upside down cleaning staff leaves used towels on the sink neither replaced nor put away have travelled a lot and this staff was below par for such a hotel chain the official shampoo lotion in the rooms virtually impossible to use they come in these lean tall cylindrical bottles that are too hard to squeeze any product out of and the rubber top too tight for product to be shaken out what a waste of product money don t think this was ever tested by those that designed those bottles water pressure in showers very low not that close to subway stops
