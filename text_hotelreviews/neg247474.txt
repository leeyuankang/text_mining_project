breakfast taken in restaurant staff not at all helpful or pleasant particularly as i explained we were in a hurry left to fend for ourselves no service given and they had the cheek to charge service charge on a bill of for some tea and toast for people when leaving i did say that i did not wish to pay the service charge but it was still included on my room bill lift from pavement into hotel usually not working very difficult with my elderly mother in wheelchair and grandchildren in prams would not stay there again
