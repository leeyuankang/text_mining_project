rooms were very cramped with a huge carpeted step not clearly marked which was a big trip hazard you had to ask to get adequate soap and towels staff struggled to speak english there was no fridge at all in room i have never seen this before in a star hotel especially a hilton i requested an iron twice and it never arrived although i was told it would come straight away both times in all a very disappointing experience then to top it off when we checked out we were charged twice we realised immediately and were told this was normal as they process the credit card on registration so you pay up front although were were clearly told pre authorisation is never processed but then on discharge you pay bill completed with extras they do not reverse original charge for up to to a week later their attitude and handling of our complaint on this was very much that they don t care in all this was my a good experience i would never recommend this hotel and will not stay at hilton again
