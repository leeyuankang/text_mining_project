arrived at hotel to be told our room not ready very disappointing when we were told we could book in from we needed to get ready as we had early table booked at a restaurant and evening show when finally showed to our room just after the air con wasn t working and the room was very warm we were moved to a smaller room around which left less than an hour to get ready this did somewhat spoil our experience as we had a long journey so no time for a rest the air con in this room stopped working in the middle of the night which meant a very uncomfortable nights sleep the staff were apologetic and did try their best to help but there seemed a lack of overall leadership in the reception area which probably needs addressing surprisingly for a hotel of this standing there was no visible bar so when we ordered drinks they weren t poured in front of us the staff disappeared to what may have been a kitchen and then reappeared some time later with the drinks when paying for drinks it would have added to the experience to have seen them being poured at the bar
