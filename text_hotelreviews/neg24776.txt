since the hotel got acquired by hilton they have forgotten to look after their previous customers aligned to the regency hotel most of us came along because this was a boutique hotel these days it s really catered for the tourists and such and lost its way for customer service it s all about revenue i guess i have stayed at this hotel since i and my team will be looking to stay somewhere else in the future if opinions don t change for the better
