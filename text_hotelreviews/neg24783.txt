we didn t like the fact that there was an extremely noisy air conditioning vent right outside our bedroom window also the tea making facilities were behind the door and the light was on a time switch and kept going off once when i was pouring boiling water to make coffee generally the room was poorly lit we certainly would not want to stay in that room again
