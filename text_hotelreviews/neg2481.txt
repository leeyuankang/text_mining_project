the room was very difficult to access within the building which consists of townhouses that have been remodeled as a hotel we had to go up an elevator up some stairs down some others and it was confusing long and very difficult to handle with our heavy bags thankfully the staff is attentive and responsive and there to help with luggage another issue was that while the bed and room was clean the window was very dirty the window was also small due to the location of the room within the building
