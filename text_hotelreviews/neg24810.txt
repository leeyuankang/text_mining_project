it wasn t worth the money i booked queen superior rooms for the same price and found that one was much smaller and cramped compared to the other in fact there was just enough room to walk around the bed in the smaller one when i brought the issue to the reception i was told that that s just how it is which is ridiculous asked to change rooms and found ourselves in a reasonably sized room on the top floor but it was stuffy and old and not up to the standard you d expect from hilton or the regency also the rooms and had electrical wiring stapled to the walls in the open not at all worth a night
