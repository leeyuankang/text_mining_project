my wife elected to pay for the stay via cash this caused problems when checking out as it was not reflected on the computer thankfully she had kept a copy of the receipt even after showing the receptionist the receipt there was still problems thankfully they were resolved but i dread to think what would have happened if i hadn t kept receipt
