the only two bad things i can say is one of the staff members waiter was quite rude and didn t understand much english being in london you think hotel staff would have to know english cannot fault the reception staff though very friendly and very helpful also we requested a room with a nice view weeks before we stayed and we did not get this but i did not want to complain as its only a small thing and seems silly so in future all i can say is let people who have requested something know you cannot meet what they are asking for
