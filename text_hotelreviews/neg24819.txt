my daughter gave deposit on her debit card then when we paid our bill her money was frozen she could not get this sorted for six days after we came home she spoke to staff in hotel they said a new member of staff should not have taken deposit on a debit card then said it was up to her bank to sort it out her bank said no nothing they could do as it was paid to your hotel very disappointed as she had no cash other than what was in her account and she could not get it sorted by the hotel staff
