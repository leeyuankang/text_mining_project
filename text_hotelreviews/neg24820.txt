the bed was so soft it was vey difficult to sleep there were a lot of noises in the room from the pipes from the rooms next door there were people running and loud in the hallways both nights at and the floor was under construction and repair with plastic on the floor and lights dangling from the ceiling and the elevator that would not reach the floor where i had my room this would definitely qualify for a discount
