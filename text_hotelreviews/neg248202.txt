first of all the room itself double is missing many expected elements there is no fridge which is quite surprising and painful more they provide a big tv which is impossible to look at from the bed ahahah and you need to literally stand in front of it finally and the most important the room was cold and the heating system did not work the stuff suggested an mobile heater to be installed but the maintenance guy said they do not have one so we got a bit cold and we regretted we took this hotel i cannot imagine myself going there again
