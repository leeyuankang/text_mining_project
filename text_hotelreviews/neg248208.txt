huge mess up with the bill the reception charge your credit card with your room rate charges plus a percentage more on top in case you apparently break something or charge stuff to your room then when we checked out they charged the card again with charges for dinner drinks from someone elses room the bill is completely non sensical so my advise is check it before you check out
