where do i start no air in the room one small window overlooking the concrete shaft no minibar for that money i would expect a sauna in there no toilette on lobby area no sofas or chairs or anything on lobby area there is a restaurant behind the lobby but it does not belong to the hotel and it is embarrassing to seat and wait for example your taxi to the airport there also there is no breakfast exactly because the restaurant does not belong to the hotel
