the view we received from our room was not satisfying we overlooked a building site and it was a disappointment also the kettle in the room was faulty and dangerous it did not have an automatic cut out this meant the kettle over boiled and the button to turn it off manually heated up drastically as well as the rest of the appliance this should be looked at as someone could be hurt by this
