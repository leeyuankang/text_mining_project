we were unable to get our taxi to the door of the hotel on saturday october as northumberland street was closed to some traffic we were told there was a notice to this effect in our lift which we did not see there was no notice in our room on the reception desk or information from the receptionist when we asked if we could leave our bag your total lack of regard for older slightly infirm customers was very very disappointing
