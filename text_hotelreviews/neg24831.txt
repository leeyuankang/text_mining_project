the bed was broken and so uncomfortable the room was way too small there was no fridge the bath was tiny and the shower was terrible and very slow they didn t offer movie channels only offered free view tv which was very poor parking is very pricey unless on weekends when it s free there was no view just stuck in an end room with a view of a back road rooms very close together can hear other people in other rooms
