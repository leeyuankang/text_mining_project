though the room is rather big the comfort was poor i was very cold during my day stay tried to turn the heater on to no avail the device was capped at c and did not even warm up the room properly i woke up freezing both nights the bed sheets were thin the pillows very hard and thick not a great sleeping experience at all average staff attention some were more available than others the check in was endless for example could easily have been minutes
