i think their mattresses need to be replaced as they are over used and they need to supervise their cleaning staff as the room cleaness was not for a star hotel we had an unfortunate experience with our first room we were alocted to with the bathroom not being cleaned and the toilet being used and not flushed we did reported it and they apologized for it and we were relocated to a new cleaner room
