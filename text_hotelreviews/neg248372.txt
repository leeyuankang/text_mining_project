they gave me a room at level it was loud because of the tube passing just by the hotel i m really disappointed about it but since i ve been just one night and i was tired i didn t even go to the reception to tell them they shouldn t do this i also requested during my booking if i could have a room with a window giving on the main street and possibly with a bathtub a stars hotel surely does have it especially in january other than this the hotel is nice and the position is perfect
