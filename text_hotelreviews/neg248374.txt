i made this booking for my year old daughter and her two friends when my daughter checked into the hotel and wanted to pay her bill on arrival a member of staff at reception informed her she would also have to pay a deposit of which would be refunded on departure i was unaware of this deposit when i made the booking for her the member of staff checking her in then debited my daughter s account for the full cost of the booking twice by mistake it took from sunday to tuesday for the refund to go back into her account this left her short of cash while she was in london and very anxious about when the money would be refunded the hotel also debited her account for for the full cost of her stay a third time when she was checking out and again this took another two days to be refunded to her account i had to make a number of costly phone calls to the hotel to try to sort this error out and overall it caused a lot of stress to my daughter and to me though i dealt with a helpful member of staff at reception overall i found the whole situation very unsatisfactory i have used booking com for many years and never had any such problems with any of their other properties previously
