club quarters is a great example unfortunately for us where hotels do not take kindly to receiving families and or are unable to do so our room was at the far end of the hotel the heating does not work and the room was basic for the high price we paid also under the bed there was dirt from previous guests and last but by no means least after having had a very important item ordered online for delivery at the hotel and dully informed concierge services of this the night before to our absolute surprise the concierge did not accept the delivery and the item which we needed for the remainder of our holidays in europe was returned to sender i have a receipt from the provider saying the concierge denied delivery naturally we shall never stay at this hotel again and strongly advise all families to do the same
