room has disabled shower facility and the shower went everywhere as more of a wet room but the floor was soaked and puddled and could see where the water was soaking into the tiles as some movement was able to position the shower the next time but the shower curtain didn t stretch the whole way across and did not reach the floor so a mess was unavoidable
