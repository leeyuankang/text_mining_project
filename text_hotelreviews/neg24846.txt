the hotel that we booked as the regency hotel that we ve known for long had been bought and without our knowledge we came into a huge construction site i was told that within two weeks the hotel had to be updated with firedoors each floor was ripped up it was dusty and loud and the alarms went off while stressed out workers were sneaking under the your bed to hook up air condition leaking detectors or leaving heavy machinery on the floor in the hallway we were moved to a duplex but the furniture was worn and not very practical the one hing that pushed me over the edge was when it took them to react to my complains that the toilet seat wasn t clean as well as the coffe maker used with dirty water and missing supplies full of plaster fingerprints finally i got really upset when i noticed that the workers were allowed to enter the rooms withoutbsupervision while we were out with strange very unleasant things happening footprints and dust on the bed my clothes pushed to the side inside the closed the iron etc moved out and left coffee maker and toilet used and the small cosmetics gone from the bathroom i ve had smaller issues with room serice in the past but this time i had to virtually go to buy cleaning supplies and wipe the toiet also the much praised lounge was closed when supposed to be open and i ended up getting invited to help myself to fetch some water from the staff s recreation room in the basement also the old black and white printer in the office lounge was broken as well as the filty keybord of the antique pc didn t allow me to get my boarding pass printed and it took and hour to sort it out with the reception of course the apples are gone as well only the lovely reception staff remains and i hope the new owning hilton management will straighten things out and make badly nessacary investments
