the ice machine on my floor never worked and i stayed at least nights i had to go to another floor to get ice daily asked for non smoking room but upon getting there the first day it clearly smelled like someone previously had smoked and when i opened the curtain i literally saw a couple of cigarette buds on the outside windowsill i got a call about minutes prior to checking out asking when i was leaving if i stayed past that time i would be charged it was noon ish i have never had that happen to me even at much more expensive places i had even asked for a later checkout which again it was barely noon very unprofessional i would recommend this hotel if you want to be close to soho or covent garden but if you want a later checkout make sure you confirm the day before
