suzanna on reception seemed deliberately obstructive to letting us have an early check in other members of staff appeared to be afraid of her we re unable to help us in her wake i d called ahead to explain that we were in london taking part in a breast cancer charity s walk the walk moonwalk asked if an check in might be possible as we would have been walking through the night ready to drop we were assured that check in wouldn t be a problem suzanna however quite bluntly refused unless we were prepared to pay an extra for the privilege unfortunately we didn t have any extra funds so it wasn t even an option for us we d booked club quarters because it was relatively cheap if we d been able to spend more then we d have stayed somewhere better we then had to keep going back to reception to check whether any rooms had become available yet bearing in mind we d been awake on our feet all night we were dog tired by this time and really unhappy that no one thought to keep us informed while we waited for the regular check in time to come around i suspect that suzanna wouldn t allow any of the other staff to keep us informed even if they d wanted to we finally got a room at at extra so she did manage to get a little extra out of us in the end after all well done suzanna your customer service skills capacity for compassion do you credit not
