the hotel was in transition to becoming a doubletree we were not told at check in but we had to switch rooms during our stay due to construction staff was unhelpful with giving information and locating our luggage we had to store since we were taking tours during the day and needed to store our luggage because they couldn t get us another room until people checked out wasn t informed at booking that the hotel was going to be under construction not sure we would go back in the future since hilton took over they will probably increase the room prices and the renovated room they switched us to was fine for our price but not an increase
