we had a disastrous night got a morning call at for the wrong room no sooner got back asleep and the fire alarm went off a couple of times phoned reception during the alarm and got no reply so assumed this was an actual proper fire alarm everybody was out in the corridor we got dressed and followed them to reception the porter left us standing there as he proceeded to check out other guests eventually i interrupted to ask about the alarm while it was still going off and he just said he was busy checking out false alarm no explanation he could of at least put a sign up on the reception to say false alarm instead of leaving us stand there for at least mins guests were not at all pleased in our corridoor alarm went silent went back to bed and again it went off needless to say we got no more sleep so much for a relaxation stay the next morning on checkout no apologies or explanation the room was too hot our first night on returning back to the room there was a septic smell from the drains as we had left the bathroom door open and the fan was off the second night we made sure to turn off the heating and keep the bathroom door closed the room was clean though and the proximity of the hotel made up for it so if the management could improve on these problems along with a the night porters politeness i would rate the hotel
