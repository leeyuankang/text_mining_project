i was unaware the hotel had changed hands in october until i received an e mail from booking com the day before our visit not sure who was at fault booking com or the hotel for that one i had booked a club suite in june as a special treat we arrived at the hotel early so booked in stored our luggage and went out for a while we returned later to get our key and were given our room number we went to the room to find that instead of the suite we had booked we had been given one of the smaller rooms in the hotel when we returned to reception and spoke to the manager he told us that the room was being worked on and that we couldn t have it none of this had been said either before our visit via e mail to booking com who had my details nor during the booking in process or when we collected our key despite the fact that the receptionist had the booking details in front of her printed from my computer at the time of booking us in it felt like it wasn t important and that they hoped we would just accept it and not complain as a result of our complaint we were given a discount on the room initially this did put a damper on the weekend and had there been an option we may well have left having said all this as indicated above we were not unhappy with the service the hotel provided my issue is with the communication and lack of understanding of the effect their actions regarding the room change had on what should have been a special weekend if we return there in the future i will certainly be checking we get what we ordered
