we had an awful experience at this hotel we had booked the duplex suite however on check in we were told we weren t able to have this room because it wasn t available why let somebody book a room that is unavailable we were offered discount and an alternative room but as we had booked the top room this room didn t match up to our expectations we were not told before arriving it wasn t advised on the hotel website that on the day we were booked in to stay the hotel brand would be changing to doubletree by hilton the staff were all over the place and didn t have a clue what they were doing throughout our whole stay it also felt as though the general manager was unable to actually help us and just kept repeating that it was due to the brand swap and next time we will have an enjoyable stay this may sound petty but i know it bothers a lot of women i know when staying in hotels the mirror at the dressing table is quite high in comparison with the low seat to do your hair make up due to the inconvenience at check in we then didn t have enough time to grab some dinner before going to a show we had booked we stayed in covent garden for a couple of drinks before heading back to order room service which we had seen on the hour menu in our room when calling reception room service was unavailable because of the hotel brand swap why put menu s in rooms therefore we didn t eat at all as it was too late to go anywhere else after complaining about the room service scenario we were offered either a bottle of champagne in the room or a two course meal we took the champagne offer after seeing the restaurant the evening before didn t fancy sitting in an empty restaurant with zero atmosphere they then said they didn t have any so we got a cheap bottle of white wine
