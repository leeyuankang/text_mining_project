the rooms are very small and you can hear every breath if someone walks in the corridor it feels as if they are in your room there is massive constructing going on which we were not told about prior to booking the hallways are filled with workers wifi in the room didn t work there was an xmas party going on until with drunk people running through the hallways and the base and music irritating anyone who wanted to sleep after several requests nothing was done wouldn t recommend staying there
