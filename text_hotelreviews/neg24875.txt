the room was small especially the bathroom which could only just about fit one person in my partner is and only just fitted under the shower the room had some unfinished aspects for example wall sockets have been removed leaving behind undecorated square patches the most annoying aspect of the room however was if you turned on the bathroom light a large light in the bedroom then came on which couldn t be turned off very frustrating in the middle of the night and you are woken by it
