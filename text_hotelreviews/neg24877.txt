sadly the hotel was let down by the male staff in the main entrance concierge and reception there were no smiles or greetings from them and in fact we had to smile or talk first before even getting a response all three men we encountered seemed less than happy to be there the female staff were a lot more friendly the beds were the most uncomfortable i have ever encountered with my mattress sloping to one side and no springiness at all there is also a ridiculous lighting system in the room when the bathroom light is turned on the light by the door and also a main bedroom light also switch on you can imagine in the middle of the night when one of you goes to the loo and the whole room lights up worst of all is you can t turn them off i called reception and was told the lights are connected and on a timer so you just have to wait for them to turn off by this point though you are both wide awake someone has to change this as i ve never seen anything like it also the fire alarm went off in the morning as we were getting up but we weren t told there would be a drill
