the booking was done for deluxe double room and from i called them ahead to tell them i will be checking only on morning i land up to find the reservation was on hold even though they had charged me on the previous day itself once it got unblocked they provided me a compact room where if you walk you will hit a wall when i enquired about the same the staff was unapologetic and started explaining how the victorian buildings tend to become smaller on higher floors when i was not buying the story they provided me the actual deluxe double room that is more comfy the staffs arrogance and lack of coordination is seriously needs to be looked at during all these commotion that manager didn t even bother to come out from his palace
