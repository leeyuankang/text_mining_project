the breakfast was the normal buffet fair with rubbery scrambled eggs and shoe leather bacon all for the very reasonable i was staying at the hotel due to its proximity to the royal marsden as my wife was having a serious operation i had booked nights stay while my wife was to be in critical care unit on the saturday it was clear she would be staying another night so i booked another night i was preoccupied and tired with the stress of my wife s situation i assumed it would be at the same rate as i had paid through booking com when i checked i had been charged which more than the previous nights i checked on booking com for their rate which was when i pointed this out the recepyion staff shrugged their shoulders i had been charged the hotel full rate and she would not consider reducing the price i was too tired and preoccupied to put up a fight at the time as i wanted to see my wife this left a disagreeable taste in the mouth and i would not recommend the regency to anyone i know
