there were a number of problems with my room my room was in the basement and there were water pipes from other rooms which made quite a loud noise throughout the night which was disturbing i noticed there were earplugs in the bathroom and see there have been other reviews eg on tripadvisor complaining about this there was urine in the toilet when i arrived which was disgusting the rest of the room was spotlessly clean i suspect someone had checked in and been moved to another room although the room did have a window and natural light but it was immediately below the pavement on the street above not great but main problem was they didn t inform me this would be the case when i booked my room was definitely not star and not worth the high price i paid for it when i politely discussed all the above with the manager in the morning he offered to upgrade me on my next stay but i don t think that was a sufficient response to the above problems
