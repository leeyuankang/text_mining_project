everything was lovely but the staff which made me feel like i was bothering them all the time they would hardly look up when you walk in from street no greetings hardly a salutation and the same thing going out it felt a bit like all the staff was down and unaccessible to clients hardly any eye contact or human connection which at the end of the day is so cheap but most comforting in a foreign city small boutique hotel with quirky design but i doubt i d come back due to the unfriendly greetings i also had the terrible surprise that there was no shower tray in the bathroom just a simple shower curtain in one corner of bathroom awful
