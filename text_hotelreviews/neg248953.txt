they haven t maintained the overall experience it was very clunky compared to our first visit which was fab this one was disappointing having booked rooms and one with an extra bed same as our last trip and been in communication with the hotel during this time to arrive late with tired children and with staff with no knowledge of this was annoying rooms was ok with light the other was dingey at the back noisy at night no interconnecting rooms for gbp a night for the triple and for the double i won t go back on top of this i ordered breakfast dishes of the a la carte they delivered it to me and charged me for breakfasts total cost i asked them to recalculate it according to the menu it came to the tv and aircon were problematic didn t work dodgey dial also when i enquired about a babysitter the cost was per hour normal rates are plus overall didn t meet my needs i have recommended the place over the last year to several friends but they need to work on their seamless customer experience and i need to manage my friends expectations the staff were kind friendly and attentive but still couldn t pull out the x factor nor overcome these problems disappointing stay for for nights we can do much better
