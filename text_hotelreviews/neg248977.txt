the food was basic and overpriced and the restaurant area tiny dark and uncomfortable in the room automatic lights follow you around which is amusing to begin with and then irritating the door rattled so i had to wedge paper in the gap the bathroom fan would not turn off at night and had a persistent hum heating aircon was difficult to get right checkout was slow all in all not really worth the price
