we had a room in the basement so we had no view and there was a very slight damp smell in the bathroom the tap in the bathroom was lose and the shower drained away very slowly we also thought the big bar costs in our room were rather pricy apart from this absolutely no complaints and i would definitely highly recommend the hotel
