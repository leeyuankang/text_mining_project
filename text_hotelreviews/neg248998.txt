as a frequent international business traveller i get to spend around nights per year in hotels i prefer boutique hotels as i like the look and feel of it plus prefer to sponsor smes rather than big multinational hotel chains looking on booking i was quite excited about staying at the laslett when arriving to the place the room however was a disaster even my dorm room at university back in the was more luxurious first of all it was celsius when i arrived in london and got a tiny south facing room with no airco it was around in my room i mean which star hotel does not have airco afterwards i checked my booking and indeed there was no mentioning of airco but seriously when booking a or star it s logic that there are some basics like airco wifi etc i mean we are people plus you pay around euro for a room without breakfast besides the airco my dorm room was not that boutique at all some cheap grey carpet ikea style furniture a single bed bathroom of m with the shower right next to the toilet without any separation quite disgusting if you ask me see pics attached also service wise this place also has nothing to do with a star very young and unexperienced staff had to wait minutes to get slices of bread at breakfast embarrassingly too informal conversation with the guy bringing up my luggage the guy delivering room service to some people standing with me in the elevator telling that he would like to eat the meal etc etc student style service therefore again youth hostel star hotel duhhh
