very poor room layout and general quality of installation e g our balcony door was broken and wouldn t close all the way so there was a cold breeze the toilet flush kept sticking towel warmer not working some peeling signage artwork hung unevenly poor soundproofing room layout cramped and illogical made even more so by an unnecessary wall that takes up limited space and separates the bed from the window if there must be a wall it should separate the bed from the door not the other way around some of this is no doubt corrected in the larger suite rooms disappointed in the food dinner essentially amounted to pieces of toast have never had bread for dipping in olive oil actually be just pieces of toast and i was surprised that the pastries the next morning were dry and a bit stale especially since they were supposed to be from sally clarke who is always unfailingly excellent so it did make me wonder if they were from the day before
