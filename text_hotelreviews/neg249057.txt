i was looking to treat myself at the laslett after a tiring work trip i was in for a big disappointment i was first given a room with no air conditioning that was unacceptably hot and stuffy room at first the staff proposed to move me to a new room however i would have had to pay an additional pound per night fee after an amount of awkward negotiation they agreed to provide an airconditioned room at no extra charge room unfortunately this room was on the basement level so i could hear every footstep from the floor above breakfast room reception etc i was really looking forward to my stay at the laslett given other reviews but i found the service and quality of the rooms i stayed in wanting while there were some staff were lovely there were others who were inexplicably snobby
