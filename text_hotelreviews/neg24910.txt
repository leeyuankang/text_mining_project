the staff wasn t the friendliest i have encountered they were not very personable but more like robots one morning we had only hot or scalding water coming out of the tap as mentioned by another reviewer we also lost wifi for several hours and had a false fire alarm at am which was frightening the room was extremely small club twin as was the bathroom it was quite overpriced for the size of the room
