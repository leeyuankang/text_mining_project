my card was used to charge another guests costs which typifies the lackasadaisical poorly trained staff after all the stress they caused using my card no letter of apology was sent they seemed to think returning money to my card was sufficient apology also the cost of stay there is not justified by littering the rooms with pseudo art and discontinued neal s yard toiletries the only knowledgeable and professional staff was the doorman every one else seemed to be so filled with their own self importance was glad after night to go back to my fave hilton around the corner clean efficient and honest staff who are like old friends would recommend other hotels or even b b to the laslett much ado about nothing
