i found the staff seemed badly trained unable to deal with the simplest request booked the hotel for nights and every breakfast was a nightmare the first day it took nearly min to be served and the waiter kept on making mistakes on my order another think i didn t like is the reception area and restaurant they are so small it feels like a waiting room the aisle to the rooms is very narrow
