breakfast you must buy every item separately but although the hotel is not able to offer normal things like sliced cheese and eggs not even boiled not a proper room for breakfast service incredible slow impression that they don t want guest having breakfast there staff very keen to pay everything right now f e had to pay for full stay one week at arrival plus deposit minibar was kind of funny situation not very friendly and not service orientated seemed to be not good organized
