i booked the hotel for an artist who flew overnight from canada on her arrival she found out that the hotel was semi finished and opened only weeks ago many things were not working at all or properly like wi fi which was vital for her at this time the sockets in the room the lifts and a few other things it was very wrong fro a hotel to open its doors to clients unfinished and particularly not let clients know in advance that that was the case
