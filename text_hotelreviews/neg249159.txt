really disappointed with this hotel i booked a famiy room for my brother his wife and two young kids while booking i submitted a special request to see if they could check in slightly earlier i would have been happy to pay extra for this however they did not even bother responding when my brother and his family arrived on the day they also requested an early check in but were advised that the earliest they can check in was at which was the standard time anyway they went out to kill time and came back just before pm they were then told to wait minutes as the room wasn t ready yet these minutes became and eventually they didn t get their room till pm absolute disgrace by this point his young kids who were already exhausted coming via an early morning flight were completely shattered and every minute felt like an hour very very disappointed especially because this was the first experience my brother and his family had in europe and it was very unpleasant because of the customer service at this hotel
