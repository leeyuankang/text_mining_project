we arrived late evening and finding the location was a pain due to outdated google map entry the taxi driver had to take two different routes to drop us off upon arrival there was no porter and a single lady on the reception and i had to carry all my luggage personally while i was provided with hot kettle in my room i noticed other rooms had nescafe dulce gusto machines again no complimentary water definitely not worth the money charged
