we had booked the mulin rouge show with tbe reception and they failed to tell us that the men had to wear long trousers we arrived at the show dressed nicely but the men were in nice bermuda and long sleeve shirts but we were denied entry it was our last night and a very big pity since it was something we really wished to see souviner shops next to the show sell long trousers but we did not see it being hygienic
