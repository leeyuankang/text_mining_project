overall whilst this hotel is excellent we were left disappointed by our room and the late check in by rude staff by way of explanation we were unable to check in to our room until despite arriving well after the check in time if staff offered no apology or explanation other than cleaning running behind on heading to our room a level room we found a very tired unrenovated room not reflective at all of the photos on this website or those given to my brother also staying at the hotel on a substantially lower room rate too the room lacked basic features e g the air conditioning did not work effectively the bathroom door did not lock poor tea and coffee facilities in this regard the room didn t have sufficient tea coffee or milk teabag is not sufficient and when we requested extra tea bags staff were dismissive and incredibly rude the first person asked gave us one extra teabag and then demanded a tip we ended up buying our own teabags and milk truly novotel what was also disappointing was that when asked why our room was not the quality as given to my brother or per the website photos the desk staff said that all family rooms were of that standard sorry novotel don t treat me as stupid why not an honest answer that level was not renovated your check in process and rude front desk team let down the rest of our experience
