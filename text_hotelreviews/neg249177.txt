access to the building due to construction that i was not aware of made the experience less than ideal i expect that typically the hotel has an ideal location on a pretty courtyard the construction will likely be done by september however this is clearly beyond the hotels control for those visiting the construction did not hinder the experience within the hotel itself there was not added noise from our room and overall the conditions were very conducive for sleeping with comfortable beds and a quiet setting
