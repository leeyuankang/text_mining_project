the construction was a total mess and there was no way to get to the hotel by taxi without a lot of confusion once we found it they did call all taxis for us from then on they use a local taxi company and all the drivers were fabulous well dressed beautiful vehicles and knew how to find the hotel the restaurant was not great at night the waitresses did not speak english and were a little rude
