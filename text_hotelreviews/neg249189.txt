the square in front of the hotel is undergoing construction think it is scheduled to be completed spring consequently it was a bit confusing to navigate but i would definitely stay there again combination of superb location between the marais and louvre wonderfully designed brand new room and helpful staff we didn t get to dine there so many wonderful options in the neighborhood
