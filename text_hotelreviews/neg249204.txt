not the fault of the hotel but there is big construction project going on right outside of the hotel we were there during a holiday weekend so it wasn t very loud but i imagine that during a regular work week there woukd be much more noise also due to the construction there are a few little streets blocked off so you have to make small detours if carrying lots of luggage or small children be aware
