construction is still going on so depending upon where your room is it can be very loud and intruding i booked this hotel in order to have reliable speedy wifi and a quiet accommodation in order to handle a few conference calls via skype while in paris so the construction noise was a bit frustrating when i let the staff know my concerns they offered a conference room in the business center and assured me the noise would stop after pm my calls were on ny time so this worked out perfectly and all was fine
