there is no parking unless you arrive by public transportation or with little to no luggage i do not recommend this property there is an agreement with a third party parking blocks away which solves the problem for the car but carrying luggage on the streets in this particular neighborhood is not a pleasant experience management should make this very clear when advertising this hotel at least to give people a choice it was very frustrating to find it out only when we arrived there was intense noise coming from construction work happening inside the hotel every morning it was very loud and made the room useless in the morning one couldn t sleep nor work due to the noise of walls being drilled constantly getting to the hotel by car is a nightmare several streets are closed due to construction works and there is no area for passenger drop off once you give up and park anywhere you can locating the hotel on foot is not difficult but you are likely to see the back of the building first from there the location of the reception is not very well signed and the alley yes alley leading to it is poorly lit and not properly signaled other problems are beyond reach for management but they affect our experience as guests the area around the hotel is a massive construction site noise wasn t a problem but circulation both on foot and by car is complicated and unpleasant moreover being a very central area you are close to main attractions and shops but the area isn t particularly safe nor nice after dark the whole area around the hotel stenches to urine when you walk out of the reception you have the impression that you entered a chemical toilette
