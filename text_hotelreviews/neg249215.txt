when we entered the room there was a very strong smell of sweat like after an intense gym session we had to wide open the windows and ask the personnel of the floor to spray the room it makes you wonder the cleanliness of the room and how come the cleaning personnel did not realize this second no one told us that there were works in the hotel very annoying when you are on holidays to be awaken at by loud noise same in the afternoon when trying to take a nap after a long day outside also there were issues with the quality of the tv signal pixelized images etc finally on the check out when we mentioned the issues the person was unapologetic incapable of handling a phone call a check out and a customer complaining did not even offer a commercial gesture for all these disagreements this is our place of choice when we stay in paris but this time our opinion of the stay rates very low
