upon arriving i properly queued as any decent human being to checkin however the receptionist approached the guy behind me who was caucasian to checkin him first this i perceived was very racist for him to do since i was first on the line and i am the lone asian since the guy behind me knew i came before him he told the receptionist off faith in humanity restored much to my dismay the receptionist was exceptionally rude while checking me in he was very dismissive and did not even want to look over my reservation confirmation it was our first time in paris and we were off to a terrible start
