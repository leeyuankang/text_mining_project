the rooms were extremely small you could hardly walk around the furnitures the standard room were no where near a star hotel i had to pay for upgrade to executive room to get something decent still very small though didn t worth euros per night i phoned to get a slipper i was told i had to go down to reception to get it because they are busy location is in a very busy area with lots of construction happening around the hotel the taxi can t drop you by the hotel you need to walk abit with a baby and a pushchair it is not something you looking for i would not recommend this hotel if you going to pay euros you can find much better hotels in paris
