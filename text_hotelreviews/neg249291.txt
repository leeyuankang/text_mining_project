i didn t like the fact that i was placed in a room with very old carpet poor shower facilities and one which had no view i stayed at a budget hotel the previous two days for less than half the price with better bathroom facilities and views it wasn t until i complained and compared my room to that of my cousin who was staying at the same hotel for a similar price that i was transferred to another room the initial advisor refused to change the rooms when the manager over heard she changed my room when i got to this room i had to request for all the additional facilities to be put in place is bathrobe slippers which i expected would be ready for me with the transfer
