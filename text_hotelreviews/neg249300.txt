the hotel does not provide the basic supplements including but not limited to comb toothbrush etc also the staff is very unhelpful and their guidance or have given me wrong instructions on items such as wifi as a result i was suffering from a extremely slow wifi for a prolonged period last but not least i request the email alternative channel and this request has been refused by the staff as well overall it has been a very disappointed experience and i highly appreciate you should think twice or even thrice before book this hotel
