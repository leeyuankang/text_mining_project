i was very impressed overall there was a small little issue of seeing a mouse in the hotel bar on sunday evening but i didn t want to make a fuss as to upset other quests looking back i should of told one of the staff but it was a little mouse he could of got in anywhere and the hotel was so clean that i didn t think for one second there was a problem overall
