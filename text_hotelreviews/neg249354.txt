i was extremely offended by a gentleman that claimed to be the manager of the dining room on the day we were checking out i stood in line for quite a while to get a table my husband was finishing up packing and i went to dine alone i was seated by a gentleman and went to get my breakfast when i returned a lady claimed i took her seat i figured it was a mix up because i was just seated the gentleman in question then makes a scene and dismisses me back to the reception area as if i did something wrong he didn t even offer to re seat me listen to me or move my plate i was humiliated and embarrassed and left the dining area in tears the kind hostess and the gentleman that told me he was the customer service manager mr wendy i believe that originally seated me came to my rescue and tried to make up for the rudeness of the supposed manager and offered to serve me breakfast in the bar area they acknowledged that he was wrong and even though it was a mix up he could have handled the situation differently i was inconsolable and mortified this gentleman was rude the morning before as well i was meeting my husband who was seated in the dining room and i explained this to him and he dismissed me to the end of the line without listening not sure what kind of customer service you expect but i have been in the hospitality industry all of my career and i would never treat someone that way and i surely never expected as a grown woman i would be treated that way i had always heard the stereotype of parisians but up until that incident my trip to paris was lovely i will surely not return to this hotel again and will not recommend to friends i will also send a letter to accor corporate office and let them know about the service of this dining room manager at the les halles location
