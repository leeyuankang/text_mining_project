the room was very small quite dark and and drab the floor hadn t been vacuumed well and was frankly dirty and there was someone else s hair in the shower the rubber seal had come away from shower door and was very obviously hanging off nobody made an attempt to repair it during my stay not a surprise as there was no evidence of cleaning during my trip the toilet seat was too small for the bowl or was not fitted correctly so you end up sitting partially on the rim of the actually toilet utterly gross no complimentary toiletries such as cotton buds nail file body lotion which you would certainly expect at this price range i don t mind basic although expensive for this standard but cleanliness is a must therefore would not recommend
