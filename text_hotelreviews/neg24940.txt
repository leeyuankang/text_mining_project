because i had a screen shot that said free wiki they didn t charge me the per day when it didn t work in my room when i wanted to change my airline reservation they didn t have any computers to accommodate guests and that there was probably something wrong with my cell phone i was told he was yelling and surly toward me with his french accent at one point when i was obviously upset there i was in my pajamas in the lobby of the regency hotel because it was now and he refused to come to my room to configure my cell while in the lobby my cell miraculously worked on checking out the receptionist asked if my stay was pleasant just then another guest complained his wifi was also not working
