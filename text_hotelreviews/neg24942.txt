we originally booked the hotel because of the location and being very close to south kensington station the rooms are old and outdated and the hotel needs a bit of love and care when we booked we advised that we had a year old baby and requested a cot on arrival we were given a room on the second floor while there is a lift to the first floor we then had to work our way up to the second about stairs with a pram not ideal and should have been considered when organising us a room the hotel also has stairs into the lobby i can recall about or times that i walked into the hotel with the staff standing behind the desk and watching me struggle to get the pram and baby up the stairs staff in general weren t overly helpful and really quite miserable room was average but definitely not well thought out or planned small space under the bed but can t even fit a suitcase for example new showers in the bathroom but very little pressure i understand london is expensive and you don t get a lot for your money but i definitely expected a lot more i wouldn t stay here again
