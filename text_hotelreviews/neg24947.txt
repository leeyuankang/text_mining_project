the value for the money is just not there you re paying for the location which for some will be worth it the staff seemed like they thought they were doing you a favor by being there the room had some pretty major issues for people less easy going than we are the wall unit a c consistently made noise varying from a rattle to a loud bang some of the outlets were broken and there was next to no space for clothing to be outside of your suitcase i will say this we didn t eat there so we can t judge that but with the area there s no reason to eat in the hotel and for women or men with long hair bring your own conditioner they use that body hair everything soap which never feels like it s doing anything
