my stay was very unpleasant the air conditioner was making horrible noise and was not working properly and i had to change the room the next day however the ac was still not working properly in addition the mattress and the pillows were not comfortable at all the staff reaction to the ac issue was not satisfying they even did not apologise to the horrible experience i went through this stay is the worst experience i ever had in london
