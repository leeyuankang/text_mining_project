the front desk failed to send a guest to the restaurant when we specifically asked and gave them a note to do so when she arrived caused a lot of anxiety for her and us also we returned from dinner to find a very strong smell of cigarette smoke in our room made us concerned as to who might have been in there mgr apologized and assured us the property was totally non smoking not sure where the odor came from
