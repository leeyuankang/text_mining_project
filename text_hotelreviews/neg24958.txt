there was no washing facilities e g small toiletries the room did get rather warm at night also it seem to be quite nosey in the corridors could always hear doors banging people walking up and down etc maybe a little over priced the bathroom was very small which may effect some people but wasn t a problem for me there s nothing that would stop me staying here again
