in general room and breakfast too expensive for what you get i guess you pay extra for the location bathroom was very small and room too hot the main problem was the noise we unfortunately had a room with a connecting door very poor sound isolation through the connection door we could hear every word our neighbors were saying which was particularly annoying since they stayed up until the middle of the night i think this is only a problem in the rooms with connecting doors since we didn t hear any of our other neighbors my advise would be to ask a room without connecting doors
