i didn t appreciate how they trick us into getting the attic of the hotel i booked a suite and they give me the worst one i should have been more selective and never approve on getting that room we have to bend because letterly we were at the attic and when it was raining we hear the rain like we were sleeping in a tin can the bed was so in comfortable and the breakfast buffet need to be better the coffee for example is tasteless the front desk were very helpful during our stay but when i ask about the sports channel i expect an answer other than i m alone at the desk i can t help you with anything
