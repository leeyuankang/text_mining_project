on booking i paid for breakfast but it did not say it was just for a continental breakfast so like many other visitors who thought the same as ourselves we walked to the breakfast room and told to go back up a tight hallway past the gym and find a room where we were to have our meal the breakfast was pure misery of pickings of fruit with no taste yoghurt thick with watery whey on the surface coffee was bleak and croissants that needed butter but none to be found
