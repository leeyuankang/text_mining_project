everything really the staff is unprepared to deal with the customer when i arrived i thought i would enjoy my day in the hotel but it was quit the opposite i felt a bit uncomfortable when the guy carrying our bags went inside the room without even asking but ok nothing unusual there i was awake since so i decided to take a nap before going to the event i needed to attend that day unfortunately after a minute or inside the room i realised i could hear every single door in the hotel being shut down and every person on the corridor that started to annoy but i was so tired that i tried to sleep anyways after minutes i was so frustrated with the doors banging every minutes that i called reception to complain and inform i could hear everything outside the room the receptionist was incredible rude and told the hotel is like that he said there was nothing he could do he had the courage to say if there was guests talking at the corridor he could not remove them from there but my point was not that i was irritated that the hotel has no soundproofing i expect at least a minimum of privacy so i can sleep while on the phone i also informed the receptionist that one of the light bulbs inside the room was flicking uncontrollably and i needed someone to come over and have a look he told me he would send someone from maintenance this was around by i started to prepare myself for my event and no sign of anybody coming to check the light i called once again and this time another receptionist told me they would send someone to check another minutes and not even a call to let us know the maintained was busy so i call again to inform i will need to leave the hotel and no sign of anybody coming to the room she then promised again to send someone quickly and i also asked for an iron this time took a good for housekeeping to come in and bring complimentary bottle of water
