they have members of staff working as management as waiters as bell boys as everything in a hotel that has no food no spa facilities no customer care and their prices are more expensive then four seasons i only stayed there because everyone else was fully booked in paris at night i was unable to get back into the hotel as the night staff one person was somewhere sleeping and not able to hear us ringing the bell thank god we had batteries on our uk numbers to call and inform the staff memeber we are outside trying to get inside we asked for a later check out with the night staff and he was very rude and not willing to help telling us nothing to do with him we have to speak to the day staff at they called us from the reception asking us to leave and i explained that we need additional hours to pack and order food and then check out and we were ready to pay for those two hours but also explained that in less then hours they have treated us as they are the guests and us working for them and not giving a moment to relax and enjoy the room that we paid for for one night we were finally given a later check out and we came down at and we re present with a bill for late checkout imagine the shock until i argued how these people are simply robbing people blind one of the staff members said he would void that transaction and we left two days later i find out that the hotel took out of my account without my knowledge i called them and they said they don t know and their manager will call and speak to me no body ever called me i called my bank and booking com and the same thing they told me regarding a manager calling back no one has called them back either i regret not getting the police involved when i was there as this would have never happened this hotel is run by crooks and unprofessional staff please be careful what you are
