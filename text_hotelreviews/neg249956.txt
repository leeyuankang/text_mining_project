the hotel seems to be a little rundown as far as maintenance it almost did not feel like a star hotel the lobby is not very inviting nor beautiful the design by christian lacroix makes it interesting but yet its still lacks luxury they definitely had a great photographer because unfortunately the hotel did not look like in the photos breakfast was expensive
