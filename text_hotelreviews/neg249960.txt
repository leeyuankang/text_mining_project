while the room was gorgeous the mattress was broken down on the first night after a long day of business meetings got back to the room and collapsed in bed only to wake up a couple of hours later with severe pain in the hip eventually i found one part of the mattress that wasn t totally broken down and managed to sleep through the night in a similar vein visually the bathroom was beautiful but the shower was designed by someone with a wonderful design aesthetic but no concept of practical use
