very poor value for money the rooms are tiny i know it is paris but for less than what i paid i had a room in another lovely hotel in the area last week that was twice the size and more beautifully decorated with working a c music and a nespresso maker in the room my a c did not work properly the photos on booking com don t demonstrate just how small the room i had was i couldn t open my medium size suitcase except on the bed only my carry on i don t know how people would fit in the room the hotel charged euro for a nespresso i think that is correct where as everywhere i have stayed in europe including airbnbs in the last weeks had nespresso makers with complementary coffee
