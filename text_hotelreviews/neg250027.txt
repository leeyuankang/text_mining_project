due to the extremely small size of the room we felt claustrophobic the microscopic elevator left from the floor shower over very high lipped but very small bath quite dangerous to egress impossible to get water on you from the showerhead needs to be changed no lunch or dinner served in the hotel wi fi did not work in our room only english tv stations available were news stations view from room was terrible very expensive due to the above we booked a club room and paid over per night
