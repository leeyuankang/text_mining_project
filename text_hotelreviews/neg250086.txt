there are two issues that surprised me and that could be worked on to make the hotel perfect the wifi connection is too weak the staff tried to work on it and it improved slightly but not really i had to use my data connection via my sim card for what s app hence free wifi was simply not true this is a common issue in many smaller hotels who need to accommodate their data connection needs between an everyday household system and a professional and costly set up with their own servers while i understand that decent bandwidth does cost something i expect that from a hotel at this price at least what s app emails and written news have to run without delay i had a single room with a french bed the bed had two mattresses making it impossible to lie comfortably in the middle of it at this standard i would expect one mattress otherwise the bed was very comfortable but i would have wished to have more space again particularly at this price
