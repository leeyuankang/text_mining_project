room was a bit tired the air unit or heater or whatever buzzed all night which was very annoying and storage closet space was limited london itself has become a tarpit foul air congestion and everything and i mean everything is so grossly overpriced the city probably tainted my view on the hotel somewhat but i will never visit london again other than perhaps in transit to somewhere more pleasant
