not a bunch of friendly desk staff don t they know how to smile when checked in i was informed my booking included breakfast which i knew already when i ve booked in advance breakfast time location of the room should be informed upon arrival without having to ask for that information wifi is available had to ask for that information too not impressed with their service however the concierge who does not speak english male housekeeper who does speak english sorry don t know their names were very helpful thank you gentlemen we were thirsty on arrival the hotel so had to buy water shocked to find for a very small bottle of water so over priced so beware asked for the nearest supermarket was told the name of the street however not given a good direction map of the city is not available the desk so be prepared to have the map in hand before travelling to paris the only reason i would go back to this hotel would be the location of the property
