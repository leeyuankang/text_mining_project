the hotel is stars but rated i believe in or as now in it would be rated star all rooms facilities are out dated you can see it in the lobby as they still hang the usd french frank conversation rate our room had the safety deposit box not working and when we complained they said the hotel manager will come at pm they said we can put our stuff in the lobby and have to sign a paper that is in french saying it s under our responsibility how can it be under our responsibility when the safety deposit box in the room dosent work if you don t mind the above and look for the location only then i would recommend other then that you can find better hotels with better facilities not booking again
