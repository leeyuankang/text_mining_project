my room smelled strongly to cigarretes even though it was supposed to be non smoking aditionally it was facing the street which doesn t have a heavy traffic but the lack of isolation makes you hear each and every car passing by i realize that hotels in paris are expensive but in my view you can find better value for money i was told the first day that the hotel was fuli so i did not try to change rooms i just lived with it
