at the front desk there was one person that was really not helpful she even told me i should not have booked through your site and that was why the room was not ready for the early check in i had asked for she had us waiting for mintutes at the reception to know if the room was ready there was another person with her and she knew i had a business meeting to go to but i needed to change clothes before i had just travelled there was a third person there the groom he got impatient for us and just opened a door and told the person at the reception the room was not ready yes our bedroom was just next to the front desk but the woman there did want us to sit there and wait made me really upset i had to get changed in the restaurant next to the fron desk where other people where waiting too my problem is that she should have just done her job and go check for me as our bedroom was just next to the front desk i lost minutes and was late to my business meeting on the other hand another person at the front desk manager was very kind and gave us a discount for the discomfort in the end of the stay i have mixed feelings about this hotel
