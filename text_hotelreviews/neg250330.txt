i felt like i was in the siberian annex with a strange passageway to get to elevator also they closed their restaurant bar on a friday holiday which seemed weird since it s a hotel most everything else in paris was open rooms a little too minimal zero on the walls and bathroom didn t even have a towel rack so i couldn t be very earth friendly with wet towels its not the end of the world but those little things count at their price point and for those who travel a lot
