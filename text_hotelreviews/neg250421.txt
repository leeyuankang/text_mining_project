floors creak doors don t shut easily our bathroom door didn t close at all no water connection in the separate toilet in the suite guess the french don t wash hands after a loo break the courtyard which is advertised on the site is only accessible fr behind the reception the door is closed and noone really used it while we were there so don t feel awkward just ask to use it like we finally did as its really cute a mini fridge in the room wd be nice as i cant imagine the room in summer without cold water to drink
