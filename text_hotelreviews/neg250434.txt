the heating system of this hotel was not working and our stay became very uncomfortable as a result we told the front desk staff about it several times and the only thing they ever did was providing additional blankets we still paid the full price at the end despite this major issue i caught a cold during my stay in this hotel and am still dealing with it if the heating system of a hotel is not working and they know about it they should let the guests in advance and booking com should remove it from the list of amenities of this hotel this heating issue definitely requires further investigation in my opinion this hotel should be rated much lower than its current rating i would not call this hotel excellent under any circumstances
