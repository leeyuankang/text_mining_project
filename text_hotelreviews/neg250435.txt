they could have refilled the coffee capsules daily instead of only provided on the first day i stayed for days and the coffee machine was only used on what a waste i know i could buy them from the reception at each but i also don t think it costs the hotel much to supple customers a daily dose of capsules after all we do pay the same rate daily so why not the same care and service
