disappointing experience the hotel has physical keys for the rooms they require you to give the front desk the key before leaving every day upon check in the front desk associate told me the wrong room and gave me the corresponding key i walked into someone else s room with all of their personal belongings out and exposed additionally i came back on separate evenings to my room unlocked after it was cleaned i expressed my concern to the front desk and she disregarded my complaint as a solo female traveler i felt uncomfortable with how casual they were with security i went downstairs at night to find the front desk man sleeping on the couch there were some great associates who were polite and helpful but overall the staff just lacked professionalism
