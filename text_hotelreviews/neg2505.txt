i was expecting a delivery at the reception and despite having a confirmation of the delivery the night staff refused to give it to me arguing that it has never been delivered it is only when i ve threatened them to call the police that my package suddenly reappeared without the slightest apology outrageous i strongly advise you to chose another hotel if you have any concern for your belongings
