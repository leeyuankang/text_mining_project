only issue was on last night when the occupants of room above were moving about a lot in the night and disturbed my wife s sleep suspect it was noisy due to laminate floors and lack of noise insulation below the top surface or ceiling of room to dampen the sound not entirely hotel fault as cannot control guests nocturnal movements and they were not being loud and rowdy in any way but perhaps had a middle of the night start consider we were unlucky to have those guests above us for that night and it would not put us off returning another time
