we stayed here last year for new year and it was fabulous hence our return for this years celebration unfortunately it wasn t as good our first night dec fire alarm went off at am not one member of staff met us at the stairs another guest informed us it was a false alarm had it been for real i m not sure we d have been directed safely out of the building we got no apologies for our trauma we stayed another night dec spent the evening with family and watched the fireworks got back about pm and ready to sleep no chance one of the rooms had a party eventually the noise stopped but resumed at in the morning so we got very little sleep even though its was new year i would of expected the hotel to ask them very quickly to have some respect for other residents
