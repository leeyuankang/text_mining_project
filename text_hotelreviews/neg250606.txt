after checking in which was nice and swift we went to put our luggage in the room and found the cleaner in it who said she was just checking it we had just seen her in reception the bedcover had a couple of dirty marks on it we informed reception and it was changed small room and the bathroom was tiny although the shower was a good size we found the sink was over sized so you needed to squeeze your way in to get to the shower and toilet the light switch to the b room was in an odd place and couldt find the switch to use the toilet in the night banged my toe once or twice but no harm done
