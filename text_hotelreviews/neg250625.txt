hospitality what a joke the location and rooms maybe ok but i ve never been treated so badly in my life i checked into the belgrave in pimlico on saturday afternoon after paying upfront for my room and as customary swiped my credit card on arrival to cover any additional costs that may be incurred that evening my wife and i went into the west end and unfortunately had our bag containing all of our cash credit and debit cards car keys and mobile phone stolen we were devastated our devastation never ended there in the morning we went down to reception and explained what had happened and asked if the hotel could possibly help us out and charge my credit card which had already been swiped for and refund us in cash in order to give us enough money to make our way home we were informed that this was not possible as anything charged to a room has to be accounted for by the sale of a product i asked if i could then have paid into their bank account and if they could then give me the in cash as i was completely stranded this suggestion was met with a complete and absolute no i asked if there were any staff member including the indifferent receptionist and duty manager who we were trying to explain our predicament to if they would be prepared to help us out they both treated us as though we were tramps walking off the street asking for some change for our next bottle of cider not like paying guests who had just been robbed and still traumatised at no point did any staff member offer any form of sympathy or help but rather treated us with complete disdain and contempt we checked out of this hotel without having breakfast or even a cup of tea as i was not prepared to give these disgusting people another penny of my money i have never been made to feel so cheap or bad in my life the staff and management of this hotel are a disgrace to the hospitality industry
