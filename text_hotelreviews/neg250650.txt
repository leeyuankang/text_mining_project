we had a couple of issues like paying for a king and being assured our room had a king but really having a queen i don t think they have traditional kings and something was lost in translation there the ac isn t very powerful we set it to and it would say it was but there was no way i asked for a fan or something and they told me to try opening the window since it was cool unfortunately the window wouldn t open the biggest issue was that there was a very foul smell in our bathroom the staff was nice i asked for some freshener to spray and they apologized came back from dinner and it was worse asked for a different room and was given a room that was drastically smaller and on the below street level so we opted to stay in our room and deal with it after buying room spray at tesco by the night it was much better but it was unfortunate again staff was lovely and tried to help the room they had just wasn t what we paid for so we opted for some extra room
