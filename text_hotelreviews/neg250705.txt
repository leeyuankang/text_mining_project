we have been charged twice both on the date of our arrival being for nights we paid cash as soon as we arrived to the receptionist by the name of valentina she was seeking directions from her colleague at the time so we assume she was relatively new i can t recall her issuing a receipt for the cash we always pay cash because we have a travel card we were asked to give details of our credit card as well our credit card has been debited with the australian equivalent of as well any assistance to recover this over payment immediately would be greatly appreciated
