housekeeping could have been better bed mattress was well used and uncomfortable and should have been replaced there is little variety and little choice for breakfast although it is possible to order full english breakfast for an additional four pounds we had expected that they remembered our room number after five mornings but it was obviously too much to ask we had expected to get more value for money we paid after all pounds per night
