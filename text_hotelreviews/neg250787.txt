although we got an upgrade from a standard to an exectuive room the room itself was rather small bathroom surprisingly spacious there is a minibar installed in the wardrobe that makes it impossibe to hang any clothes although there were like hanger we stayed on the first floor facing belgrave road the road is quite busy and opening the window is not really an option the building structure seems to be a weak spot overall we heard all sorts of noise from other guests common problem in the uk but not very enjoyable when we went for breakfast at the room was full and we had to sit upstairs next to the reception more convenient than the very busy room downstairs but with guests checking out close by and its a rather long way to the buffet we left a bag in the bathroom when we left and phoned the hotel two hours later the room had not been cleaned at that point and we were supposed to be called back after the item was retrieved but nothing happened when we got back to the hotel the reception staff was not aware of our problem at least they joined the houskeeping in searching the rubbish for our bag that was eventually found there not the perfect way of handling it in sum the hotel is quite ok but it is not a hidden treasure
