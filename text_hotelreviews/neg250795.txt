this is the second time we booked at the hotel last year we had a very good experience with our accommodation and we decided to book the same hotel for this year trip it was a huge disappointment for us the elevator was out of order for all the days that we were there the towels were dirty the cups for the coffee they were dirty too and i also asked for clean ones the toilet wasn t flush and they send someone from the staff to fix it as soon as we arrived one night around midnight there was a false alarm in the hotel and we had to run out of the hotel with our pajamas while we were sleeping last but not least the day we left we asked the hotel to book a taxi for us we told them we need a taxi that accept visas since we run out of cash they called a taxi and the taxi didn t accept visas when we told to the taxi driver can you please take as to an atm he denied and he said he don t have time to look for an atm so he stop the car while he was driving and he asked my husband to go out and go find an atm before he take us to the bus stop where the bus was waiting for us to take us to the airport my husband went out of the car he found an atm he had money and we paid him in order to take us to our destination when we arrived he didn t even give us a hand with the luggages and he charged us pounds instead of pounds that we paid last year and of what we used to paid almost everyday during our stay there the hotel was very irresponsible with this and made us feel very uncomfortable and almost miss the bus to airport due to the fact that they didn t care about our request i am very disappointed and i don t know if i will be able to consider visiting the hotel again
