we received a very good deal on this room right at for the night for that money it s worth stars however i m well aware the room typically goes for much more i wouldn t pay the typical going rate for a night s stay several reasons the pillows are awful flat and rather hard with only one per person we both woke with stiff necks we did try to obtain a couple of extra but there were none to be found the rooms could also do with better sound proofing aside from the unlucky draw of being placed by the lift we awoke multiple times owing to music and other noises coming through the walls
