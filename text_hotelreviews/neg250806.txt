the manager on duty was not very friendly we were first given a super small dark room down a narrow stair facing a backyard corner obviously one of their few standard rooms compared to the other rooms these do not match the standard i also chose this hotel because of the nespresso machine they have in the rooms surprise because the standard rooms don t have them after some discussion the manager offered us an upgrade to a bigger room with more light and a nespresso machine in it but this was at an additional cost and not complimentary another negative point the air condition in the room worked very poorly and we found out that it can apparently be manually overrun by the reception i froze the whole first night and had to ask for an additional blanket for the second night too late as i woke up with a cold the next morning
