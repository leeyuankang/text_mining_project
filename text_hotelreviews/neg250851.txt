the only disappointment was that breakfast being an open time most guests had chosen to eat in the second hour so there was a queue when we arrived just after had to wait almost minutes to be seated and then rushed along as the staff wanted to be cleared up by continental breakfast was great tho plenty of choice very fresh and great value for money probably the reason why so many guests were taking their time
