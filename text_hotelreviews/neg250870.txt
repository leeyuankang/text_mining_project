i was not impressed with breakfast on the second day we had continental breakfast included in the price and whilst on the first day there were no issues on the second day i was very disappointed we came down at and we had to wait minutes for a table which would have been ok if that was the only issue we were told by the staff that breakfast had been on since and it was pretty much our fault that we had come at the busiest time nothing was mentioned to us at check in that breakfast would be busy at certain times also forgive me for not wanting to get up at when i was on a long weekend city break after we were seated we then had to wait a further minutes for plates as the kitchen ran out causing a mass scramble between everyone when they did re appear and subsequently quickly vanish meaning other people had to wait even longer for plates while we had our breakfast there were no mugs available meaning we were not able to have a hot drink with our breakfast i would probably look at having breakfast elsewhere or set your alarm
