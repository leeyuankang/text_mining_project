not a complaint but an observation no grab handles and shower tray gets quite slippy in use i did slip but did not fall if not possible to fit grab handle would suggest anti slip stickers for shower tray both would be best my wife used the shower once but was afraid to use it more the transparent stickers are available to purchase on line and are easy to use and if correctly fixed can hardly be seen sooner or later i think an older person may fall
