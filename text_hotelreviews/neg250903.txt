small bathroom i realise the price reflected compact rooms but you couldn t even wash your face in the sink properly the small sink and the shelf above it meant you couldn t get your head over the sink properly also the only plug socket in the room was nowhere near the mirror not useful when drying your hair these are small but important points could be rectified i would otherwise have rated the hotel as excellent
