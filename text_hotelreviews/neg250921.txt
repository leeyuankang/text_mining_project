i had asked for a quiet room when booking but on arrival was given a room that turned out to be extremely noisy and i didnt get any sleep in the end i complained to the night receptionist at and they moved me to another room which was larger and quieter the initial room was much smaller and only had a double bed in it even though it was an executive room whereas the one we moved to have a superking size bed and also was an executive room this room had been empty all along why had we not been put into this room in the first place we were also not given any refund or discount although i did ask for one payment was up front so i couldnt withhold any but they said if i booked again they would then give me a discount
