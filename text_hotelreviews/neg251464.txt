when we arrived the first room we were given was so dirty we had to ask to be moved there was broken glass all over the chair spilled wine just lying on the desk and mould and hair all over the shower after investigating the hotel agreed the room had not been sufficiently cleaned if at all so we were moved to another room this room was acceptably cleaner but still shabby and a bit off putting speaking of the shower it went between hot and cold every few seconds which is a surprisingly tortuous experience the bed was tiny the smallest double bed i ve ever slept in my feet were off the edge of the bed and we both felt like we could fall out at any time when we spoke to the staff about these things they were very nice and helpful but slow to deal with the issues most likely due to a busy manager behind the scenes we had to go for a wander near the hotel for an hour before they agreed to move our room we were on holiday and essentially just lost a good hour or two of exploring london we re fairly easy going with hotels as we don t spend much time in them but when you can t even get a decent sleep and shower it s a very bad state of affairs especially when you consider this is supposed to be a four star hotel at per night the photos of the rooms really flatter to deceive they re nowhere near as nice when you arrive this does happen fairly often with hotel rooms as the photographers are so good at getting great shots however in this case you ll be left more disappointed with the reality than usual this hotel will likely continue to do good business due to it s close proximity to euston but it really needs an overhaul i d suggest looking at other similarly priced safer options such as premier inn
