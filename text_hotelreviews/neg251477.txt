the grout tiling on the bathroom floor needs to be redone it looks like someone tried to take up the tile to repair a leak beneath the shower but then did not neatly clean up the grout and it ended up on the tiles there needs to be a soap dish in the shower as there is nowhere to put anything more outlets near the bed would be useful for charging phones and other items
