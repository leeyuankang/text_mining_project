room service i e bed making bathroom cleaning was not finished until late afternoon which was unfortunate as i had returned to the hotel hoping for an afternoon nap before going out again in the evening i have used booking com previously so booked again through you in rather a hurry and had obviously agreed a price i would never have accepted had i double checked i have found the wesley to be good value for money whenever i ve stayed before but certainly not this time if we stay overnight again in london i shall try a different booking service and also other hotels
