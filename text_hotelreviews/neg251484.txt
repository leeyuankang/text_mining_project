it s not a didn t like more a note i recommend the wesley highly but it s a little bland this is reliable comfortable air conditioned hotel it has all the professional amenities light friendly elevators wi fi what it lacks in unique personality and luxury it makes up for in confident friendliness it s not the ritz or the dorchester and it s very nice for that
