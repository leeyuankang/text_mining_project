we paid pounds for one night at the wesley an absolute rip off definately not the bed wasn t bad and the bathroom ok however the dust on the door hinges within the bathroom wasn t a good look the carpet was an absolute disgrace it was beige and was very badly stained also extremely badly fitted kept our shoes on at all times because of this i would never stay there again or recommend to anyone i know things are expensive in london but i wouldn t stay there again if it was free it depressed me over our trip we stayed at five other hotels through booking com all as expected no complaints at all only the wesley was rated wrong the facilities for a comference or the like might be ok but we were on holiday so not required all we wanted was a nice clean room
