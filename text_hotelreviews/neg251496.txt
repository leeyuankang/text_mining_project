the room i stayed in must of been the worst of the worst the room was filthy huge yellow stain on the carpet muck on the bathroom doors hairs in the sink toilet bin was not emptied from the last person i had a single bed which had no sheets on it and a single size duvet with a double duvet cover which was all bunched up at the bottom of the bed when i got in the plugs were in odd places in the room no plugs in the bathroom and the furniture didn t fit together e g desk chair didn t fit into desk therefore stuck out in the middle of a small room my room also had a power supply board in the ceiling which had a cage type cover over it which illuminated a green light all night would not stay here again only good thing was the location but there are plenty of better hotels around
