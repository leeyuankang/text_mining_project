asked if we could check in earlier on booking requirements but instructions were not read room wasn t ready when we needed to get changed for a business meeting asked if we could use a spare room to get changed we were told only superior rooms were available which we were not allowed to use we were then told we could get changed in a conference room which had see through windows and no mirrors to then be told we were not allowed in the conference room after all and had to move to the bathroom which had no electricity facilities and poor lighting very unorganised as a whole the staff could of easily let us use a superior room or our original room despite it not being ready we only needed the room for a total of minutes to enable us to get changed the conference room was a complete disaster of an idea considering the lack of privacy extremely disappointing service when needing to be at a business lunch at wembley stadium
