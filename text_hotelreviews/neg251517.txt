i arrived fairly late so after unpacking and settling into my room i got into bed only to find i had a wet bed i stripped the bed to find a stain and large wet patch on the mattress to be fair to the hotel they changed my room within minutes also if you pay for breakfast in advance you get a voucher to hand in to the restaurant staff i had one for a full english but be warned handing in your voucher is not a prompt for the chef to start cooking no waiting staff told me about breakfast protocol and so i sat unattended for mins thinking my breakfast was being cooked when it wasn t only after i queried the cooking of my breakfast was i told i had to actually order it from the breakfast menu finally and a bit more minor when you leave the lift by reception on the floors above ground level there is no signage to tell you the room numbering sequence and which direction to head for i raised these issues with the hotel reception on checking out and they were very apologetic particularly about the wet bed they said they would email me to offer some kind of remedy hopefully i will hear something soon
