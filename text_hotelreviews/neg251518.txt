bar and restaurant didn t allow use of the gourmet society card unless booked hours in advance although the app does not state as a condition we had lunch but went elsewhere for dinner as a result would think monday night would be a good time to get more diners who will buy more drinks the room had outdated information in the booklet explaining the hotel amenities check out time was wrong as it stated during the week when it is actually luckily we didn t take breakfast or we would likely have been still eating and we checked online when we woke up at we also didn t appreciate the maid knocking on our door minutes before check out or minutes before if you read the information in the room to remind us to check out whilst ignoring the do not disturb sign fair enough to give us a knock when it got to check out time left a bit of a sour taste of our last impression of the hotel the blurb in the hotel intro also seemed completely at odds to what the hotel seems all about not sure where the ethics come in in all i don t feel it was star but happy with the price we paid for what we received
