having a room with no natural light was not great at all there were windows but they were boarded up on the outside and did not allow any light in so it was impossible to know whether it was midnight or nine o clock in the morning very unhappy with that did not like the bed the mattress was far too soft and the duvet did not quite cover the mattress let alone two people underneath it the toilet creaked quite dramatically when you sat on it i thought it was going to crack or come off the wall at one stage not terribly impressed either by the receptionist who checked us in who was putting on her lipstick as she was talking to us to top it all this cost and breakfast was not included needless to say we will not be going back
