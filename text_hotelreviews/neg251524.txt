breakfast felt pretty haphazard the waitress didn t seem interested and the layout of the buffet left something to be desired breakfast was below average and wouldn t recommended the meal plates were too large for toast so ended up having two massive plates coffee was by a machine but had to ask staff about this for it just wasn t worth it would avoid this and find another place nearby to get breakfast was initially given an internal room which was very claustrophobic and had to ask for a different room
