ok so the website said this was marked down from or similar to if i was charged i would have been furious the main lights in the room and bathroom didn t turn on so i just had lamps this made the bathroom quite dangerous to be honest the room was dusty and i mean no ones dusted for days dusty not just a bit had settled in a day i m not being a snob i d call this dirty the mirror on the desk had what looked like part of a sneeze on it the bottle of water on the desk had bits floating around in it the air con is centrally controlled so even though i was boiling already the heat kicked on at about and stayed on until sometime in the night i opened the window but then had to deal with noise i should have been able to turn off the heat surely i reckon the booking com site give false initial prices because this was no room i would pay hostel prices at best maybe up to but will never go here again keep searching there are better hotels nearby
