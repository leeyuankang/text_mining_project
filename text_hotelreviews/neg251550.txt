the room we were given had no natural light at all it felt like we were staying in a dungeon breakfast was very overpriced there was little choice for people having to avoid gluten in their diet the hotel is poor compared to what it was like just a couple of years ago having stayed at the wesley a number of times in the past when it was a much better offer we ve decided to stay elsewhere on our visits to london from now on
