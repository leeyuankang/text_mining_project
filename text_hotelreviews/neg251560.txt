we were both disappointed by the breakfasts when a hotel says breakfast included i expect a cooked breakfast option i certainly don t expect to have to pay extra for one the continental breakfast was marred by the penny pinching butter portions i wonder how much return business you lose to save pennies the organisation was also poor e g you ran out of eggs which i reported but there were still no eggs later we last visited the wesley some years ago when the shower leaked badly which we reported exactly the same happened this time i noted that the bottom of the door frame had rotted because of the on going problem the staff kindly organised an alternative room we won t be returning to the wesley i m sorry to say
