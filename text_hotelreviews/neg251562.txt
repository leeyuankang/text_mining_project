i thought i had paid for breakfast when booking but not clear as it was only continental which admittedly was a nice spread but i have to pay and extra for cooked breakfast as it described it as buffet and last time i visited the cooked was a buffet so misleading when i ordered the breakfast it was very nice farm quality produce and better than he old buffet selection
