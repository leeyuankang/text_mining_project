hotel is cold and humid both in the room and in the restaurant every night i had to ask them to start the air warming which is centrally controlled and could not be activated from my room on my own my window had only heavy plastic curtains i had a vintage bed with vintage springs under the mattress room floors have very narrow corridors the restaurant is too highly priced for the level of kitchen they have and for the little portion you get in your dish positive note food is fresh and this is the most important thing
