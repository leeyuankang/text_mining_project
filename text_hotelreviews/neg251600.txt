between and i rang the restaurant six times attempting to order some room service food the phone was not answered once i therefore had to order a takeaway and i would have much preferred the room service this has happened at least three times during my last four visits so i m assuming the restaurant is short staffed and they were prioritising the actual customers in the restaurant it s a shame as the restaurant lost of business and the waiter lost a tip
