the bathroom was made for a thin short person i am normal build so got in and out again hence i am able to write about this but i am not short and the toilet was so close to the wall that anyone above average height would scrape their knees on it the boiler broke while i was there and so there was no hot water for a morning shower initially i was a bit miffed about this but the staff were so lovely i couldn t stay cross for long and they did their best to keep everyone happy and clean by offering alternative rooms as the water came back on the breakfast was not good however very uninspiring and the staff in the bar weren t anywhere near as friendly as those on reception
