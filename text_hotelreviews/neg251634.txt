we have chosen thewesley because of its good position to reach harry potter studios but we won t suggest this place we booked in advance but when we arrived at night the staff couldn t find our reservation and the hotel was fully booked not really a good experience then the staff gave us the last room left that was for disabled without any information and we had some difficulties in using a bathroom without a proper shower even if the staff apologized for the inconvenience the manager was very rude
