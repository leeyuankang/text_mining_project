i didn t like the fact that i got robbed while we were waiting for our taxi back to the airport right outside the hotel entrance by guys on a motorbike who drove into me before stealing my phone that spoiled what was an otherwise really nice experience with the hotel local police told me that this is a common thing in this area so it would have been nice if the police warned hotels tourists about this so the hotels can better protect their guests
