room freezing as window was wide open when i arrived tried to warm the room as per instructions only to be told hours later when room was still freezing that staff were centrally controlling the room temperature which seemed strange heard another guest also complaining his room was cold noise and vibration from underground trains was very noticeable so moved rooms from ground floor to floor much quieter
