second day the water they provided had soap in so after taking a glass i could of drank bleach for all i know bathroom was covered in water marks the hangers were layed out the wrong way making it hard to hang clothes and take them back again no where to store shoes other than a small gap between the safe and wall the hot breakfast was a disappointment as they are kept in heating dishes with lids so all the food is soggy and overcooked not a chance you will get a runny yoke or a crispy piece of bacon or hash brown
