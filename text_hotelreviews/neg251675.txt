i had booked a single twin room which was extremely tiny it looked fine at first but i wasn t impressed by the cleanliness of the carpet or the bathrooms also the sink was tiny i think i got the smallest version of a single room not like the ones in the pictures then the heating didn t work and i spent the night freezing i had to call them to check it out at am but they couldn t resolve it i had to ask for extra blankets that were not available in the room the bed had no headboard and the window was just above it where i kept brushing my head with the curtain it was too late at night to ask for a room change but i did next morning and the front office gladly gave me an upgrade to a double room and a free breakfast her name was fatima she was very nice and took a decision right away the double room i got had a double bed the room was small for a double room but compared to the single it is heaven so price wise i think it is a bit overpriced for the quality of the facilities
