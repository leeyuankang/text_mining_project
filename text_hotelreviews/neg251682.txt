very overpriced paid for an upgraded room which was still small and i cannot actually see what the upgrade was supposed to be upon arrival the girl on reception never smiled once carpets were stained throughout the tv was round a corner out of view from the bed so you had to sit on a chair in front of the tv in order to see it which was very uncomfortable when we had had a long jpurney and just wanted to chill in bed watching tv this was not at all possible given the room layout the double bed was singles pushed together so highly uncomfortable especially in the middle near where the beds were joined very noisy all night due to trains and tubes going past all night had very broken sleep so was subsequently tired the next day which was a big deal given that i had an exam in london paid for breakfast very little choice when i asked for porridge i was informed there would be an additional charge which i found ridiculous given that i had paid this would have been a very expensive bowl of porridge had i have paid the room was cold with no option of self controlling the room temperature and no radiator in the room overall i paid over for a hotel which was no better than a star very disappointed
