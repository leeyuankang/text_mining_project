generally it was a good experience just one little thing i would like to mention that i did make a connection with the wesley about exchanging double bed room to a twin bed room and i received their reply said it was okay if i accepted to pay extra pounds then i did reply as i accepted to pay extra pounds for exchanging to a twin bed room however my reservation did not be changed i still was serviced with a big double bed room actually i am not sure if i was required for the extra pounds maybe my requirement was not sent to the wesley precisely
