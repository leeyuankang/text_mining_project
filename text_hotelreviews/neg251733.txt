the hotel should do something with the photos of the rooms and their description now this information is very misguiding standard twin bedroom is very small and cannot offer minimum comfort for two persons stars hotel without mini bar even if it is not needed is very odd but there is not even a small fridge there was a strong noise through the whole night made by the outside air conditioner or ventilator i do not know if it belongs to the hotel or other facility nearby booking com should seriously look into reasons of placing this hotel under stars category it is certainly not at least in comparison with standard stars hotels in europe
