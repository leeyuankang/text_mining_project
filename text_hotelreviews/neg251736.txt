we arrived late and weary after a concert and discovered the aircon didn t work and the room was a cosy all night but wait you can open a window right wrong t behind the glass were boards or bricks so no window to open and like being in a sauna not a very enjoyable stay as it was when we arrived back certainly didn t have the inclination or time to be faffing about trying to get it repaired was a little disappointed to say the least
