this hotel compares itself with some of the more premium hotels locally and comes up wanting the experience when you arrive is some sort of twenties meets seventies car rental showroom think black and white sparkly marble there s a reason no pictures are on their website this would be forgiven if the staff were nice but i was greeted by a young lady devoid of any personality warmth or sense of humour she was professional and efficient but was only interested in taking my money i am a very seasoned traveler and this was the first time i have been actually charged for my stay up front card details are of course taken for security but the money was hastily removed from my account before i was pointed to my room with no mention of where i should go for breakfast so i made my way to my room in a very dubious lift with no offer of assistance with my bags not that i needed it but to be offered is something that most staff are encouraged to offer especially in a higher end hotel the conversion of the building itself is terrible they have divided this likely listed building up into tiny rooms then they have proceeded to clad the walls with cheap wood likely to cover up the still evident terrible painting and decorating work the mattress on the bed was by far the worst i have slept on in years it provides no support and springs were evident throughout at this point i was feeling very disappointed but i thought i ll turn to the minibar and the television for solace i searched only to find no minibar so poured myself a glass of complimentary tap water dressed up in wesley bottles to look like mineral water and sat down to put a movie on the disappointment continued the television was no more than inches that might be generous and the menus were in a foreign language i do realise a previous guest could have altered this and there was no premium content on offer at all
