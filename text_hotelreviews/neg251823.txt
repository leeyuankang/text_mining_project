the hotel is undergoing extensive renovations so there are many areas of the hotel such as the dinning room that are being housed in temporary locations the dining room felt like a student caf it had no atmosphere was dirty and unorganised the walls also seem very thin we could clearly hear the conversation of our neighbours in the first room they put us in i complained about the room itself bed too small and interior was dingy as well as the noise so we were upgraded to a superior room from a deluxe that was much better we could however still hear our neighbour we will give the hotel another chance once the works are complete
