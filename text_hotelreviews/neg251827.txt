for a hotel described as luxurious i would describe it as basic at best small cramped poorly laid out rooms and the double bed was two single beds pushed together that weren t even the same height needed a mind the gap sign in the middle to avoid the sudden drop between us the staff were not friendly or helpful at all we were not greeted or asked how our stay was it was awful barely any sleep as someone decided to have a disco in the building next door which combined with the constantly dripping plumbing made the night very long and uncomfortable when i contacted reception to see if a quieter room or some earplugs were available i was told it was too late to sort anything and that the staff couldn t hear the noise from reception lucky them being on the other side of the building after a terrible night being woken by the building work at on a sunday the shower then leaked all over the bathroom floor and into the bedroom turning our room into some kind of lagoon four stars i think not
