my single room was tiny yet only slightly cheaper than a roomier double room the dining breakfast room and bar was cold windowless lacked comfortable sitting possibilities and tablecloths and was in all the total opposite of cosy and comfortable i wouldn t dine or go for an evening drink there for the love of god
