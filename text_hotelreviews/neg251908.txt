very expensive oh my god the bed perhaps it s just personal preference but i actually only managed about two hours sleep i like a bit of firmness there was none whatsoever far too soft the pillow too after three minutes my head had sank so low it felt like only the pillow case was left for support really uncomfortable and restless night
