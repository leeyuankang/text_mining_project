both staff on that day of sept were so miserable no manners what so ever and the cleaner plugged her hoover lead in behind me and the took it down the stairs one of the guests saw this and told her to unplug it immediately as i was walking with aids and if i had turned around i would have fell and hurt myself the staff didn t even apologise i will never stay here again and i stay a lot in euston i would it recommend it either the standard double room was lacking in specs one side pushed against a wall do you had to climb into the other side which is impossible if you are elderly or disabled my mother and i were quite disgusted overall especially with the staff
