firstly i was put in a superior deluxe room on the ground floor and i could feel the vibrations of the tube underneath so was moved to floor disabled room which ok but equipped for a person in a wheelchair the carpets and skirting boards were stained and dirty the towel rail fell off and then the inside of the wardrobe collapsed the hotel is shabby and cheap and no way near worthy of a star
