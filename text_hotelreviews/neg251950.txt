the receptionists were not as helpful as i would have expected at a hotel of this kind as i stood at the desk the female receptionist asked the male receptionist whose passport this was pointing next the the computer the male receptionist just laughed and said oh it was a ladies i keep forgetting to give them back and they don t ask so i found this manner and uncaring attitude worrying i think that customer service definitely needs addressing the taxi service used by the hotel definitely over charges a journey to the mall cost me to get there but return after midnight only cost information about late checkout was not noted on my reservation and in the space of the that i spent at the hotel i had to correct the receptionist times that i would be checking out at rather than it was not recorded on my reservation that i had paid upon arrival and as i was leaving i was asked for the receipt for my payment which luckily i had kept but was at the bottom of my suitcase this wasted time which i didn t have to waste and i find quite unorganized and incompetent when i returned home i had been charged twice for the room despite only giving my card to the receptionist once at the time of check in it did however state that it had been re credited to me but it was still charged twice
