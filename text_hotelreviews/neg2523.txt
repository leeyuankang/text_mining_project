i booked a deluxe twin room as per the photos it looked good enough when we got into the room which was hardly x i thought i made a mistake because it had a king size bed with two single mattresses on it with cm gap between them instead of two single beds we went to the reception to check they said this is the only available room and we can t give you your money back the room was so tiny we hardly had any space for our baggage staff all look unhappy the breakfast experience is even worse good staff but greedy greedy management and owners really bad experience
