they must have had experience with folk not paying due to the way they went on about payment by card being automatically taken for one night indeed payment seemed to be the focus and take priority when checking in not a real negative but after a hard day working in london after a long commute and turning up for a really nice relaxing experience left one feeling a little oh ok that s how it is then room was small and in the basement and you could see people walking right by on the pavement above while standing by the window when talking on the phone which i had to do since the signal was poor however it could make for an amusing gentleman s past time for someone else of course when the summer really kicks in and skirts get shorter they seem to pack rooms into that building and neighbours are easily overheard room was rather soulless and didn t have any character or charm at all there was a small long thin vase with real carnations in which was a nice touch but it fell over and spilt the water on the floor due to the naff round metal glass table it was on being very un level as soon as i tried to move it out of the way of the pop out desk i mopped the water with a towel btw the air con was making a racket so i turned it off but a fan was still whirring and randomly screaming all night regardless despite consuming several pints at the mitre down the road in a solely medicinal attempt at ensuring slumber of any reasonable length i only got sleep but i don t sleep very well in hotels anyway and use earplugs i was alone but the wife snores at home so is a habit so wasn t sure if the fan thing was enough of an issue to try and switch rooms during checkout i wasn t asked about my stay so didn t bother to mention it room guys beware
