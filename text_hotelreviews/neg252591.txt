the air condition was not working they changed my work but it was not working at that room as well they brought a heater but the heater also didnt work after minutes the room was cold and then i found out that even the window had hole near its holder it is not at all a good hotel especially for that high price that they charge they charge almost euro per night but their services compared to other hotels only worth euro per night it is even not a real star hotel let alone star
