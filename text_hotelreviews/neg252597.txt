the reception desk was not very communicative the lights in the room turned on only by putting the room key card in a slot by the door it is such an unusual way to turn on the lights in a room that one would think that the the desk clerk would tell you we also shut the door with the key cards in the room we went to the reception desk and they issued us another card without telling us that the original key cards were invalid and last but not least we were charged euros for drinks at the bar we expected higher charges but not enormous charges we paid euros for the same drinks at a cafe down the street we really left with sadness about our experience the last time we were there they were much more efficient seems like the arrogance of the french towards tourists is coming back too bad the city was basically empty of tourists no waiting for popular sites
