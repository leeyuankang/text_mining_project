the hotel restaurant staff were very poor and unattentive i waited over minutes to be acknowledged i had to ask for my drinks after my meal had been served the wrong drinks were brought out without even an apology they did not once check back on me throughout the meal and i than had to ask for my bill and than waited another minutes to receive it very average service which is chalk and cheese to the service i received at the hoxton in amsterdam
