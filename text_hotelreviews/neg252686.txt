misleading room description led me to think it was a better bigger room terminology on booking doesn t match the hoxton website booking said it was a discounted deal but was actually more than on the hotels own website early check in wasn t possible but only found out on arrival asked for a room on a higher floor but when we got back at we were given a floor room asked if the restaurant was still open and excited it was dropped bags off came down only to be told it was closed told no room service asked how we could get food only to be given a dominoes menu mattress on the bed was soft thin the bed squeaked with every turn in the night really was a stay of style over substance wouldn t stay in a cosy double again
