staff were rude and came up to us to say that we needed to leave it turned out that one disgruntled person didn t like how we were queueing at the bar once we told them we were paying guests at the hotel and also explained that we d been ideal guests they were apologetic of course but it took the shine off a good evening and i don t recommend others go there if they are from ethnic minorities
