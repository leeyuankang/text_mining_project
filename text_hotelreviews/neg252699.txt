when we booked we selected to have a quiet room however our room was on the first floor facing the busy road outside which made it rather noisy with the windows open the room was also above the foyer area where there is a restaurant and bar which had a dj playing and therefore revellers outside the hotel smoking and socialising until quite late we ate lunch at the hoxton grill downstairs however the chicken breast was rather gristly with several pieces of bone this was brought to the attention of the waitress but no action was taken or apology made
