i would ve given a higher rating but the staff and customer service leaves a lot to be desired with exceptions who were responsive helpful i rarely put in requests when i travel but it so happened that i needed to carry a number of bulky items so i requested for a paper bag to hold them the staff completely forgot my request and had to follow up times in a span of hour to check on the status only to be told they didn t have it in the end during another instance i requested to borrow a pair of scissors and they forgot my request fed up after minutes i had to go down the front desk to get it myself only to be told they were too busy to bring it to my room
