this place needs to decide if it s more important to run this place as a hotel catering for the guests or as a nightclub the guests are totally ignored when it comes to being able to have a quiet drink at the bar with friends or colleagues later in the week for example the lounge is totally taken over on thursday friday and saturday night by nightclubbers the place also has a very loud disco jammed packed with party goers it s totally impossible to even get to the bar have a seat or be able to talk to your friends in fact even trying to get into your hotel on a saturday night is a mission having to queue at the door be scrutinised by burly security personnel only to find once inside that you have to push your way through the crowds of people to get to the lift even then in your room you can hear the loud music their breakfast is a strange system they have nice pastries on display but you can t help yourself why not have a buffet instead of having to wait a long time for the waitress to arrive then a longer time for the food then they want you to pay a service charge
