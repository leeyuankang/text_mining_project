the reception wouldn t check in my partner and give him key to the room beacuse the reservation was in my name he had e mail with the reservation but was told they need e mail from me we have never come across such a requirement despite beeing frequent travels neither has this been specified at the time of booking in result he had to wait in the lobby until i arrived while we both appreciate extra security the person at the desk dealing with us couldn t sound less helpful
