the rooms are very small the bed is only a double and there is nowhere to place your luggage it would suit a single person but not a couple the cleaning staff also knocked on our door several times during our stay sometimes as early as despite us having placed the do not disturb sign on the door we arrived late one evening from a few drinks and found that our access cards wouldn t work the lady at reception was needlessly rude overall while the hotel amenities are very cool the rooms themselves are lacking i did not feel that the hotel was worth the price paid
