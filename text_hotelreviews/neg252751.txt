having house services knocking on the door at when it was a check out asking if they could do the room yet don t really see the point of a check out time if you get interrupted earlier anyway we told reception who said we should have put a do not disturb sign up i don t think that on the morning you are due to leave you should have to put a do not disturb sign up i think they should just communicate with house services when guests have checked out so the room can be cleaned then it is quite an expensive hotel so i thought they could have considered this
