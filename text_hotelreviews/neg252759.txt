our room had a distinct mildew odor after one shower i discovered why the beautiful shower door had a design defect water drips between the door and wall gap runs under the bedroom floor boards i asked twice to speak with a manager via email or in person this never happened the desk staff suggested a room move but other rooms had the same issue final immediate solution more bath mats it was too noisy to open the windows for ventilation the lobby club crowd and door bouncers can be a bit much in the evening for hotel guests
