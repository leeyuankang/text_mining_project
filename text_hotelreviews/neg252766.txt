this hotel is a cool hipster place smack bang in the middle of trendy hoxton shoreditch it is noisy in the extreme friday saturday the reception bar areas were more of a nightclub with a dj playing from early on make sure your room is high up or away from the reception areas at all costs otherwise like me you will be requesting a room move at at night which they did accommodate because of the noise
