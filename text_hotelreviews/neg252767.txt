stayed on a saturday and sunday night for a course i was taking in london my girlfriend came with me to make a weekend away of it room on first floor loud thumping music comes right through the hotel from the bar in the lobby from about i cannot understand how anyone could ever have stayed in those rooms unless perhaps they went out early and did not return until the hotel bar had closed so we complained and were immediately moved to the top floor no quibble i cannot complain about the staff during this interaction here the problem though is that even from the top floor it s not a huge amount better to be honest the place seems to have pretty poor sound proofing ran into several couples in the lifts and on corridors who seemed to be experiencing the same incredulity at the volume level that was our first night on the second night we went to a friend s house for dinner and when we came back we found a note under our door telling us that they had tried to phone me but could no get through to let me know that refurbishment works would start at on our floor now the floor and if we would like to change rooms again to just ask at the reception while the staff were nice when i asked to move the first time you couldn t really consider it a great service to be promptly moved out of a room that no one should have been put in to begin with and then to be asked if i would like to move out of the second room as well there was no voicemail or missed call on my phone so i don t know how seriously someone tried to call me not that this would have ameliorated my disappointment with the whole experience though if i am being honest also because the ground floor and lobby essentially function as a night club when you return in the evenings you will be subject to the usual scrutiny and menace from the now ubiquitous enormous thug bouncers that you find around london everywhere
