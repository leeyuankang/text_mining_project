expected more as the pictures and description sold it as unique and luxurious room was small with a small double bed and furniture and floor was worn and tired very expensive as it was not luxurious the hotel and bar restaurant was very nice but we were only using the room and we could have stayed somewhere equally was nice for half the price gutted i spent so much for something that wasn t unique or luxurious
