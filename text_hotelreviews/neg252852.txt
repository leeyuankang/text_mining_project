not being able to book a table in the restaurant despite paying a lot of money to stay there the restaurant and bar were packed throughout our stay which made for a bit of a frustrating situation room service was also really slow during busy times gives you the impression they aren t really set up for that extent of service which is a shame as you re paying a lot to stay there
