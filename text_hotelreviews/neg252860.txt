the head door man kevin i believe his name is is very rude i dont think he understands the etiquette of the place based on the amount of times i ve been there he doesn t know how to speak to people my friends were kicked out of the hotel on sunday based on the altercation that happened friday when he insisted i leave the premises rudely without finishing my drink and we both had words we were sat in the hotel peacefully on sunday and he wasn t even on shift that day he came over insisted we leave the building as i was banned i didn t get how the bar manager thought it was okay to include or get him involved in the discussion bearing in my mind he wasn t even wearing his security badge the bouncer on that night was actually polite none the less we agreed to leave without an altercation and got a refund for my room not the great of experiences like i said i stay there all the time this guy is on a power trip
