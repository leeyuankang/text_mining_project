upon arriving there was no hot or cold water in the entire hotel this issue was fixed at around next morning as a temporary solutions we were given bottles of water to make some tea but we had to ask for them nobody bothered to offer in advance on top of that instead of paying for the night my card was charged for after phone calls and live chats at the reception in the end i ve got refunded but only later got a free breakfast as an apology for not having water at all the entire night and for taking extra money from my account i don t know how to thank them for the generosity
