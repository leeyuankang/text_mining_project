hotel bar and restaurant are very very busy with groups from outside of the hotel to be fair we went in mid december so first night friday looked like a massive xmas party but the second was more groups and birthdays etc and perhaps more like the norm this caused us no issues for the room we couldn t hear the busy bar and music below but meant if you just wanted to have a drink before you headed out it was very busy and took ages to get a drink and the only places left to sit were reserved for external groups being a hotel this isn t a brilliant experience when your hotel guests end up playing second fiddle to people on a night out pillows on the beds were rubbish so sleep wasn t the best and a bit disappointing to be honest
