i might have missed it but as a vegan i d like the option of featherless duvets and pillows i didn t like the fact that the hotel stay was completely non refundable i can t imagine that they struggle to fill the rooms so a cancellation option would be nice the staff in the bar restaurant had no idea which of their wines were vegan so it meant although only of us was vegan we all went out to drink
