we were made to move hotels because of hot water issues the mattress was yellow with stains if i had noticed this before the morning we certainly would not have stayed in that room i was informed the next day that they had thrown the mattress out it certainly couldn t have been cleaned the headboard was stained the staff were thoroughly unhelpful they couldn t even get me some new batteries for the remote control a second bed had been crowbarred into our room and made it impossible to open the fridge
