i have stayed at the cavendish on jermyn street numerous times before and never had a problem this time the room was filthy when i arrived plus the hotel tried to overcharge me on vacating the room the hotel tried to charge me for breakfast that i did not have and questioned my integrity when i said i had not had breakfast per the time stamped on the breakfast chitty i had actually been at work for an hour in mayfair when the breakfast was being eaten attitude of the hotel stank especially towards a guest who has stayed numerous times before usually in the most expensive penthouse suite having stayed in this hotel for the past years usually in the penthouse suite i will not be returning and therefore they have lost a valuable customer
