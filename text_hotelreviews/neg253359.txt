sadly the maintenance of this hotel seems to be sadly lacking we were put into a room and the air conditioning wasn t working it appeared that the gaul was on the whole floor talking to other people we were moved to another room after complaining there was a fault with the hot water in the hotel tepid shower friday night stone cold saturday morning its bad when you have to boil a kettle to have a wash hot water restored saturday night but off again sunday we had had drinks in the bar on the saturday and they offered us off the bill which barely covered the service charge which we found quite pathetic eventually the whole bar bill was written off but i would have preferred to pay the bill and have had hot water
