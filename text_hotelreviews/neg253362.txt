the room photos on the internet are not representative of what the rooms are like the room photo shows a chair lounge to read in but my room was so small there was no room for a chair i was told they show the higher price rooms on the internet there was no place to plug in a hair dryer anywhere near a mirror service at breakfast was terrible and to rub salt in the wound i was charged a mandatory service fee for a buffet breakfast hotel location is good but there a few casual dining option nearby
