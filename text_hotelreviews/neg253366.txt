everything with the exception of the location this hotel is without a doubt the worst hotel i have stayed in since being a student the rooms are tiny and decorated with lots of poor quality cheap furnishing the staff are good on arrival but the night staff are shocking when we complained about the noise of possibly air conditioning units outside our room the night manager suggested we must be light sleepers avoid and spend your money in one of the many lovely hotels nearby
