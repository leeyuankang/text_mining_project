restaurant was a bit of a let down for lunch bit tired uninspiring menu and staff after first course weren t bothered about us at all chatting amongst themselves we were the only ones there breakfast wasn t the best nasty cheap sugary muesli for instance when for the price per head you expect top notch stuff certainly wouldn t bother again room was really noisy as we were somehow near a bar but quiet by ish so not a huge quibble
