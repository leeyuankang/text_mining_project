it was our engagement weekend i had notified the hotel of this prior to our arrival and i had asked for an upgrade on arrival the receptionist asked were we here for a special occasion but my partner didn t know of my plans so i couldn t say yes wen we got our room it was tiny no upgrade no welcome pack nothing the hotel totally forgot my request i could not complain as my girlfriend would have known something was going on i was so disappointed as i really wanted her first trip to london to be special and finally to top it all as i was paying with my debit card the hotel took an extra to cover any extra spending so they left me short that too and i won t get that back into my account for five working days thanks a lot guys
