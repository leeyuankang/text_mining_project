breakfast was badly organized a lot of items ran out and were not refilled in a long time bread selection was very limited and if bad quality it took forever just to get a cup of tea coffe we waited minutes for our coffee both saturday and sunday absolutely not worth the money there are a lot of nicer breakfast places close by
