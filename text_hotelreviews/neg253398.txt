the room is pretty small in consideration to what you pay for but that is london in general the walls are quite thin so be prepared to hear cleaners and your neighbours the only real complaint that i have is the service at breakfast i stayed for weeks and had breakfast times only and yet every time i was left waiting to be served the staff are polite but grossly inefficient all times i had to fight to make my orders and to be served which is frustrating when all you want in the morning is a hot cup of tea and some warm toasts
