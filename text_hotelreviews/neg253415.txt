the first night we were in a room where the air conditioning was not working and could not be fixed the second night we were moved to another room on the top floor with a great view but the bathroom smelled very strongly of cigarette smoke and there was a room opposite which was constantly being used by cleaning staff so it was quite noisy i think we were just quite unlucky though the housekeeping staff might have noticed the smell in the bathroom
