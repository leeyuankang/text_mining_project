the service at breakfast left a lot to be desired very slow to bting things had to be asked several times understanding of english was not good however one person stood out as bring efficient professional and friendly he dealt with what should have been an omelette very well and gave us a half a bottle of champagne to compensate for it we upgraded our room which had a superb view but was very noisy next to the fire exit
