the staff in charge of luggage and the parking garage on the other hand were polite but very slow to react to my simple requests it took over for them to bring up cars which were physically away from the lobby and they forgot one too so i had to ask again and then the driver had a hard time manoevering my car so as we were late i just had to intervene and get it out myself it was as if he simply didn t understand how to get the car out with the space at his disposal also upon arrival we asked the garage staff to assist us in getting the congestion charge sorted out they simply pointed to a phone number and said to call it this was not expected at all that guests are supposed to take care of such details and it s only when i complained that they were willing to help but at that time it was already too late so i ll have to deal with it online and perhaps incur a surcharge
