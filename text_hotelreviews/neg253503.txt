we had booked the hotel before and paid for stay two days before arriving in london we found a deal on the web site offering the same room rate but with breakfast included breakfast was per person per day over a lot of money for us we asked that our stay could also include breakfast but the hotel didn t allow it i guess that as we had prepaid and they had had our money for we had little to negotiate with other than the hotel s good will our original room was so small we couldn t get to the bed when our suitcases were placed inside there was not enough cupboard space to unpack our cases so we had to upgrade finally as we were being picked up at we asked to keep the room until then the hotel demanded per hour most hotels will allow a late stay unless they are full as it makes no difference to the hotel if the room is not needed until the next day anyway so for us it was another cause for dissatisfaction with the overall hotel s policies
