i would have preferred more details with regards to parking not just discovering on arrival that there was no parking onsite but that we had to pay around to purchase and drive down a particular street to find parking we did not mind doing all this but some forewarning would have saved us the worry when we arrived to find no parking after reading in the handbook that an early breakfast before was sometimes available we booked breakfast only to discover this was not available and the receptionist did not want to refund us despite advising by night before we waited until a new member of staff came on duty and our money was refunded without question our room was lovely but very very tiny as was the shower
