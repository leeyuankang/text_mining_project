it doesn t say on the website that in order to get to your room you have to ring a door bell of an indian restrurant take away that never seems to be open and the door was always locked if you worry about safety and fire risks this is not the place for you you then go through the restaurant past the counter and go up the locked stairs at the back which were very narrow there were security camara s at every narrow corridor at eye level the room wasn t big enough to open my suitcase the shower was so small i had to open the shower doors not to get my hair wet
