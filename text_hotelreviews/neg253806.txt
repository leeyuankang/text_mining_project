this is not a hotel it s a takeaway with rooms above it the clientel were quite intimidating for a solo female returning late at night the stairs are so narrow that i would be concerned how to get out in case of fire the room was tiny and mostly taken up with a double bed the whole place has a slightly strange atmosphere
