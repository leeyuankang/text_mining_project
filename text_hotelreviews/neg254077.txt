with a booking com rating of i thought i was going to be staying in quite a nice little boutique hotel but ended up in a closet i had a room with no natural daylight or fresh air the one window that opened had an internal fire escape next to it so i had to sleep with it closed the air conditioning which didn t work to begin with was noisy the minibar didn t work at all the hairdryer was one of those old hot air boxes with corrugated wide bore tubing the curtain rail was missing a finial maybe the double rooms are better but this little single was way over priced compared to other london hotels breakfast was included but i just wanted to get out into fresh clean air in the mornings so glad i only booked nights
