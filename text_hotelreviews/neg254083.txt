the mattresses were quite soft and uncomfortable and could use an upgrade the decor of the rooms were also quite outdated the hotel didn t provide things found at other hotels of the same category like complimentary water bottles cups in the bathroom etc the air conditioning in the room was not cooling as much as it should have overall we expected more value for the price we paid
