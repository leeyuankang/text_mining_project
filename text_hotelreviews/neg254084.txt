the pictures are probably photoshopped i was disappointed plus arrived after a long day and didn t have hot water went to the reception and she just didn t do anything except making a call this was unacceptable i was provided by a mail to send a complaint great service and we paid over pounds for a night i think i could have gone instead to a decent hostel
