this is a budget hotel first and foremost do not expect any frills for all your money well overpriced for what it is london has a great hotel stock you can find better would be about ok at a night there is no phone in the room so if you want to call reception you have to google the number and call using your own phone that was a first for me the beds really were uncomfy old and soft you could really feel the springs gave me a bad back and neck the two single beds kept parting slightly too the room light switches are not wired correctly into a multiway ring if the switch by the bed is off the switch by the door does not turn the lights on it took us ages to turn the lights on after we entered the room if only there was a phone to call reception i actually walked down to reception to ask how to turn the lights on and was told to put my key card in the wall slot there is no wall slot have the reception staff actually been inside the rooms the shower was warm but not hot however to be fair this was fixed once we reported it of the shower heads only of them worked one of the light fittings was missing a bulb staff half way through a conversation with me just picked up a ringing phone without even saying excuse me breakfast was really not worth the effort of walking all the way to the basement wifi was slow ended up just tethering from my mobile to stay online
