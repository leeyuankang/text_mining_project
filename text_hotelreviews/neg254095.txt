double bed was in fact singles pushed together so not very comfortable shower involved pulling screen out over floor to get in and turn shower on which had a very poor jet of water difficult to get too wet under breakfast finished at we arrived at and there was not enough space for us to sit at a table we waited for a while then the waitress said she d let us know when there was a table ready we eventually returned at still no space so waited until a table was available the staff were ok to serve us but there was not much available to eat by then we didn t bother the next morning
