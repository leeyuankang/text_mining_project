on the other side my room was on the basement so it felt like it hasn t seen some fresh air in a long time it was clean but i got a bit allergic at first later i got used the main problem was the toilet it seemed nice but it was one of the worst toilet seats ever it was broken and although it was clean it had steins on it and seemed terrible
