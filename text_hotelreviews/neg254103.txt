to tell th truth the hotel is not worth living in it kindly speaking my colleagues have arrived on a business trip with the expectations to work in the hotel as the hotel says that wifi works properly but my colleagues had no possibilities to work there as this wi fi was extremely slow in all public areas but this is not the only problem the air conditioning in the room did not work as it shoul and that s why it was extremely cold in the room do you imagine the situation when you arrive exhausted after work and are afraid of catching the cold beacause you can not turn off the air conditioning and then you see that the ventilation aperture was plugged with dust and dirt which is very bad for health and one more problem the window curtains were awfully dirty that s not the condiotions which could be offered by the hotel the rooms we have booked should have been but in fact they were too small and my colleagues didn t even have possibility to place their luggage in addition to all these problems there is no lobby in the hotel and as the consequence no place to work in also there are no sockets to plug in a standard european plug neither there is a plug adopters we could borrow at the reception the hotel in london shouldn t have this kind of problems we highly do not recommend this hotel and looking forward for the refund because the money we have paid do not correspond to the level of the service of the hotel
