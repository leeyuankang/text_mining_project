one night is enough in a windowless room well there were windows but they looked out over a dark stairwell no chair in room no space couldn t do any work in there when i arrived there was no one on reception and anyone could access the property i had to telephone a number for attention it was explained to me that there were cctv cameras but even so at a time of heightened security alerts this did worry me
