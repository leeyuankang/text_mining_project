booked as a deluxe room so paid extra tiny bathroom with fixtures and fittings loose and wobbly taps shower fixings toilet seat impossibly cramped and loose shower was warm at best and a very cheap look shower cubicle too small for anyone over ft tall room itself smallest hotel room i ve ever stayed in room door hits bed as you open it bed itself appeared nice and well presented but soon realise it s two singles pushed together that seperate easily on the polished plastic looking floor no desk or dresser one very small wardrobe the room was in the basement and laid out like an average student bedsit no phone to reception hotel boasts room service which is actually log in to a website and order from a local takeaway thats signed up to the website if they are open a cycle courier delivers i did try thos and it was ok but flatters the hotel breakfast was poor on selection and the dining room was tiny cramped and little effort put into service had to help myself to hotplate buffet style which limited food i think there was staff in the room but there was a constant smell of smokers from the kitchen which seemed to fill the whole basement throughout the stay staff were either smoking in the kitchens not even making eye contact or in the case of the receptionist on arrival just not there had to phone to get checked in reception is not a lot more than a booth in the wall overall i have stayed in hotels around london and can call them hotels with their plus and minus points i have also stayed in hostels around the country this place had the feel of a hostel but just spruced up with modern plush looking decor and furniture i booked and thought i d paid for a smart london hotel for my partner and i to enjoy a west end show we loved the show and our time in the city but sadly the hotel part took away that aspect and i am extremely impressed
