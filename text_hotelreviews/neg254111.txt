booking process once at the hotel was a bit of a shambles room was booked with a business credit card to which they needed a signed authorisation form from the card holder in advance the request for this form was sent out of office hours making the process on arrival very difficult the room eventually had to be booked with another credit card and photos of proof of id signature and the authorisation form had to be emailed over before the booking was accepted wasn t ideal on a sunday evening after travelling to the hotel the room was also at the front of the hotel on a busy and very loud road the outer window was open and it didn t seem like it could be accessed through the inner window
