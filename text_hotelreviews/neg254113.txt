though previous times had been quite good this time the bathroom flooded due to rain coming through a fan on the ceiling couldn t believe it when came back late in the evening went downstairs as there is no phone in the room the receptionist said she couldn t do anything as the person who could fix it was not able to come at pm she said had never happened before which i don t believe as in london rains every other day the blind wouldn t work so the light woke me up at am and was freezing cold as one window wouldn t shut horrible night
