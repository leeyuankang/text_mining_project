breakfast only started at and i had to leave the hotel for yet i had paid for breakfast they didn t make this clear that it started so late they are not suitable for business travellers the wi fi didn t work the kettle was missing from my room there were no glasses a light fitting was hanging off the wall the mattress was sunk and in desperate need of replacing the floor was dusty and dirty the secondary double glazing was broken so there was a gap which made it sound like the window was open despite wearing ear plugs i didn t sleep a wink the room was freezing and the heater was placed by the window which is normal i guess but had drapes over the top of them so when the heater was turned on there was a burning smell the blind was broken reception wasn t particularly friendly in the morning when i left didn t even ask if i had good stay will never stay here again
