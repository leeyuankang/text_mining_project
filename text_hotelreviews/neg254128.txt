when we came in there wasn t a cot for my daughter the next day they put one in and it was too small besides the fact that they didn t prepare the cot she ended up sleeping with us the whole time they insisted in giving towels when we were no cleaning services and the bath was more a cat bath than a real bath no water pressure at all
