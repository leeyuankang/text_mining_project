not sure how this compares with other hotels in london as have only ever have spent nights in two of them but i found the room very small and basic the shower could use a thorough clean with descaler the sink was clogged when we arrived got fixed immediately i have to say the curtains were flimsy and torn the fridge was wedged awkwardly in the wardrobe there was an odd discrepancy between nice and clean linen for example and a relatively new floor but other bits that were in need of upkeep
