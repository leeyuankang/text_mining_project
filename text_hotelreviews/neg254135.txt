the room needed some attention firstly there were only voile window dressings fine during the day but in the evening when trying to sleep let light in from the street lamp outside the window and also when the sun rose so did we the room we had also faced the busy street and without decent double glazing the street noise combined with the lack of curtains meant we didn t get much sleep the bathroom while clean on the surface need a make over chipped items a tap that needed repairing and lots of limescale on the shower doors and around the taps etc and mould in the shower on the grouting there were wall lamps in the room that didn t work and the bedside lamps had usb leads but only one usb socket to plug it into so that s the room then onto breakfast quite an experience and not in a positive way the hot food well the eggs and hash browns were ok but the sausages were tinned hot dog sausages the mushrooms were insipid and there wasn t any bacon at all continental breakfast consisted of some plastic cheese squares slide cucumber and tomato and bizarrely egg mayonnaise sandwiches there were only two seat tables in the breakfast room which was in the basement difficult for the family of three that turned up while we were eating breakfast coffee and tea were served from thermos flasks and orange juice and milk room temperature from jugs left on the side so overall not a great experience overseas visitors please note not all uk hotels are like this
