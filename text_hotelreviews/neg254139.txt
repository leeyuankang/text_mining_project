i am really fed up of these types of hotels that charge as if they are really good but they are actually cr p the sink was blocked the shower was so slow that it took a full half an hour to use the bed had a huge indentation in the mattress so that you couldn t actually sleep without getting a back ache the breakfast was awful people fighting over the small amounts on offer avoid this hotel
