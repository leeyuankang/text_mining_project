no toiletries in room on arrival no tea bags on second day to replace the ones i d used on first night and nothing to stir tea coffee with the shower door didn t close or seal properly resulting in the whole bathroom floor flooding the only window in the room was onto what i believed was an internal stairwell of the hotel so there was no window to open for fresh air as the stairwell was lit all night this left the room pretty much lit up too as the curtain was so thin
