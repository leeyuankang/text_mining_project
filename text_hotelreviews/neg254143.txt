the breakfast was good but it was served far to late is to late most hotel start serving breakfast at even would do the last morning i had to leave the hotel by latest so had to go without breakfast which is really annoying if it is included in the price when i arrived the lady at the reception was very unfriendly the bathroom was dirty the room tiny the internet did not work there was not a drinking glas the bedside lamp did not work i had asked for a room on an upper floor but was put in a room at the ground floor i think i can say it was the worst hotel i have ever been in the only good thing was the location
