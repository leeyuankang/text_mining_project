it s a wierd one there s so much potential but cleanliness was really poor the room hadn t been dusted in weeks and i found someone s false nail in the wardrobe the sheets also smelt of chlorine and some areas are in need of a face lift the worst bit was breakfast it was a crammed room dingy and poor quality food definitely not worth the price i paid
