the girls at reception were ok enough but didn t greet you unless you spoke to them first they kind of looked at you as to ask what you wanted to check in of course but were lovely once they got you sorted the breakfast was in such a small tiny room that had all us guests cramped together no bacon or sausages to be seen at the buffet but an otherwise good range of breakfast things eggs beans hash browns tomatoes mushrooms toast french toast cereal yoghurt etc the woman hosting breakfast was super moody to everyone though ah well you get what you pay for and she wasn t unpleasant at breakfast
