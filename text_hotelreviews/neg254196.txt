i stayed in room the shower cubicle is disgusting years of grime around the doors and down the side the shower head itself was clogged with scale and slime the bathroom sink was blocked and so back filled with water and dirt the bed is awful two single beds put together one really lumpy and the other with a big sunken part in the middle clearly very old and knackered the duvet was so thin it was more of a sheet i had to double it over for warmth as you can t sleep with the fan on as it s too noisy you can t also hear when the room above flushes their toilet chain it sounds like water is actually pouring into the room the tea and coffee making facility was a couple of cheap branded tea bags and a cup that was dirty and smelled of floor cleaner for more i could have stayed in a premier inn which would have been spotless and comes with a good night guarantee
