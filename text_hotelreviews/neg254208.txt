reception was unattended when i arrived with a note and phone number calling the number just made the phone on the reception desk ring and it was not answered had to wait or so for somebody to return which was not great after a long journey and had to get changed and get to function fairly swiftly i saw the same note a few other times passing reception so appeared fairly common
