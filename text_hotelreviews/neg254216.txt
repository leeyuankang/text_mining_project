i stayed in hotels good and bad luxury and simple and this hotel is the worst in my list let s start with the thing that you cannot easily enter the room bad is located very close to entrance and prevents door to be fully opened see photo no hot water in shower we complained about it to reception and a plumber came after good thing that he fixed and issue but it was the only one good thing during our stay blocked drain in sink see photo broken furniture see photo only one shower towel in double room for two persons didn t even look like a big disaster wifi didn t work properly it asks to enter username password and after that fails with host not resolved message still you can load a web page if you reload it times but i wouldn t call it working wifi never ever it s a hobo jungle not a hotel in center of london
