booked a double room at this hotel because it was closed to marylebone train station which was very convenient but good thing we only stayed one night because the experience wasn t a good one overall the place was a really small and cramped place the room was the tiniest room we have ever seen in an hotel imagine a room as narrow as a double bed and nightstands where the bed was literally next to the entrance door at a first glace the room looked ok but then looking closely we ve noticed dust on the nightstands windows very old and dirty had even toilet paper in between so they could stay closed and then in the bathroom the tap sink had limescale residues and the shower looked too gross the shower caps were full of brownish residues as well as all around the shower and door frames we were too disgusted to even take a shower at a stars hotel we would expect the bathroom to be spotless let s face it there are really good and not expensive bathroom cleaning solutions out there so that is no excuse what so ever next morning we made our way to the basement in a small room obviously at this point where the breakfast area was tables made the place too crowded and tight as people could barely walk around the food was just poor you could feel you are eating cheap food so not impressed at all i wouldn t book here again this didn t feel and looked like a stars hotel at all i recommend adding around more and book a room to a prestigious hotel the distances are not that big anyway between marylebone and city center so you could have a nice walk around and enjoy the beautiful london
