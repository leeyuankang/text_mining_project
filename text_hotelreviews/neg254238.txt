there is a fridge in the room it would be easy and nice to put a couple of bottles of water in there the breakfast room in the basement is a bit claustrophobic and impersonal there were no staff at the dining room door to meet me maybe its just me but a nice good morning a smile and a little explanation of how it works would have been welcome as would real sausages instead of those horrible tinned ones
