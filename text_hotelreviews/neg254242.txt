the shower wasn t very good and there was only one large shower towel even though the room was for two people there were no glasses for water and the taps only really supplied warm or hot water the only other things we weren t the biggest fans of was that the lift could only really fit one person in luckily we are both quite small and also the breakfast could have been slightly better it was wasn t bad considering the price of hotels in central london we wouldn t rule out booking again but would possibly look elsewhere beforehand
