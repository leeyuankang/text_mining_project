there was quite a lot of noise and this disturbed my sleep one of the nights mornings breakfast was very understaffed and you need to queue for a table once you have a table you then need to wait a very long time for food at the beginning of our stay this was a really problem but at the end it seemed to be working a little better the problem really was understaffing because the lady working the breakfast table somehow managed to keep her calm and was wonderful despite being pulled in a thousand directions
