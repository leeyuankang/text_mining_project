breakfast was disappointing we sat down and were asked what we wanted for drinks i have a caffeine intolerance so i asked for caffeine free tea the reply i got was yes but i ll have to go upstairs for that so i felt a bit of an inconvinence after that she returned with an espresso which is quite the opposite so instead of saying anything i helped myself to the fresh orange juice there was little choice of food we got asked what we wanted without having seen a menu our choice was scrambled or fried eggs they came on a small plate with nothing else i asked for toast to accompany this and we were given one slice each
