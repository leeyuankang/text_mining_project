the breakfasts were the worst we have ever encountered on monday morning we queued for over minutes just to be able to share a table with another guest there was hardly any food left there was no milk no yoghurt no cheese just a few scraps of cucumber and tomato there was no menu eventually the waitress said that we could have eggs mushrooms and green beans adding sausages later if requested toast was available but only the cheapest white sort tea was dispensed from a teapot that clearly was carried from table to table using the same teabag the following day was slightly better but still scarcely believable the man on reception shrugged his shoulders and gave the impression that this was not an unusual occurrence the shower in the bathroom was rusty and the supposed side jets did not actually reach your body there were used unwashed cups left from the previous resident
