room is truly awful there are no windows except glazing into an internal lobby that meant you couldn t get a dark room its one of the smallest rooms i ve ever been given and i booked as a business traveler but there is no desk as there is no desk or chair in the room the bathroom is tiny and the steps to the shower are downright dangerous i ve gotten wetter in the rain compared to the shower all in all very poor value for money and not for the business traveler
