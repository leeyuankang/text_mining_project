the girl at the reception was very unkind at arrival wanted us to pay for the whole stay nights in advance very odd as you normally pay when you check out and not when checking in standard answer to everything hotel policy we agreed to pay the first night in advance but she insisted on paying the following nights before next morning and she left a message on my voicemail to remind and come to the desk immediatley furthermore the curtains in the room didn t block the light at all and the airco didn t work found some trash on the floor from the previous guests no cups in the cupholder in the bathroom the room in itself was small but nice but that didn t make up for all the other things
