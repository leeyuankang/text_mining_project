everything else i was booked in room and the air conditioner was not working upon checkin upon request one of the front desk staff came in and tried to fix it and assured me it would be fixed in minutes minutes later the ac was still not working and i was about to fall sick upon further request the front desk staff tried calling maintenance who took their own sweet time the entire checkin saga continued for close to hours during which time i was waiting in their lpungent finally the ac did start working and from there on the experience was ordinary all in all it would have been an ok experience if the start would have been good
