the bathroom was dark and there was no hand soap only shampoo housekeeping came in late and did not bring new towels or even a bag for the dustbin the shower looked amazing at first but there was hardly any water and none of the extra features worked also the room temperature was either freezing cold or too hot changing it was like entering a lottery last the breakfast was a joke fried eggs tasting like rubber cold sausages and beans and the toast might have been in the same room as the toaster but not in it the coffee was good though
