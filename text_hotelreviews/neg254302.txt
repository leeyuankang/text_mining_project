although the bathroom sink tap had good pressure the shower didn t it was probably okay when new but the fancy fittings no longer work we suggest a plain one with better pressure and a soap dish or shelf in the cubicle as well also the wooden skirting around the walls in the main room was missing in some places and was a bit of a hazard otherwise the room was nice
