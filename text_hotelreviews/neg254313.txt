it seems that there are not enough towels in the hotel because we get strange towel sets floor towels instead of hand towels only one bath towel for two persons etc once a staff forgot to empty a bin once to add new tea bags and milk the room was not ever cleaned during our days stay shower panel in the bath has only upper shower and no other options that was not very convenient bathtub had no facility to take a bath shower screen was too small so we always had a water on the floor after the biggest problem is the street noise windows were too thin to keep all day round street traffic noise outside and an area around has several hospitals so ambulances sound also didn t give us a good sleep
