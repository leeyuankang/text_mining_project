there were several issues but the main problem was a non friendly staff member who had completely ruined our staying experience already at the night of the check in we were requested to pay for the entire stay which was surprising as i had always been paying at the check out eventually we agreed that i d pay for the first night paid cash and the rest on the day after he issued us our key cards and we went to our room the next evening i approached the front desk to pay for the rest of the stay where the same guy was on shift while my wife with our toddler went to the room since the kid desperately needed a bathroom i completed the transaction and headed to the room when the clerk indifferently said oh by the way your key is not valid anymore let me issue you a new one in the meanwhile my wife had stumbled upon a locked door and ran back downstairs to find some other toilet they actually locked us outside our room with our luggage inside without any prior warning while we weren t short on the rent any attempt to complain were responded by the dry cliche sorry this is our policy if that wasn t enough when i returned back home i found out that they actually charged my credit card for the entire stay without omitting the first night which was already paid in cash while the amount on the receipt was the correct one in addition the room was heading to the main road which was noisy since it s on a bus route and there was a flickering light on the building next to it which prevented us from opening both the blinds and the windows during the night during one of the nights around the fire alarm went off extremely loudly for at least minutes hell on earth with a confused and panicked toddler and staff without any answers the maid lady was leaving the new towels toilet papers and soaps on out bed instead of the bathroom any requests to the front desk about it didn t assist
