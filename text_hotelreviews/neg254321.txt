the sink was clogged the moment you open the tap the sink drain was logged and one had to wait to allow the water to drain to use the sink most inconvenient the hand held shower was broken unusable the bed mattress was not comfortable at all looking at the price i paid for this night stay i was overcharged definitely and would not recommend this hotel looking to use the toilet facilities also though the staff us aware of these issues they continue to place people in such rooms without fixing the facilities
