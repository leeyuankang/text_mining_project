it was the worst hotel i have ever stayed in london hotel would be the worst option in terms of price vs value there are many more hotels in london within similar price range with this hotel and it is better to not to be deceived from its pictures and reviews we have stayed for nights and our room floor was not wiped even once also floors and all carpets in rooms as well as other places in hotel were always dirty our toilet was not cleaned well before we checked in door and sink were dirty and dusty furthermore the faucet was broken there were some negative comments about the hotel s breakfast but we did not care much about it we believed that we could find something for us in any case but the hotel has really limited number things to eat for breakfast not about variety but literally limited number like only slices of cheese or eggs for whole guests in addition to these there was no bread at all during mornings unfriendly and unhelpful staff especially the reception staff some reviews mentioned that the hotel has a coffee machine in lobby it is really hard to call that room as lobby by the way but during our nights days stay we have not found any available glass to use that machine to drink a coffee and we need to find and ask to the staff to bring us a glass each time which is not so fun one of our room s window cannot be opened and we have to stayed airless room for nights even though we stayed rooms from upper floors
