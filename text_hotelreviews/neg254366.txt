i stayed in one of the single rooms and the problem for me was that they are dark and airless because they face a closed in internal area and the first room had window that couldn t open which made matters worse the hotel should state this clearly in the rooms description in the first room i stayed the tv was so high up on the wall above the wardrobe that i couldn t watch it without getting a sore neck the single bed was quite small and a bit sagging which was ok for me but it could be quite uncomfortable for a big person
