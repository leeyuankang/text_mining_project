the day before arrival i rang to check if breakfast was included the man on the phone told me my booking had been cancelled as i had not given my card details and they were now fully booked i had given my card details twice via booking com i never received any communication from them about cancelling my booking i was rather annoyed at this as i was travelling a long way to london for a meeting he did later find that my booking had been reinstated so we did have a room on arrival there was a sign on the reception desk saying they would be back in mins we waited almost mins then my partner wandered through the lounge dining room looking for signs of life and knocked on a door back there the same man i has spoken to on the phone came out and he made some comment about us not being patient which we felt was quite rude so not overly impressed with this guy we would probably stay again due to it being nice hotel and good value for the location shame the staff let it down it made us feel nervous about arriving and passing reception
