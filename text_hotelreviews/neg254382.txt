phone number on the booking confirmation email was not for the correct hotel location it was for a sister hotel located elsewhere so when i called to inquire for the best underground station to arrive there i was told erroneous information costing me time late at night and lbs in cab fare on the phone the rep had named the wrong station options and said the hotel was a or min walk when i exited the station google said min hence the cab when i arrived at hotel the desk clerk recognized the issue when i mentioned it and was sincerely apologetic saying they really need to get that changed no compensation or upgrade was mentioned though i could tell she was empathetic other drawback was that two lights did not work the light over the bathroom sink and a ceiling light over one side of the double bed not sure of the issue but on cable tv only one channel would come through with video my room was in the basement which wasn t a surprise after reading other reviews i wasn t intending to spend much time in the room though working lights and cable would have been a plus i mentioned their pros of helpful staff and good location though i ll prob scan other options next visit
