no heating i arrived for an overnight stay at on a icey january evening and was directed to a room on the basement level the room was pleasant but had a chilly temperature this became more apparent on getting out of my warm clothes and into bed not being able to get warm under the duvet i eventually found window partially open but couldn t close it fully due to a tv aerial lead sitting in the opening i adjusted the wall mounted thermostat to increase the temperature from the stated to there was no effect after an hour and by this time i was in bed close to shivering i then switched on the air conditioning unit above the door and set it too a temperature above again there was no improvement and despite the noise generated from the unit the air emitted remained cold after to minutes unable to sleep due to the room temperature at i found a wall mounted electric heater position behind a desk this thankfully did work but didn t get the room up to a pleasant level i had an uncomfortable sleep thereafter unfortunately this had a significant negative impact on my stay
