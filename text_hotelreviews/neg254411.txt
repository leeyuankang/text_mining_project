the walls are quite thin so although the guests themselves weren t unnecessarily loud or disruptive their actions such as using bathroom was very loud also the sound of doors opening and closing everywhere is easily heard from the basement room we only stayed two nights and needed to be up early so this didn t bother us but i d imagine this would be disruptive for travelers planning to stay longer and needing to lie in etc
