the room was a joke there was a bright light all evening next to the windows which prevent me from sleeping a known issue but the hotel could not switch it off i had chosen the hotel by it s rating but this was incorrect afterwards i saw another person who stayed here with the same bad review which still had a high rating so something is wrong here i really relied on booking for its ratings but after this experience it is clear i can t trust this anymore i m going to complain re this as this was time and money waisted
