i booked a double room and when we arrived it was two single beds seperately we asked for this to be changed when we went out and it still wasn t done when we returned meaning the staff had to change it while we were in the room this was annoying as it was a treat for my girlfriends birthday and our first holiday today you hope everything is perfect the champagne i requested to be in the room on arrival the reception team asked about this infront of my girlfriend on check in if we still required it sadly spoiling the surprise for my girlfriends birthday when they brought the champagne up it was the wrong kind too however very kindly they agreed to give us this bottle complimentary and bring up the correct one too which i really appreciated also breakfast was given complimentary for the last morning of our stay due to the issue with the beds again much appreciated
