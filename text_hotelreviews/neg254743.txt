room service is poor you ask for something and the waiting game begins and usually they just forget about you and never call to update you if it s not possible to meet your needs asked for bathroom slippers for whole stay later when i insisted they said out of stock lol staff have big smiles unless u ask for a hour late checkout you get the no with a smile i would appreciated better communication skills plus they keep putting blame on their busy and room shortage and it shows online they have plenty of ready ones to be booked weird attitude rooms are a bit old with stains on the floor pictures and square meters doesn t match when we left i had to put my luggages in the car by myself and believe me when i say my discontent is only reflected in here i wonder what type of service i would had if i would asked for basics of a star hotel
