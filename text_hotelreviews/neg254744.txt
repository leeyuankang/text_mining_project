this was no suite you walked right into the bedroom and then there was a small area with a kitchen and a table with dining chairs ridiculous the bath was large and had a separate tub and shower but the shower was dangerous as you stepped out onto wet marble plus i have never seen a shower that had no place to put your soap and shampoo except on the floor did i mention that the paint was peeling in the shower and then there was this lovely terrace without a stick of furniture i guess we could have taken the kitchen chairs outside finally the staff had a wonderful ability to not understand or care about our issues or needs
