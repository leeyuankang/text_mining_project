we picked this hotel as it was very close to the hammersmith underground station however the air conditioning in our room didn t work the entire time we were there it worked in other rooms lobby and common areas at the time london was experiencing unusual heat and humidity the room didn t have any windows exasperating the issue we were going to stay four nights but cut it short to two given the ac issue we complained several times to management and their excuse was they couldn t find a mechanic that works weekends we countered we paid for a room with air conditioning we found a room in another hotel for the other nights and wanted to get a refund from the hotel at first they balked but then processed the refund if not for the ac issue we d give them stars
