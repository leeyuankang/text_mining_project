we had a problem with luggage storage hotel confirmed before our stay that they do have luggage storage facilities but when we got there we were advised we could not leave our bags in storage reception staff and hotel manager refused to help us in anyway other than to say we could store our luggage elsewhere and pay for it ouselves we asked the hotel to pay the cost of offsite luggage storage they flat out refused customer service by hotel manager was appalling we advised hotel manager that we would have to speak to his head office about the poor service he was providing us his response go ahead we cancelled our future booking at this hotel and booked into another hotel minutes down the road for the same cost who were happy to store our luggage for free
