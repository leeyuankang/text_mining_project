we booked room for people adults and child old with double bed and sofa bed but got double room with the small folding bed that was located right in the middle of the small room and almost touching the floor after long discussion about difference between sofa bed and folding bed at the reception we got offered second single room for our daughter for one night with the promise that we will get proper room for of us on the second night despite the change of room for second night room was not appropriate for people it was so small that we barely had room to navigate through the room pictures on the site that advertise the rooms are not corresponding the reality money charged are not reflected in the room facility and service the only positive is a location very disappointed and the trip overall was ruined by the all room booking and movements from one room to another also it would be good to notified customer that they have to pay full price at the check in and also that hotel will take at the check in deposit for the room equipment
