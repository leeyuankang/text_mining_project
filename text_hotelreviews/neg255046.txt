refused first room a box without windows second room adequate but very small thoroughly disappointed when going to bed found a large dangerous piece of broken bed spring sticking up vertically through edge of mattress clearly it had been in this condition for some time as large hole worn in side of mattress as it was very late decided to report in morning but had to try and avoid throughout night when reported to staff they were apologetic and transferred us to a better room for our second night disappointed as would have expected better housekeeping from a best western would point out staff very courteous and helpful
