my room was smelling of mildew and the bed covers had a very caustic smell i must admit i stayed there but if i had another option i would found another hotel i had a terrible headache in the morning and noted that it left after a time once i was away from the room reception staff were also very off putting must admit it did not give a welcoming feeling
