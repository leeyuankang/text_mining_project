i ve stayed here times and now know the rooms differ considerably in size and price my first room was lovely reasonable size and a reasonable price second room i upgraded to the executive room but the only difference seemed to be a chair and aparrently the bedding is a different material this time i paid more but was very disappointingly put in a small room on floor with a vaulted ceiling and very little space the desk was unusable due to all the things on it kettle et al brochures etc but even moving them off left a space too small to use with a laptop you had to dangerously stretch the hairdryer cord to get to a mirror plus there was some sorted of alarm that beeped every minutes through the night i will stay here again but will try to reserve one of the rooms i had on my first visit
