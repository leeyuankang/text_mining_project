we were given a room with a broken bed which folded up every time someone sat on it we were initially told that all that could be done for us was to transfer to a hotel in another area which well after midnight is not what anybody wants to hear in the end one of us had to sleep on the floor for the night however we were offered a free upgrade the following day and a cheap bottle of house wine for our troubles
