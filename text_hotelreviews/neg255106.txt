room was small but i guess this is normal in london city center very noisy noise from the street and from other rooms poor breakfast selection and not very good quality products would expect more from a hotel reception is located on the floor and there is a lift on the ground floor which can go directly to the rooms floor so anyone can just come in from the street take the lift and go to the guests floor even though there is a written message inside the lift that it will only go up to the floor reception after i didn t find it very safe in my booking confirmation it was written that payment should be done at the check out then when i wanted to pay in cash at the check out they say it was not possible and that my credit card was already charged
