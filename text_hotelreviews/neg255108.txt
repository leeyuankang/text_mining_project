we checked in without problems went out to do some sightseeing returned to drop out bags off and there was a baby crib in our room booked for adults no extra duvet mug towels i flagged this up to the staff who assured me this would be organised while we were out that evening in returning to the hotel late at our key cards didn t work i reported this to the staff who simply asked me how i was paying no apologies no attempts to give new cards i paid quickly this was not how i would expect to be greeted late in the evening when i ve already checked in the booking was linked to booking com so i would hardly have gotten away without paying after we got into our room the baby bed had been removed and sofa bed pulled out no duvet extra towels or mug so we had to go back to reception and ask for these again breakfast was okay toast and cereal nice that it is free if it wasn t i wouldn t pay for it though okay as a short stay hotel but really too expensive for what it is i ve stayed in the nearby novotel for less before and had a much better experience would not stay here again
