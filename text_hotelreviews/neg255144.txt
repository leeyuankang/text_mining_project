we booked a delux room for one night the bed and room is ridiculously tiny trying to walk around the bed there is a wall right up against the front of the bed so there s only about inches distance to the wall so you have to walk sideways to go around to the other side of the bed it s so narrow i stubbed my toe on the center front leg of the bed the hotel doesn t even give you any bar soap or small shampoo conditioner they only have a generic soap dispenser on the wall but the absolute worst part of our experience was the really bad chemical smell when we entered the room we complained to the manager as soon as we checked in but he just told us there are no other rooms available and didn t even offer to spray air freshener or anything my business partner who i was traveling with was staying in the room next door and he also had the same exact sickly toxic smell in his room we had to keep the window open all night just to be able to breathe the location was good for our business meeting but really bad to catch a taxi
