the double room was extremely small we couldn t open the bathroom door properly as it was blocked by the bed situated literally in front of the bathroom door the room was a bit dark with only roof window which we could not keep open because of pigeons walking on the roof breakfasts were a bit poor and it seemed the staff was not paying too much attention to refilling the food having a british breakfast option it s london after all would be a great added value
