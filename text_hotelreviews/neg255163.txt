the breakfast could be a little better i hate the arrangement for making toast where you have to stand by the machine feeding your bread in alongside everybody else also there is a machine for giving coffee drinkers exactly what they want but for us tea drinkers we have to make do with hot water and a tea bag in a cup i realise every hotel seems to have these arrangements but they are still a drawback
