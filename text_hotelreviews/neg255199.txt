the room was very cramped and i wouldn t expect to have my head in the sink whilst using the toilet we also wanted a drink in the bar when we got back to the hotel at pm but there was no one around the bed was very hard there was no vending machines selling bottles of drink the view from our window as of a small square courtyard which contained brooms and cleaning equipment
