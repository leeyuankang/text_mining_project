not sure why the hotel had leaflet that mentioned being environmentally friendly with regard to the use of towels as our towels were either replaced everyday or folded up and returned to their original place under the sink if indeed refolded didn t like that at all i ensured we kept our separate towels hung up so we could reuse them each day can we have normal coffee sachets in room instead of the chocolate coffee flavour
