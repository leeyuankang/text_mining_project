room was awful no coffee machine as advertised seperate bathroom and toilet is a bad idea and there was no wash basin on toilet coffee making facilities were poor as there was no milk and the cups were paper not even proper cups the strange bird noises that are used to scare pigeons away is very annoying and disturbing and prevents an afternoon nap for the price of the room i would have expected better i couldn t even open the window more than an inch to get some fresh air onto the cramped and stuffy room not good
