the queue for the bar on saturday night was epic stood in excess of minutes to get served drink prices also quite expensive the balconies aren t for the faint hearted we were on the floor and it was terrifying there was a gap between the wall and the start of the balcony and the balcony was made up of just some wooden decking boards stuff of nightmares if you are afraid of heights
