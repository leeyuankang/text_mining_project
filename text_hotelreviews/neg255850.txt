i had an issue in my room on the second night of my stay luckily i was out until quite late when i got back to my room it was flooded not only that but there was sewage in the bath and shower from where i have no idea when i went down to reception to advise them of the issue they mentioned my room wasn t the only one and quickly relocated me to another room i was not offered any kind of compensation or offered any assistance to relocate a sincere apology and some form of compensation would in my opinion be the minimum i should have received i had intended to make this hotel my regular place to stay as i will be travelling to paris often however after this experience i am not going to do this
