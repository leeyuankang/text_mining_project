i was woken up at to a very loud piercing fire alarm the hotel was evacuated and had to stand in pyjamas outside for the next half hour i was asked how my stay was on departure i do understand they have to adhere to health and safety regulations however i did mention i was disappointed at being woken up so unexpectedly i did not think the staff member empathised too much and i felt it spoiled my stay as this is not a cheap hotel
