despite being on the floor the street noise was very loud and carried on throughout the night i felt that we were being sold to a lot most of the toiletries in the bathroom were for sale rather than being there to use there was also a tray of items all with a price list in the room it wasn t a cheap hotel so i felt some of these items would have been nice perks rather than added extras also the rooftop bar has a private party when we were there so we couldn t enjoy it
