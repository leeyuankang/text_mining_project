this was billed as a luxury property which was why we booked it for our birthday trip however it is all looks and no substance price lists were to be found in bathroom by kettle etc and very little was included in the expensive price for the rooms whoever thought the metal cups were a good look obviously didn t try to make a hot drink and then burn their hand on the metal handle no spoons just silly wooden stirrers bin and sheets only changed every three days for a luxury hotel it offered little more than a premier inn at a fraction of the price very disappointed not what we wanted for a special occasion
