there was a fault with the lock on my door which meant i couldn t lock it reception explained that the locks had just been upgraded so perhaps this one was just an anomaly the biggest disappointment was the shower which didn t drain properly and flooded part of the bathroom floor also the bose speaker had an unpredictable connection mechanism i mentioned all these points in my feedback when i checked out and the staff did apologise
