the dim and coloured lighting does hide some rough joinery work they preauthorised from my card at checkin presumably in case i was tempted to steal from the minibar which was insulting we arrived on a cold day to a cold room we were heading out for the evening so we left a card in the slot and the heating on maximum we returned just after to a cold room and obviously non functioning heating by the maintenance guy had got it working and delivered a heater this wasn t how we wanted to spend our time though obviously the room wasn t checked properly beforehand we were offered complimentary breakfast in compensation which was fair although nobody communicated this to the front desk who tried to charge for it on check out the full english breakfast for is fine but is more an assembly of ingredients than a well prepared meal there is an atrium above a bar lounge and the rooms are arranged in a circles around the atrium this means that you hear people laughing and shouting in the bar when your room door is shut although this is only annoying when you eventually get to bed and can hear it quite plainly the bathroom is ok but the shower controls are hard to get right the free newspaper is the evening standard which is a free paper anyhow the trend for hotels to withdraw services to save make money e g communal coffee making facilities no porter bellboy makes for disappointment because the lack of staff shows i don t think the zetter was good value at a night
