i value comfort cleanliness and yes a bit of luxury over hipster cool the rooms are full of twee nonsense all of it for sale there s a pencil sharpener on the wall for some reason there are random bottles of liquor strewn about that you can purchase the minibar is in a little ikea style wire box on a shelf my room had a giant tumblr quote blazoned six feet high on the wall along with some sort of trendy photo collage it s all trying very hard to be cool to me it sort of felt like i was in a twenty five year old s messy apartment in williamsburg i d prefer all of their little useless accoutrements be stuffed into a cabinet and leave the room looking a little more pristine rather than feeling like i m walking into someone else s see and be seen apartment where they re really obviously worried their tindr date is going to judge them by the stuff they keep around the beds were on the floor for some reason which looks kinda hipster cool in a japanese minimalism feng shui way but it s honestly not that convenient there was a vinyl record player in the room again for some reason no way to plug in any other kind of music from a phone or bluetooth and the record selection was abysmal with a few scratched off brand eighties non hits and absolutely no modern norwegian black metal i d stay here again on work s dime for the location but if i was spending my own money i d want a bit more actual niceness and a bit less funky airbnb atmosphere for the amount i spent
