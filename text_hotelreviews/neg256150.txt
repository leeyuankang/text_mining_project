there were so many firstly we had asked ahead for fibre pillows not feather as my husband has an allergy not only did we not get those but later at night when we asked for them we were sent totally ruined bumpy bundles of fibre passing off as pillows i was shocked at the condition of the pillows the houseboy who brought it up said these were the best they had ultimately we bought pillows from john lewis which the housekeeping girls will attest to as they saw them in our beds daily when they cleaned the room secondly the hk cleaning services are very erratic apparently the girls change daily according to them some of the cleaners are really bad we had problems with dirty utensils in spite of my soaking them in soapy water before they came for cleaning inadequate toilet paper room stock of glasses being removed from the room no supply of shower gel each request complaint was given to the hk desk so if they maintain records you ll find it thirdly you advertise saying satellite tv but what you provide is freeview channels we regularly live in london each year for months in the autumn so we know what satellite means not only that half the channels were not coming we had to complain to hk they sent maintenance men several times and the problem only got resolved during the last few days of our stay that too not fully some channels still didn t come and satellite channels never did you don t provide those the lighting system is bad there is no way you can read in bed either the overhead lights come on very bright scene or they are off also other small irritants there is no bedside tables no dressing table and no power point for the hairdryer in the bathroom i had to sit at the kitchen counter to do my hair daily
