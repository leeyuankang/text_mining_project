the staff on arrival weren t clear in fact one told me my booking wasn t with them and i was at the wrong hotel also at the time of booking i d been informed the room was paid when in fact it had only been reserved the staff were quite rude handling this situation when i got to my room i called for room service as i was shattered i was told by a member of staff that i couldn t order anything as the kitchen was closed she was rude in the manner in which she said this and this ultimately left me feeling frustrated i went out to grab something and used a plate within the room there was a can opener on top of the plate which was encased in food or remains of something this made me feel sick someone had obviously not checked the cleanliness of this area in some time great location staff could do with customer service training i would never stay there again
