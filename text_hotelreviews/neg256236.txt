unfortunately i myself am not very good at walking and it is too far from everything if you are slightly challenged so taxis are a must as nothing was in walking distance for me the hotel was extremely overpriced charging top rate hotel prices for their drinks etc i dont mind paying for quality quantity but sadly this was not the case here the sinks in our room did not hold water as the plugs didnt work we reported this someone came and had a look but nothing was done about it and it was extremely frustrating immediately opposite from us across the water was a nightclub and boy oh boy did you need the ear plugs that they supplied in the room not only the music thuding but the language from some of the unsavoury characters this hotel is suited to people on a business trip and only having to stay a night it is for the young and trendy and those who want to stay up all hours
