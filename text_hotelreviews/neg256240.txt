the bar area becomes a late night club which is just noticeable in the bedroom but the biggest problem was the boat on the opposite side of the river which had a rave every night we were there but the ear plugs provided by the hotel probably for their own noise did not get close to cutting out the noise so we had no sleep the answer is probably go and join in but it did not finish until the next day
