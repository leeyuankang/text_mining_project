we stayed here as a special occasion for the price of the hotel we were disappointed the staff were not very helpful at explaining how the hotel and facilities worked the air con was broken and no alternative measures were taken to make the room less hot e g offering a fan or offering us a complimentary service for the inconvenience the staff didn t really apologise for this and only explained the issue when we arrived in the room the temp was degrees on the night we stayed also the shower temperature stat didn t work and the usb controls in our room didn t function a welcome sheet in the room explaining how the room facilities work and the opening hours of the bar and pool etc would have been appreciated we felt a bit lost and didn t feel very welcome the bar area is very chic but we waited a very long time to be served at the bar which is expensive and gave up on our second round of drinks as we waited over half an hour for them to arrive with some tweaks this could be a very good hotel but the customer care needs some attention
