they asked my mobile phone upon check in i guess for marketing purposes and with a cheap excuse i refused they shouldn t do it it s a bit isolated next restaurants are min walk important most of the rooms have a problem with the windows they have double windows but they don t seal properly so it s very noisy inside with traffic noise i changed room just to find exactly the same problem in the new one they must fix it
