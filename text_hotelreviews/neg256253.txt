unfortunately there is a nightclub directly across the river it opens on friday evening and goes hours a day until monday morning we stayed friday and saturday nights windows very well insulated but you could feel the thump of the music bass line all night long the second night we didn t even notice it though if you stay monday to thursday no issues at all
