i thought the breakfast was very poor if i am honest you pay euros to have such a limited selection i have paid euros in much more expensive hotels and the breakfast was incredible you just didn t know what to have was very disappointed in this if i am honest also we had to wait ages for some warm cooked food as they had forgot to order some bits
