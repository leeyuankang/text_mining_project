the whole experience was amazing nothing was amiss and the personnel is really friendly and reactive to your every need i arrived around midnight and asked for fresh water and they brought it to my room right away the next morning i had guests and they were able to share a delicious breakfast with me since the hotel has a non resident open policy i fully recommend this choice be it for business or leisure worth the price
