we booked room for two people but were treated as a solo traveller there was only one towel hanging and other hidden in the closet only one mini bottle of water toiletries for one it was a bit odd i actually like that they don t exchange toiletries every day to throw away soap after using it just once like usually hotels do but during our nights stay i would appreciate changing bottles that really are empty the bottle of hair conditioner was damaged and couldn t be opened so we throw it away but it was never replaced with another one the room facing courtyard is a bit dark but these are all small things nothing major to complain about overall our experience was great
