the hotel can be recommended to somethings who wants to party with other of the same age every night the ground floor is full of young hipsters either at a co working desk og chatting and drinking with friends this time there was a hen night in the lobby the rooms are loaded with alcohol three times i have stayed at the hotel the fire alarm has gone off in the middle of the night a piercing sound only in one other hotel has this happened to me in copenhagen so i doubt its a rare incident we stayed in deluxe double the first room we were given had windows towards the street and was very noisy the second was peaceful but had just a narrow window out to the backyard proper sound insulation and daylight conditions would improve a lot
