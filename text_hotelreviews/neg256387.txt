we paid euros and booked well in advance weeks prevous a superior room with queen bed bath and they gave us a standard club double box room with just a shower tried their luck wonder how many other customers get treated like this as not everyone would realise i was disgusted to be defrauded by the staff who gave me the keys to the club double when i complained and refused to take the room they had given my room to someone else as their was no supreme room available so they had to stick us in the waiting room as all the rest of the hotel was fully booked i was now wasting valuable holiday time waiting around looking at other local hotels while they tried to find another room when they did they then realised that particular customer had rebooked a second night then they found us a suit but it needed cleaning which was a hour wait we was supposed be checked in at and out by our day was completely destroyed by this only compensation was a drink from the bar while we waited till to be able to unpack our luggage and get changed i was totally embarrassed and humiliated by the hotels dishonest behaviour id warn people to take a tape measure and make sure that the room they pay for is actually the room cause i bet loads of people don t even realise this hotel is behaving in this manor
