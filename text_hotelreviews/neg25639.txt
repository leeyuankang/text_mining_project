staff weren t helpful we paid a lot of money for our room and no information was given to us when checking in they told us no info about breakfast restaurants bars check out time etc very un pleasant at reception the guy just took our money and told us we have to pay deposit on card and if we didn t have card we would have to pay in cash makes no sense to have different amounts cash card we stayed from a friday to monday and we had to ring reception ourselves to find out why our room hadnt been cleaned in two days on the sunday it was awful
