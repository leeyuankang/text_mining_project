the hotel pre authorized my card upon checkout i paid in cash after i left the hotel i called the credit card company they let me know that the hotel had to un release the amount for it to go back in the card when i called the hotel the employee at the reception was so rude she didn t understand what i meant when i told her she needed to un release the amount so i told her send me an email that states i paid in cash the credit card company needed it she told me in minutes i called more than times no use no email after calling bookings com they helped me resolve the issue and the hotel employee sent me the email the next day seriously why would she say that she will send me the email in minutes and every time i called she kept saying yes yes in minutes and even when i told her please let me speak to the manager she told me i am the manager honestly it was really bad behavior from a manager the reception staff were really bad no place for the luggage the toilet was separate from the sink and shower area i would have preferred it to be all in one place
