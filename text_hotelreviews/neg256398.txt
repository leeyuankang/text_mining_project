on the day of my checkout i was heckled by your staff at the reception and asked to pay euros for using the mini bar i had specifically asked in very clear words the hotel concierge mathieu on august about my full liability and if i was liable to pay anything additional other than the amount of euros mentioned in my booking he very specifically mentioned that i had to pay city tax extra and nothing else apart from that further for your information i did not use my mini bar and even had one of your room attendants empty it on the very first day so i could not have used the mini bar as being claimed by you i had to specifically give a written request to confirm from the room attendant that i had indeed had her empty the mini bar i have attached the written request here i have also attached the bill for the hotel stay and had it countersigned by the staff at the reception where his cashier id is also mentioned i had to catch a flight that day and your hotel caused me aggravated mental harassment further my sponsoring company had arranged for a bus from their seminar venue to take us back to the airport due to my precious time being wasted by your staff i missed that bus and had to take a cab to the airport which cost me around euros for which none other than your hotel is responsible this is when i had specifically asked your hotel staff the previous night to give me a receipt of the bill and clear my account as i would be leaving early morning but they told me that the formalities wont take more than mins and would be done in the morning itself even after requesting you i was delayed by your staff
