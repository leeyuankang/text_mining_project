check in to find because i did not have the credit card i paid with the payment has to be reversed and another card used i thought this was a bit over the top as i had my passport as id it meant i was up for currency exchange always not in my favour plus cc charges for three transactions but after dealing with that we discovered on going to our twin room that it was not a deluxe room as was booked no bath i had specifically booked and paid for a delux room for this reason the receptionist yes same one insisted they did not have delux twin rooms with bath until i showed her the room description on booking info we were given a suite with no extra cost but would have to wait till the occupier checked out pm we were getting into our room mind you the suite was just a slightly bigger room with a couch in it but it did have a bath we were compensated with a drink voucher but the whole business put a really dark shadow over what was a long awaited much anticipated trip so be careful with checking what you book with what you get in this hotel
