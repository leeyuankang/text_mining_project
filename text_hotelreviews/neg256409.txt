i thought the breakfast was very expensive i only wanted scrambled eggs however this cost for the cooked breakfast option included in this was many different meats as well as fruit cereal toast and pastries the express breakfast was for pastries toast and juice while the variety was good i felt is was overpriced if you only wanted to have one or two things off the menu
