we stayed at first floor at first night and woke up at am in the night with a horrible vibration sound in the room they said it was air condition but it was switched off anyway they offered to switch the room so we moved to a different room in the midnight the sound was still on but less than the other room they upraded our room in the second day to second floor which was ok
