we arrived on a saturday unbelievably the restaurant wasn t open and worse still room service menu was unavailable and only limited snacks served we were on stopover on our way back to australia and were too tired to eat out so while we loved the hotel the rooms the staff and the location next time we would probably choose somewhere that at least provided room service
