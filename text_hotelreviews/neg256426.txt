i was staying at this hotel not for the first time and previous experiences were not bad rooms are really small including junior suite even in comparison to traditionally small hotel rooms in paris this time first of all they could not find a blanket that seemed as a joke in a star hotel for such price they could manage to have a reserve one especially seen that the hotel was far from being full while asking to the reception if they could take a blanket from a non occupied room they said that someone could come and they cannot take blankets from other rooms time was around midnight come on there won t be a bus coming full of people at midnight and book all the remaining rooms this time we were staying one night at room which is at the end of the floor it has a view on the small side street named leo delibes it is quiet but starting from in the morning on saturday a truck blocked the street to load and unload stuff for the hotel needs this was done by trolleys that made lots of noise both on the street paving stone and inside the building as our room was located just above the service entry they finished at actually we could not sleep at all because of that really bad experience unfortunately
