there are some rooms in this hotel that don t have good wi fi access hence i had to move rooms three times over nights to find decent access to the internet downstairs facilities are shared with local people using the hotel for hot desks leaving no room for paying guests i couldn t invite anyone to the hotel for a drink because you couldn t be guaranteed a seat such a shame for a great looking hotel they just forgot to cater for their in house guests
