waited half an hour upon arrival with noone to speak to as desk clerk was out for lunch booking stated no charge except pre auth of pounds prior to arrival full amount for the night was charged to the card prior to arrival desk clerk then tried to say this was the deposit and that he still had to charge me for the room we disagreed then after arguing infront of another delayed guest he agreed to complete the transaction for the night and hold only a pound bond when i suggested the booking info be updated he said it was right clearly not the website and all booking com correspondence has said the funds will be released within working days we are now onto the working day since leaving and several emails to the hotel no response and the amount is still pending on my card not trying to nitpick but very clearly misled on a number of fronts a real shame considering the room was very nice climate controlled and the bed extremely comfortable
