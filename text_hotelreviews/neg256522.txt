the main downfall was that the floors were too slippy which resulted in a few falls and the slippers that were provided were not non slip either but we managed to get around it by having to walk cautiously and in small steps on first glance the room looked immaculate and tidy however we found the bedside drawers had not been cleaned dusted and the curtains had not been washed changed as they had yellow stains on them let s just say someone had a really good time with their partner the bathroom was very nice inside the only things i would say is i would have liked a floor mat as the sink was too small to wash your face in without spilling water so we had to use one of our towels as a mat the room should have had an air freshener spray as we had ordered a take away and the smell lingered for the full day as it was a hot day and there wasn t a breeze with the window open we noticed the receptionists would almost hide behind the desk and just look up to see who was entering the building and were not very helpful when it came to asking for basic items such as a pencil sharpener for a start but they were nice when they would speak to you
