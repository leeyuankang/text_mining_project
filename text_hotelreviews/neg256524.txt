the room was small may be in meters even ok but the way everything placed makes it very uncomfortable to move around shower door didn t closed till the end water in the sink did not pass and was stuck there for around half an hour after every use and was full in minutes so easier was not to use equipment in the kitchen very poor for example only one small spoon even we were people staying terrible audibility you can hear your neighbours not only coming home at night but also going to toilet or washing in the shower the most unpleasant was when one of the personal guy came and nock to our door in the morning even we had a sign do not disturb after we said we are sleeping he still demanded to open the door because he wants to talk and all this were because he wanted to say that we were too loud in the night well we heard all our neighbours every night and mornings too other staff however was nice and polite i would stay again in the same area but i would never come back to the same hotel
