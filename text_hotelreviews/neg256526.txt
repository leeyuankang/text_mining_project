there is no getting past the apartment being tiny i had to sit on the end of the bed and pull down a shelf to get any sort of desk to work on the bed was also tiny i am only but my feet hung over the end i felt it was very expensive for what was akin to student accommodation the wifi was awful not good enough to hold a webex or skype call on as the connection kept dropping out
