if we would have known there was no wifi at all in the hotel we never would have booked it in the first place when we checked in we were told we re having a little bit of trouble with the wifi it may be slow but when we later complained that we had zero wifi we were told by the staff that they were frustrated with it too because they had to go across the street just to transmit business information this demonstrates a much greater awareness of the problem than just it may be slow this may seem like a nit picky problem but with work responsibilities communicating with the family back home and most of all planning our stay in london needing to walk several blocks to wetherspoon s every time we needed the internet was extremely frustrating
