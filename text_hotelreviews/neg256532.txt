the room was small as the booking com genius they did not allow me to extend even one hour check out time i can t see the benefits of being a genius besides after i told the reception that the hair dryer in my room didn t work their first reaction was i was the one who broke it good attitude to guests but it was quite okay that they finally found a proper one quite average experience just worth its discounted price
