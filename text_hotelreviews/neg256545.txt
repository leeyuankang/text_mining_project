the staff and in particular the cleaners do not speak a word of english they have no regard for the guests and make excessive noise through out the day the bed was extremely uncomfortable and the matress needs to be changed to something sturdier it felt like we were sleeping on old matress the biscuits provided for your tea and coffee were broken the greatest shock was when i came face to face on three different occasions within a space of minutes with various peeping toms the room was below ground so for natural light and fresh air we had to open the blinds and window the room was aslo extrememly small so condensation from the bathroom engulfs the whole room opening the window meant that anyone who wished to could see into the room and so they did not the general public as i would have thought but the hotel s own staff i was getting dressed and they came down a few times to the window i was very angry about that the reception which is street level has a privacy glass but the bedroom which can be seen from outside doesn t how does that make any sense we complained and from what i understood of her poor english the manager would speak to us but obviously that never happened first and last time for us i can assure you i will never stay at this hotel again
