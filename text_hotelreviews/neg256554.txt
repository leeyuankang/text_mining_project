the rooms are quiet small and stuffy and not cleaned well we were given a room in the basement which we asked to change as my partner suffers from clastrophobia and hotel was full understandable yet the next day hotel didn t follow up and always where busy at the desk to change our room we eventually got accustomed to it and opened the windows for air but it made the stay less comfortable
