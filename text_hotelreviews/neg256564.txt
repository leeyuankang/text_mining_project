they should have cheaper prices for the lower floor rooms you can t pay the same price with the other rooms the room was not at all sound proof you could hear each time someone flushes the toilet and could hear footsteps and noise from the corridor overall what i like to have is customer service and people friendly and smiling and eager to assist you instead i had icy cold behavior so i wouldn t book there in the future
