the room is far too small it is like sleeping in a cupboard i cannot stress this enough there is not enough space to move around the bed we are both small people this is definitely not a studio more like a tiny star hotel room the water was not hot enough in the shower and you could not turn it up one morning there was barely any water coming out of the shower it seems if everyone showers at the same time this happens the price is far too high for that size room it should not be sold or advertised as a studio i have stayed in much larger hotel rooms even when it clearly states small hotel room on the advert
