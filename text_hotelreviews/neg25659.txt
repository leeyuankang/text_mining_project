staff at checkin were friendly but fairly useless we arrived before our room was ready and wouldn t be back till late so wanted to have done everything there and then it took ages mins for rooms and people in total to be checked in then when we got back to the hotel at none of it had been done so we had to go through the whole long winded process again and it wasn t much quicker the second time around no real apology offer to take bags to rooms etc also no information about hotel where to get breakfast etc and guests don t get free entrance to the club nights in the basement so if you want to go you have to order tickets not even a discount offered as it s run by a promoter who rent the space from the hotel i assume also sent out of the hotel and back in a side entrance when going for breakfast at hotel restaurant it is open to public so accessible via the road as well as hotel only to see our friends come in the entrance from the hotel not great service poached eggs were like hard boiled eggs and once again the service was painfully slow expected better
