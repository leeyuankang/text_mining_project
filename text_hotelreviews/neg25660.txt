service at breakfast was rather slow it takes a looong time to get a coffee there the lounge was rather noisy in the evening there was a party downstairs and we heard the music well up into our room luckily it ended at a decent hour the hotel in general is stylish and at first glance beautifully designed but suffers from clich hipster empty headedness if you put an expensive rega turntable in every room you might consider not hooking it up to a speaker that sounds like a mobile phone great for product placement i guess but i d have rather payed for something that contributes to the hotel experience i don t really feel the room was worth the money
