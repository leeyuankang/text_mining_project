i asked staff about where to park before my journey over the phone after reading the welcome email details about parking and secondly on arrival to make sure i was ok parked outside the hotel i parked on their recommendation literally outside the main entrance and had a parking fine not great advice parking bays are confusing outside the hotel and pay display area is only spaces across the road and down a side street not what was mentioned by staff when mentioned at check out the staff member shrugged shoulders and said not my problem an apology would have been appreciated i only mentioned it so they could advise guests better in the future out of date uht carton milk in the fridge was like cottage cheese when opened sash window was unlocked on lower ground floor room with easy access from rear courtyard not great for safety of a woman staying on her own glad i checked the windows before bed before leaving my belongings for the day i travelled with two other ladies one had to move rooms because of filthy bathroom what looked like faeces in her shower and the other had a blouse melted by a faulty iron again neither had an apology from staff we asked for the managers name so we could complain in writing and were refused this information from the man in reception and were asked to leave customer service and consideration was zero extremely disappointed
