the room was so very small the net curtains were so long that my husband kept catching his feet in them whilst trying to get into bed through the inch gap there is not enough room for people to move around in these rooms and the bed is very small and the quilt not even a double size unfortunately as the windows are not double glazed the constant noise of traffic is deafening morning and night
