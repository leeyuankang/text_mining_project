expected a little noise given location but as this is a hotel that doesn t stop and there was a private party on the roof terrace there was a little more noise than expected at night and was hard to switch off also due to popularity couldn t get a seat or near the bar in the lobby so had to find somewhere near by for a quick drink pre dinner
