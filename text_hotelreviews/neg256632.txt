we had a room on the lower ground floor which seemed have the plumbing pipes from many rooms running behind the walls in our room which led us to have the noise of flushing toilets and running showers quiet loudly in the room which was a bit like being in a water park or like it was raining i get heavily outside don t know if other rooms in accommodation are the same but i would avoid lower ground
