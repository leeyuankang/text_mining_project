the free wifi is an open network so not really that fast or safe essentially rendering it useless the service at the front desk was very varied but mostly on the curt side we a young couple asked for a quiet room and were assigned a disabled geriatric room with a very inconveniently placed low sink for a guy this joke was probably very popular with the clerks it wasn t a particularly busy weekend so they were bound to have other rooms too on top of this we were overcharged for the minibar only product consumed was a bottle of water but was charged so all in all the exoerience was a very mixed bag for a hotel that prides it self at being excellent in hospitality etc
