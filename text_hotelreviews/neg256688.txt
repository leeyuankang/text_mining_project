the apartments are in a converted traditional house on the main road the double studio was not in main building but outside with its own entrance and down small two flights of steep and narrow stairs towards the basement of the property the stairwell was well lit and well paved but the steps are narrow and those with children or physical health issues will struggle this is ideal if you are fit and want to be left to your own devices as the room has its own entrance however not the safest if it rains it sounds like a big issue but once you re used to it it s ok room was cold and there was a heater which has a limiter so you will not be freezing but may still be a little cold outside is a busy road car horns can be heard on saturday morning as traffic starts to increase wasn t a big issue for me however as i was up getting ready
