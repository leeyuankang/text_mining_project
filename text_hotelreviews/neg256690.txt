whatever you do don t book a lower ground floor bedroom at least not lg as there is another room opposite but below your window overlooks an inside space which has a strong light on all night the blackout curtain is far from adequate and consequently the room is illuminated throughout the night so it is very difficult to sleep unless you can do so in a room that feels like it is constantly at dusk
