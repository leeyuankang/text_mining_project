things that i didn t like was the fact that you don t have enough places were to hang your clothes and so even if they are dirty you have to put them back in the baggage we stayed at the floor which was more or less under the reception and so sometimes in the mornings we could hear the people walking and their trolleys the studios are m far away from the shepherds bush station underground so sometimes it might seems to be to far away until you get used to it near the station you can find a lot of coffee bars as well as starbucks mcdonalds cinema ecc where you can eat breakfast lunch dinner and enjoy london so i guess that is a plus
