we did not really bother but if you are noise sensitive you must be aware that the water system can be heard a bit meaning if someone above or beside you uses shower or toilets you will hear the water rushing through the pipes the kitchenette is fully equiped for people but there are not enough chairs so you have to eat breakfast sitting on your bed we stayed for days and had wonderful weather unfortunately there is no terrace or any place to spend time outside if you return to hotel you need to stay at your room there is also no bar or any lounge area in the hotel the invoice has to be paid in advance upon arrival which we found a bit unusual especially if you stay for days it does not allow you to change your plans and for example leave a day earlier all towels were changed everyday there was no way to indicate to use towels twice to protect the environment even unused towels were changed each day
