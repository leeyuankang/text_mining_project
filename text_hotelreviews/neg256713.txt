although we had a fully stuffed kitchenette the room lacked a proper table and chairs to eat if one decided to cook the triple studio had only one chair and very small coffee table or so for three people but they said that they are considering supplying more chairs to the room and the bathroom sink is too small and narrow to wash your face you can wash only hands in it the hairdryer is strangely fitted in the room in a wardrobe and you cannot take it out to the bathroom which is inconvenient because one usually needs a mirror to dry one s hair the internet kept falling and interrupting every minute but got much better after our complaint it is very important to foreigners like us since we cannot locate places of interest find directions check timetables etc without internet
