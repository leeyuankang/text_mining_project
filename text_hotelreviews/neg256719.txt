it would be nice to be informed that there were a few builders right outside of our room who were doing some building work for the basement of the building this was absolutely shocked for us and immediately i wasn t amused by this at all apart from the builders there were quite a lot dirty bags outside of the room which were part of their building work builders work outside of our room from until or pm in the evening we couldn t lie in a little bit in the morning they were like the alarm to wake us up every morning the problem is builders talked loudly and smoked in front of our window too so that we couldn t open our window at all because we didn t want to hear what they talked about foreign language and smell the cigarette that was the biggest no no for us actually for any customers walk into the building bit heart dropped moment building work makes the front entrance very dusty it also affect my room s cleaniess dust for the first day was bad i had to clean all the surface with wet wipes it is getting bit better from second day of our stay receptionists were fine one of them had to provide water and toilet roll for us which i had complained a few times at the front desk seems quite a thing trying to buy two bottles of water should be easy and acceptable however i did feel receptionist made me feel she has done us a massive favour made me feel well guilty even asked about it which i thought totally wrong i didn t feel i was offered any enthusiastic service which i should have the thing made me laugh was staff seems spent huge amount of time making the shape of towels on the bed however they couldn t be bothered to put enough toilet roll for us and clean the floor properly we accept there will always be good thing and bad thing about a hotel however if hotel had been measured as a star hotel they should have happy staff clean room good service and quiet environment
