deluxe room did not meet the pictures and therefore expectations of the room big differences in quality and size we were extremely disappointed room was on the side of the street which is extremely loud during nights on the weekend as the hotel also kind of functions as a bar club bathroom was not perfectly clean when we arrived service was not good e g had to ask multiple times until we received a second test size sachet of body lotion you could expect two people to get two portions of body lotion though
