i usually stay at the ace a bit and i usually am pretty disappointed by the staff because they tend to get things wrong or they don t follow up etc at ace la they would forget to cancel my credit card guarantee even though i paid cash for those weeks i was there at ace london i sent two parcels to friends in china and the courier company couldn t get a hold of me because the hotel gave them the wrong email addy and thus everything was sent late plus i got charged quite a bit for the international delivery too the ace pdx was the best amongst the in terms of service
