the hotel ran extra holds on my card after i had left meaning that my account had a pending transaction for several hundred pound despite having already paid the full amount for the room staff were incredibly unhelpful in resolving this and on several occasions offered blatantly wrong information the air conditioning in the room didn t work the room was quite noisy and traffic trains can be heard at all hours there was no tea making facilities in the room and the selection for breakfast was quite poor overall very poor value for money
