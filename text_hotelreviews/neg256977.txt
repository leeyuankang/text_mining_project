staff was very unprofessional although some tried to be service minded it did not come natural some were just plain rude in the days we spent at the hotel there was no supervisor or manager present so i guess staff was mainly lost at what to do on the third day they were still asking for our breakfast preferences while there were only few guests the room was very very small the hotel website itself doesn t mention the of the rooms booking com does in london rooms are generally small but at this price at some point the airco did not work and it got very warm in the room degrees celsius according to reviews this is a regular problem but staff started discussion in front of me how to solve this stars it took a while and several discussions with staff and i lost faith but after some persuasion the maintenance guy solved it there are several nicely decorated communal rooms suitable to escape a very small hotelroom if only they were not playing arab music all the time also no alcohol is being served out of respect to the arab culture is hidden somewhere on the website we have stayed in several muslim owned and star hotels in asia and alcohol was usually served out of respect to the multicultural world citizens we saw no one using these rooms anyway
