you could hear the street noise i would recommend replacing the existing windows with some noise insulating ones the staff who welcomed me could have been warmer and friendlier there were few things not functioning in the room e g bathroom heating safer and alarm clock when i mentioned it at the reception they immediately fixed everything however it would have been nicer if they would have checked before my arrival
