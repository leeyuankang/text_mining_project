a hotel functioning purely on style and reputation rather than function and comfort even then not sure an industrial crate counts as style an item used as shelving in the room duvets thin and not warm i could hear the bar music and i was on the floor street noise extremely loud sound proofing should be considered more like an over priced travel lodge with rowdy bar the plug box coming away from wall highlighted to staff but surely this should be noted by housekeeping not to have to be pointed out by a guest no free water in room
