the room was totaly small we had rarely space to walk around the bed we did not have enough space for small suitcases may be it is the smallest room they have in this case i would suggest to reduce roomrate we paid the same price like the rooms we saw on the pictures a those rooms look pretty large we couldn t close the bathroom window and it was getting cold help was promised but nothing happened we were not unhappy to stay only one night
