however the experience was not as good as it seemed the facilities didn t deliver heating in the room was not working and for a star the staff was very rookie in handling the situation i had first reported the problem right after check in and had to push for a follow up until i went to sleep at which point there still was no sound solution a non working extra heater and extra layers of cover at when i pushed for it at checkout they did not know about the issue and when pointed they did apologize which i appreciate however that did not make up for freezing at night
