room was very small on the first night we decided to order a bit of room service which included a cheese board the crackers were soft therefore we barely touched the plate mentioned this only on departure but still had to pay for it the speaker for the tv in the bathroom was faulty for a star hotel i guess i expected more there is just nothing remarkable to say about the place won t be returning
