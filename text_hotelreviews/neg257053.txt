two payments taken from my account did try and tell lady on reception that payment already made however she insisted on taken payment again therefore i am not very happy about this no breakfast despite when i originally booked it said free breakfast didn t pay as poor breakfast package went to cafe round the corner cafe forum and breakfast was great and good price felt the staff were a little awkward
