my room was on the first floor and the trains ran directly below i did not like that they put me there as a first time guest my bed creaked a lot and the robes and towels were very dingy for a luxury hotel so was a bit weary of using them breakfast although complimentary was not brilliant and at room service dinner they did not have s lot of the teas and some of the starters they have on the menu i also didn t realize they did not serve alcohol on the premises which wasn t crucial to me but nowhere did i see that on the site
