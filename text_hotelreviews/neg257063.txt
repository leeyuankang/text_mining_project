the single room is a strange shape this meant that the bathroom sink was tiny not big enough to wash your face deep enough to shave i actually missed when spitting out my toothpaste and spit on the floor the shower stall leaked flooding the bathroom there was nowhere to hang your towel the desk was taken up as a tv stand so i had to work at my bed there is a kitchenette which i didn t need but if someone wanted to use it there were no cups cutlery plates it s there for show it seemed like the room was trying to look impressive rather than be really functional
