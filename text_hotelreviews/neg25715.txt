the room was a bit like student halls but the kids loved that and on saturday night it was very noisy outside late into the night the lobby was often very full of people using the free wifi and we couldn t always get a seat there was always good music playing in the bar but it was a bit noisy and we could hear it in our room we were floors up and i d ask for a higher floor if i stayed again room was a bit like a shop a lot of stuff in the room was for sale at exorbitant prices and we weren t sure what we could couldn t use without paying eg dressing gowns toiletries
