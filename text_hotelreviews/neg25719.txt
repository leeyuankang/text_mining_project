i get this is a hotel that prides itself on being hipster central so i don t like being treated as an inconvenience but can accept it as a peculiar charm but surly staff who are also incapable of arranging simple tasks without being asked multiple times that stops being charming and starts being annoying very quickly oh and i love the fact that the rooms come with a turntable but the choice of vinyl to play is poor think a bad charity shop in
