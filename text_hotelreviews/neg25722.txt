there were three of us staying in the room two king size beds and only two towels were provided also the shampoo conditioner body wash bottles provided didn t work properly which was really frustrating i don t think that the hotel was worth the money we paid it was very expensive for just one night and it was an average room the room service prices were also a bit steep a brown paper file for a pot noodle for painkillers for maybe i am just not used to gentrified london prices but i felt very ripped off i probably wouldn t stay here again unfortunately
