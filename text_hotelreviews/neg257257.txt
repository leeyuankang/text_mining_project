we stayed at different hotels across france during our recent trip starting from description of location which was falsely claimed as meters it was all lie hotel is atleast kms away from gare du nord the rooms were so small that it was claustrophobic the toilet was in closet absolutely no place to walk or keep luggage services were pathetic on reaching the hotel late in the night there was no pillow and blanket on requesting we were told that hotel doesn t have one heating was not working in the night we had sleep in cold we came back from cold and filled ourselves a cup of tea it wasn t brewed or anything just normal tea coffee facility provided by hotel in every room warm water tea sachet and creamer later on we were charged euros i have stayed in best western chain of hotels before it was my worst stay and makes me wonder if any one should stay in best western properties again my recommendation is that no one should ever stay here
