the lobby is more like a communal work hub night club loud music crowded and usually nowhere available to quietly entertain yourself or visitors the room is jammed with too much furniture not enough shelving for clothing you don t hang and a bathroom with no exhaust fan having to squeeze through queues at the front door getting into night club beneath the hotel just to access the lobby not for me perhaps great for hipsters but not old hippies like us
