my suite was stunning once upon a time the furniture was showing its age with nicks scrapes frayed upholstery and scratches a table was on a tilt due to a cracked leg the jacuzzi i could not get to work it was truly old world lux style but it had seen better days an update would be nice but i was still quite comfortable due to the first rate amenities my biggest dislike was the dirty stained carpet it really needed a good deep cleaning
