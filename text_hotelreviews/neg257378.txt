i read other reviews and they all said the same thing this is not a hotel i decided to judge for myself after a weekend stay i agree the welcome wasn t nor was the overall service there were staff members on the desk and that s all we saw they were polite which was nice but for over a night i was expecting more we were shown to our rooms but no help with luggage etc we got to our room which was very clean and impressive something that we weren t told beforehand nor upon arrival is that there is scaffolding up around the hotel exterior for the duration of our stay this was a bit annoying as the view is something that made me book this hotel there were no tea or coffee facilities either if this was advertised as a hotel at a price i d be over the moon it was however a hotel at a price i don t really write reviews but i felt this may be of some use to future guests if you re looking for a hotel at a price go with the big names that s what i think i ll do but hey it s only my opinion
