this was a star hotel probably years ago and has not been updated since in my opinion it needs to lose one of it s stars or update the king size bed was single beds pushed together the carpets were worn and in desperate need of replacing they provided shampoo but no conditioner and the hairdryer blew out cold air we left our room in to explore paris in the afternoon on the second day we stayed i asked reception to organise the turning over of our room and additionally left out the door handle sign requesting so but it wasn t turned over when we returned later that night overall very dissatisfied
