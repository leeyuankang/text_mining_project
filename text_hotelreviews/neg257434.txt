i had specifically asked for a quiet room the room i was in had a laminate wood floor and i suspect others next to and around it also did whilst overall it was quiet suddenly i d be woken up by others moving they probably weren t making a huge amount of noise but because of the laminate flooring the sound really carried in addition to that the bed has a wooden frame around it and creaks every time you move loudly enough to wake you up i had chosen to stay in london as i had a social engagement in town that night and thought i would be better rested the next day if i didn t commute home after it and back in to london early the next day i all honesty it was probably the worst night s sleep i ve ever had added to that the fire alarm went off just after a false alarm but the man working had no idea what to do really disappointed as i ve stayed here before and had a good stay
