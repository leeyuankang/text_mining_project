breakfast was amazing although it would be nice to see the same kind of variety in food with the rest of the menu the rooms were really comforting however i thought a double twin bedroom would be two separate beds however it was only two separate mattresses still pushed together on one bed which was a bit disappointing so i would reccomend having some bedding options other than that the room was amazing
