dear madam sir i am a world traveller i always book from you and i have stayed at pretty good hotels looking at the pictures you have displayed on booking com and i travel twice to london yearly i paid nearly for this hotel for days this is not a little amount i have stayed at other hotels in london and for this price i have stayed in very good hotels like millenium hotel knightsbridge but i was shocked when i checked into sydney house chelsea the staff were very nice so this is not about the staff but these are my complaints first of all the reception does not look like a reception its like a class dormitory reception everything looked used not old old is nice old is antique lift rooms breakfast room all clastrophobic i know london town hotels have rooms as big as but this is not what the picture looked like housekeeping forgot to clean my room day and the other days they cleaned it although i didnt stay much nights in my room i found hair on my pillows they didnt change the sheets daily walls have like pen marks on them in the room and all the material looks dirty and old breakfast room at the basement tables were all dirty i took pictures of it if you want it i can send you when i asked for cream to drink with my coffee the cream i got was rotten yes rotten so i gave it back to the kitchen and said throw it away otherwise if a customer of yours gets poisoned you will be sued so its not the kitchens fault but whoever the manager is running this business this hotel i have to congratulate the hotel for such a bad management definately not value for money thank you senem
