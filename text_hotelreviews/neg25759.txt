arrival at reception young man in charge was standoffish and dismissive no nice greeting deputy was rude on asking why i needed photo id for myself and partner in room was told wouldn t you like to know who was staying at your house in a superior tone then told it was for security i was not informed this was needed when booking on arriving back later that night there was no security we were not asked who we were when going through lobby from the bar into the lift the lift did not require the room card to activate the lift as in other hotels so infact anyone could have come to the room unfortunately the first experience with the staff at arrival made the ace hotel a negative experience great hotel needs friendlier staff with less attitude more humour and more customer experience
