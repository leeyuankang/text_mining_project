we had two dinners but unfortunately we were ushered in both occasions in the bar area only we would have liked to be in the main dining hall also the previous guests must have brought in food and place it in the fridge the fridge has a terrible odor when opened i complained about it and someone must have done something although the odor was lessened it still bothered my wife and me
