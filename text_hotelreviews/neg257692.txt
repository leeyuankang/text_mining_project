the room smelt of cigarette smoke when we arrived and was on the small side also there was nowhere to sit and do hair make up etc the mirror at the desk was too high to sit at too low to stand at in the end i used the mirrored wardrobe door however this didn t provide anywhere to put makeup etc except on the bed not great with white covers
