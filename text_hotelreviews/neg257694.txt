there was a very loud party in the hotel the music kept us awake until this completely impacted on our enjoyment the following day as we were extremely tired we had booked this break to celebrate our birthdays and had been looking forward to our trip for some time we were not told about the party at the time of the booking and was told by the manager it was an impromptu party we were compensated which was very kind but i would rather have had a good nights sleep and been able to enjoy the following day
