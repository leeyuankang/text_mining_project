because we travelled with a theatre trip we were not allowed to sit in the main restaurant they had long tables seating about each they were covered in empty dishes dirty plates stale food not one waitress came near the tables the whole time we were there and we had to clear a space and get our own cutlery the tea was in an earn and was cold and grey the food was cold too i have never stayed in a hotel as bad as this before for breakfast
