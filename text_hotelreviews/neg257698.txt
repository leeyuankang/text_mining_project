my wife arrived an hour earlier but could not check in as the receptionist insisted to debit her card for the complete stay in advance she refused as i was to pay the hotel and she only had card which would then be blocked for the entire trip she had to sit unattended at the bar for hours until i arrived i ask myself if the reception could not have been a bit flexible knowing that i am on the way and i had anyway my card details on the booking com as security
