on arrival we had booked rooms only were allocated to us the receptionist then found another room for our friends and to their horror on entering the room they found other guests already in the room the breakfast room is far too small for the number of guests most tables could only be accessed from one side which did not lend to a relaxed meal a lot of moving about to gain a seat
