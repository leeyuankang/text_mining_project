very difficult to arrange parking on arrival i left my husband in the car while i ran in to ask for the valet parking as promised on the phone the receptionist said he would be several minutes as he was doing another job she told me to phone my husband to tell him to park at the side of the hotel there were no places to park both my husband and myself spent the first minutes of our trip waiting on the pavement next to our car to prevent it receiving a parking ticket etc until he arrived to park it for us on checkout it took receptionists to work the computer in order to pay for our overnight parking we were at reception for almost half an hour we then had to wait a further minutes for our car to be brought to the hotel it ended up literally being parked in the middle of the road while myself and my husband scrambled in trying not to get knocked over i understand that parking is an issue but the whole organisation of this was not acceptable even though the staff were trying so hard to remedy the problems
