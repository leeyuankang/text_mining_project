initial room had a drill like noise coming from air con system upgraded to executive room which was lovely when booking with booking com we ticked the breakfast included filter which threw up this hotel but then found out we had to pay an extra for our breakfast which was annoying booing com should make this clearer but on the whole the hotel was lovely was there the night of the london bridge attack but felt safe in hotel
