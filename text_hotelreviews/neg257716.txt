the service was a little lacking at breakfast and we had to find our own way around the place no one took our order or asked if we wanted tea or coffee at breakfast that may be due to some of the staff s english skills but still it could have been better as other guests were being served properly the beds were lumpy and hard and the shower was very weak not what i expected from an expensive hotel
