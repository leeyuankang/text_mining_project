i think the hotel is a little confused is it a nightclub or hotel at our room was so noisy we called to enquire what the noise was sounded like hoovering above us and to see if anything could be done about it and had to shout to be heard by the receptionist over the phone eventually the hoovering stopped when my partner went outside in the early evening the following day he was refused re entry and told not tonight until he managed to convince him he was staying at the hotel i have emailed to let the hotel know that these things bothered us during our stay though i haven t yet heard anything back the beds are very soft this could be a good thing or a bad thing
