we had requested a room with twin beds and had received an email confirmation stating that would be possible upon check in they did not have that room available for the first night so we had a double bed which was very small the second night we were upgraded to a bigger room for the remainder of our trip which was lovely we also had a not so good experience with the driver that the hotel scheduled for our pick up from heathrow but upon arriving at the hotel the charges were taken off of our bill
