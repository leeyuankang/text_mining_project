we use radisson on a regular basis and this is the worst and smallest room we have ever experienced the aircon worked on a sine curve it was either freezing or unbearably hot in the room the bed creaked continuously with any slight movement like a mast sailing ship in a hurricane i didn t sleep for nights the bathroom looked trendy but was totally impractical i have limited bend in my left leg and access to the in bath shower was very hazardous because you enter at the slope end of the bath and there is no grab bar to steady yourself the grab bar is at the other end of the bath which is neither help nor ornament there is also only a fixed overhead shower which i think are a waste of time because you can t wash or rinse your private bits overall a very trendy looking room but essentially a very annoying experience
