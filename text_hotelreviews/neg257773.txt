only couple of things that could be improved the breakfast was adequate only one choice of egg which was scrambled and the beans where bbq there was a menu that you could order from but i cant see why fried eggs couldn t be on the buffet the hotel was very busy and quite cramped with tables also no plates for your toast we asked waiter for another plate he asked what it was for so think that could be a tip to put some plates by where toaster is
