we booked for one night bed and breakfast as my husband had appointment at uchl mcmillan cancer centre we had to stay an extra day so receptionist booked us in and gave discount turns out she took the breakfast off as the discount and caused us embarrassment of going down for breakfast and being refused we were told we had been upgraded we didnt ask for an upgrade we asked for bed and breakfast so to refuse breakfast when we were over to see a cancer specialist as my husband is very ill was absolutely pathetic we are back to london in weeks time for another week stay and we will definitely not be staying at this hotel again reeption staff would need a bit of training
