breakfast was a real disappointment not the food but the management of the breakfast service the breakfast plates were cold and wet so the scrambled egg etc was cold v quickly they ran out of bread for toast and staff were rude and just said they had been busy when asked for butter etc we had to ask at least times for most things a very disappointing end to trip to london and really let hotel down they need someone in charge in charge
