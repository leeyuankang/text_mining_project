i booked this hotel for my daughter and myself as we had tickets for harry potter and the cursed child at the palace theatre and it was only a short walk away we arrived early as previously advised to discover there were no available rooms despite the hotel booking app advising otherwise i was informed we would be upgraded from a standard room to a king delux and this room would be available to us when we returned in the evening the upgraded room we were allocated was less than i would expect from a standard room but would have sufficed if there had not been a horrible dampish smell made worse by a raging hot radiator when i asked to change rooms i was advised the hotel was at occupancy after informing the night manager of my disappointment we were given an upgrade which was lovely however i felt more of a nuisance than a valued customer the room including breakfast had been paid in full months prior to our stay upon checkout i discovered a further had been added to the invoice for items from the mini bar which had not been used i was later advised this was a mistake and the full they had deducted for incidentals from my card upon arrival would be refunded in full all in all a disappointing stay and the first time since using booking com that a hotel has given the impression my business was not what they really desired to that end they will not be receiving it again
