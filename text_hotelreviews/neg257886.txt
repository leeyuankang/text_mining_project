we asked for our bags to be taken to the rooms when they were ready which was agreed this didn t happen but when we went to collect them the concierge couldn t do enough for us and sent the remaining bags up to the rooms there then breakfast was ok great selection but everything running low and it took quite a while to replace when asked if we would like teas coffee this was brought to us in dribs and drabs was very hard to attract the attention of a waitress to ask for more of anything as they were so busy and only on duty
