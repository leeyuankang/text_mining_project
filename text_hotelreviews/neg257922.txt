the reason we chose this hotel was because it had an option of twin beds as we were two friends travelling together for wimbledon men s final despite trying to ascertain twin beds through booking com twice before our visit twin beds were not available the hotel eventually upgraded us and gave us a z bed very lumpy they told us it s better to book direct not with booking com
