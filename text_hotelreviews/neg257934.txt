i phoned the day before to confirm my request for a twin room assured by the call handler at the hotel we had been allocated a twin room on arrival none available this was extremely upsetting travelling with a same sex friend who didnt really want to share in london on a birthday treat for her we were given single duvets we asked for more milk for the tea in the room as only enough for one cup each it never arrived we purchased a pint locally where are the biscuits
