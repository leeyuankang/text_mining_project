my friend s son and partner tried to arrange a bottle of prosecco for the room as it was my friend s birthday however the staff on the radisson central number were not very helpful and it took them most of the day to try and get this sorted when it eventually arrived at our room it was delivered with a smile also the breakfast wasn t great and service poor
