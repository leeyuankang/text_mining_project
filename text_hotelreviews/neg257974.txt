the pillows are so thick they are practically useless and they are not even soft pillows there were pillows for what finally reception sent me a small one which i used the temperature setting was hard to figure out i turn down to c from but it does not stay there it comes back to c i requested for a nicer higher floor room i got a room facing the back unsightly roof of some building to be fair the reception lady was willing to switch but i did not want to change to another room just for one night the staff is very helpful and courteous i thank them overall i felt i should have stayed at hampton inn cheaper and includes breakfast
