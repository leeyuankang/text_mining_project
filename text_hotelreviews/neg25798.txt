i think it would be good if guests at the hotel were able to enter the club in the building on a guestlist our breakfast in bed would have been delicious if it had been warm enough unfortunately it was cold by the time it arrived we enjoyed our room but were a little disappointed that we have no view it made the living space seem really quite dark as we faced onto the building opposite
