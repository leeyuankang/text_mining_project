good afternoon we have just returned from a stay at your hotel last night i have to say i m somewhat shocked and disappointed at the service we received whilst staying with you firstly a member of your staff knocked and then proceeded to come straight into our room yesterday afternoon they quickly left shouting sorry once they realised we were there we thought this to be somewhat odd but quickly dismissed it as an obvious mistake this morning the same thing happened again this was a different member of staff and presumingly they were waiting to potentially clean our room on check out but even so i feel it s unacceptable and inappropriate to knock once and then use their own key to enter uninvited in all the years of hotel breaks i have never experienced something like this let alone it happening twice on check out this morning we explained the situation to nelson who simply said sorry about that it can happen sometimes i didn t feel this was an acceptable apology it sounds like it s a common occurrence at your hotel maybe it s a policy that needs revisiting finally there was a discrepancy with our final bill when i politely questioned this with stephanie she came across extremely rude and condescending the bill was in fact correct but a simple explanation with less attitude would have been greatly appreciated she made us feel very uneasy and it was very unnecessary and disappointing from a hotel of your caliber we paid for our room last night our experience with you did not justify the price we paid and we feel very disappointed with our stay i have felt the need to add this post as our concerns fell on deaf ears at check out this morning i hope you will address these issues so that other guests are not in the same situation kind regards
