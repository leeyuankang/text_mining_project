we requested an extra duvet and the new cover had eye makeup on it we requested a twin room in september for a january visit and was told the room type was subject to availability that should surely have been enough notice we had to pay for the upgrade to a bigger bed rather than have a double we were offered a king room that looked like a double staff said the room was bigger than a twin room which was also a joke
