a few things that spoilt our stay firstly the constant alarm that you could hear from our room we were on the floor and i appreciate the alarm was coming from else where but it was difficult to sleep secondly after a night out at the theatre we returned to the hotel with the intention to order room service after we missed our dinner resivation earlier in the evening due to traffic we called the number stated in the information book and to our surprise we were abruptly told the kitchen was closed and we needed to ring back in minutes and order from the after midnight menu so we selected from the after midnight menu which is a bit more expensive but felt this was fair given the hour and the impressiveness of the late night menu sadly the person that answered our second call was as unhelpful as the first told me several times the kitchen was closed i said i understood but was it still ok to order a sandwich i gave my order to be told it was unlikely as they could only use what was left in the kitchen why have an extensive evening menu for room service if the only thing they could offer me was a cheese and tomatoe sandwich but both being diabetic we needed to eat so agreed to the sandwich but it just got worse or so minutes later a knock at the door before i was even off the chair to answer the door the in room phone was ringing which woke my mother i opened the door to find a very grumpy man rolling his eyes at me and thrusting the phone back in his pocket and literally shoving the plate at me he then asked me to sign the receipt which he placed on top of the covered sandwich which i was holding he appeared very impatient with me when i asked him to hold the sandwich while i signed it seems silly i m sure but it was quite upsetting to e met with this attitude considering the cost of the room i ve honestly had nicer service in a travel lodge the most disappointing part of this whole story was the sandwich itself
