we booked a superior twin room but were given a standard double fifth floor the view pretty awful when we complained we were told that it was because we booked via booking com they keep their twin rooms only for guests booking directly we were then moved to a king size double floor a nice one however we were asked to move out after two nights as there happened to be a party right under our room and we were promised a business room as a compensation but in the end we ended up in another king size double floor very nice but extremely noisy we were too tired to complain again as it was just for one night at check in i gave the name of my company to the receptionist and i made sure she got the name right on the invoice at check out however was a completely different name unknown to me only the address was right messy the staff at the reception has no idea which room is which and where it is located i would suggest providing the receptionists with some floor plans it would also be useful for the guests at check in to know where their room actually is
