we booked this hotel as it very clearly said that single beds were an option for the deal we paid for when we got there the staff advised that not to be the case and we had to pay an exorbitant amount to have a rollaway put in the room i would not ever recommend this hotel because of what i consider was misleading advertising i will never consider a radisson again because of my experience
