right after checking in we went to our room and there was pee in the toilet and foot stamps on the bathroom floor i thought the manager would react stronger but all he did was to send someone to clean the bathroom and change our room the next day no discount no one free night nothing one day we came to our room to find a dirty rag sitting on the chair again no strong reaction from the staff after reporting it to the manager he sent the housekeeper to pick it up the bed was stiff the bedsheets kept on pulling out of the bed while sleeping and the duvet covers as well which i found disgusting my key kept on stopping the whole stay i had to replace it every other day if not twice a day it was really painful to go up to my room and to find out that the key does no longer work then to go all the way to the reception to get it replaced the towels were a bit rough
