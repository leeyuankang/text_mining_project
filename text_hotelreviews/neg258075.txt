the staff in the restaurant breakfast had serious morale issues they were not friendly looked as though they really didn t want to be bothered or be there i really didn t want to ask them for anything and so took butter cutlery off other tables so i wouldn t have to bother them our group also witnessed two separate altercations between hotel guests and the restaurant staff once at night and once in the morning the restaurant staff really let the hotel down and were not a true reflection of the rest of the hotel this was not at all what i expected whilst entertaining two friends who are new to london the reception staff were excellent
