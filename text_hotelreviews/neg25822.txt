we asked at reception if they could direct us to the nearest starbucks and were asked why we weren t trying the amazing coffee in the hotel i understand the need for staff to sell their own coffee but if a guest wants starbucks direct them to starbucks incidentally we tried the hotel coffee the following day and it was cold also some of our party ordered room service and it was also cold they were disappointed in room service completely as they intended to share their order so when ordering a side of sausages they didn t realise that this meant sausage quite difficult to share sauasage between people
