the only complaint i have is the restaurant even though we communicate well in french when it comes to dining our reading of french isn t the best if they could at least have one or two english menu s so we can better understand what we re ordering our waiter was the only one during our visit in france whom we encountered who gave a poor and arrogant description of the menu given the price of the menu items we wanted to know for sure we ordering accordingly in this case i consider his young age the others in the restaurant were very friendly
