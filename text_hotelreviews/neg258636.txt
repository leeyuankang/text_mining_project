the single room was very small even by london standards there was hardly any natural light as the room had only one small window the decor of the room was dingy and unremarkable and was not consistent with the bright and modern bathroom the air con and fridge made a bit of noise so it was quite disruptive having the bed so close to them the room was literally one step from the elevator and the bed was one step into the room any noise in the corridor and from the elevator can be heard clearly
