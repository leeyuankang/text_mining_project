there was no breakfast ok it didn t actually state that there was breakfast but if this is not available then you should say so please we requested some special food for breakfast and didn t even get a reply to state that breakfast was not available also when we checked in the guy forgot to tell us that there was no breakfast the room was smaller than it looked on the website and too hot and difficult to adjust the temperature the shower screen was way too small to offer protection from wetting most of the floor the towels were hard and like sandpaper lastly the bed was very hard and offered only one bed side table
