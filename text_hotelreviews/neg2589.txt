i ll start off with the location was good for what we needed but it was freezing cold in the room all night i had to call to ask for extra blankets at felt like i was camping outside had to call twice and wait to get an extra blanket the room was an ok size but didn t expect our seperate beds to be together there was one plug outlet for the room as well which was frustrating the throw blanket on the bed was torn and stained as well so that wasn t very nice noise coming from upstairs and next door we only needed it for the night so i guess it did what i needed to do but i probably wouldn t stay there again
