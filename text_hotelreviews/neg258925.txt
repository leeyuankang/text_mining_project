i don t usually report bad hotel experiences but this i feel i need to please note i m french speaking and a local corporate traveler coming to paris for recurrent business i post in english to the benefit of the many tourists often non europeans who deserve to experience this amazing city in the best possible conditions i stayed four nights with my partner in this hotel this end july i chose it because it was a recommended booking offer a website i use most of the time for my hotel bookings anywhere the ibis styles was identified as a four star hotel the price was indeed a bargain breakfast included as corporate traveler thus i took the opportunity to test the ibis standard considering the convenience of a chain instead of independent hotels to favor better locations according to work duties the facts the room the bed in particular was smaller than presented in the ad well i certainly have misread it happens a lot my mistake it is not very comfortable though for an expected four star standard the amenities and facilities were incredibly poor no coffee machine to have a coffee you need to go downstairs and bring up a carton cup no toiletries cheap towels no wardrobe of course no pool no fitness no restaurant isn t it a must in a four star anyway we can survive the telephone in the room didn t work and was not even explained too bad the wifi was very poor i complained and received the classical parisian answer we are currently changing provider it s temporary i heard it at least in ten hotels don t believe it i work in an office which deals with heavy up and down load the provider has been changed in a couple of days and is far sufficient for fifty of people at once be sure to bring your data sharing phone with you although i need to say is also poor in this area thus try to avoid watching movies or series we were on the fourth floor and the elevator suddenly broke down
