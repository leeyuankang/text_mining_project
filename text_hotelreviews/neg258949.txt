the bedroom was quite small but there are different lounge areas which make up for it the bathroom set up does not give you much privacy it all depends on how prude you are the exterior was being renovated not an issue at the weekend i am a light sleeper and could hear the metro rumbling underneath in the early morning not to mention guests in neighboring rooms
