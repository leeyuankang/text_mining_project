the hotel is in an excellent location central to shopping museums and eating the hotel is fairly basic certainly no frills to be had at this establishment i m not sure it deserves a four star rating certainly a solid three would be more appropriate the rooms are clean an a reasonable size the breakfast passes with a push the bathroom accessories are on the cheapish side there are probably much better deals to be had so shop around and get a better bang for your buck
