our room was comfortable extremely quiet large enough and beautifully designed and executed the bed was excellent and the shower also excellent what was a deficit was the location of the room in a wing on the street floor with no view except for the dining area of the hotel used mainly for the bar and serving breakfast next visit i will for sure ask for a room at least on a floor above the ground level
