the price was a bit higher than i would have liked although star i would have only have paid about per night for location etc breakfast to be served later than maybe until although isn t early when your away from home you want a bit of a lye in check out to be at rather than as i found this a bit early compared to other hotels the shower was great and functional however i wasn t a fan of how it had two lines of water coming out the lack of shower curtain meant the bathroom got very wet there was also a door stopper under the toilet to stop the door hitting it this was in a bad location as a couple of times i hit my toes on it and as it was metal was rather painful i think from seeing the one behind the main door it was missing the rubber cover so this needed replacement and it had accumulated some dirt inside wasn t isn t very nice
