the hotel staff wasn t attentive enough we waited nearly one hour just to get into our room one of the huge problem is housekeeper didn t clean room properly somehow they didn t even refill the towel or anything room dining has small amount of options first of all by the time you call them to order the staff will tell you that they pretty much run out of everything
