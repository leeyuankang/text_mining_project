the room itself wasn t very inviting it was basically a grey concrete box with an overhead fluorescent light i definitely walked in and kind went ugh it was also very small the cooling worked but i didn t sleep well as the temperature varied between too hot no cooling and too cold minimal cooling i think the bathroom was fine clean well laid out and not too tiny the shower was nice with one minor flaw it had a shower head you could hold but not mount high enough for your head and the currently fashionable but not enjoyable imo ceiling mounted wide drip head which i find both wastes water and doesn t have much volume for what does hit you overall it was all okay but i ve stayed in more pleasant hotels in the area for less money
