in this day age the fridge should be a standard however it was not as apparently only available in club rooms no slippers or bathrobes either though they did provide the former on request after a little coercion lat time i had booked a club room but it didn t have a proper shower area hence i chose the deluxe double this time by checking the bathroom pics beforehand however strangely this had some other items missing like the fridge bathrobes i just don t get it how does it all balance out
