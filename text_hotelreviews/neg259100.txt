they call themselves boutique hotel but this is just a very small hotel in my understanding a boutique hotel is where every room is carefully designed and each room has a complete different concept in this hotel all rooms are the same but have different sizes our room was tiny and we were welcomed by immediately being asked whether we wanted an upgrade for a bigger room although we thought we had already paid quite a lot to stay in this hotel it doesn t really feel like it s a star hotel it feels like a very expensive small hotel in the center of the city massively overrated but decent and comfortable
