extremely small rooms and very bad front desk service on the day we did not get a fresh supply of toiletries the same dirty bath sheet from the previous day was folded and put back on the bathroom towel shelf we called for some one to assist with opening the safe that was never resolved we eventually after over an hour wait resolved the problem ourselves there was no room service menu and it took forever and a visit to the front desk to get one brought to our room from the front desk we called to inquire about transport to the airport after close to an hour we had to call again the food from room service was terrible over priced and certainly not value for money probably the worst vegetable soup we have ever had no cnn
