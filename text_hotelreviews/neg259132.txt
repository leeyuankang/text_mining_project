the gym is very clean but extremely small one treadmill one ellipstical one bike however i really like that there s a precor functional training gym fts glide i believe the location is rather quiet in the evening this is either good or bad for me good but i can imagine others who want to be on a street with a lot of bars if so this is not for you
