room was very small not like the pictures it is not a star hotel by a long stretch definitely an average star hot chocolate from room service was and it was just a tiny cup of powdered hot chocolate this is very disappointing especially in france as they usually do hot chocolate so well the maids knocked on our door at every day asking if they could clean the room very strange time to ask to clean your room i was almost overcharged on checkin and i show the girl my booking com document to show her the price she assured me that was ok and i wouldnt be charged more than booking com had told me then on check out they tried to charge me another different amount overall quite disappointed with the hotel its not a star
