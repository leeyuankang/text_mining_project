the picture on booking com and the room we received were worlds apart the nice modern white d cor of the pictures displayed on the website was very deceiving when we arrived at our room which was right next to the lift we heard the lift all night the wall paper was peeling the d cor was at least years old and the room was very very tight to get around not to mention our toilet door and front door opened into each other which meant you step into the room and into the toilet the bathroom was not renovated like the ones in the website and we were very disappointed regarding the sewage smell to top it up my son and his girlfriend arrived a week later and had booked at the same time they received one of the renovated rooms on the other side of the courtyard they paid less and received the better room when booking with other websites we have been more satisfied this experience is the second time booking com has deceived us with their pictures a couple of years ago we had the same thing happen when we visited the greek islands unfortunately for booking com i will not be booking through you again although i have an existing booking with you for this year which i am yet to experience
