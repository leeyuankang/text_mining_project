we were not informed until we arrived that hotel was undergoing renovation it was quite a shock on arrival to find the reception area and stairs covered in dust sheets workmen and tools lift was not working so we had to be relocated from more spacious quiet rooms on top floor with balcony to standard rooms on the floor we were given per cent discount but considering we were in cheaper rooms anyway and suffered a lot of discomfort and disappointment i did not think this was very generous i have stayed in this hotel on a previous occasion and had been very satisfied but not this time
