this is not a star hotel in my opinion decor is worn out in places toilets in the main enterance for example where wood was exposed on the skirting breakfast although very nice was too pricy room small they call it boutique but really it is just small the room we had had an enterance hall which was good for storing buggy ect but given that it was a room for a family with a baby access was on the first floor via a lift then we had to go down a flight of stairs to get to the door to our room no bt sport in room or bar so unable to watch a big champions leaugue match surely a star hotel can afford to provide this for guests
