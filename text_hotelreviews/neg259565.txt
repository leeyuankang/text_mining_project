the people working at the reception are by far the slowest clerks i have come across nothing was digitalized and they made mistakes constantly we left for meetings twice and came late because of reception taking too long with customers one couple had to check out before us which we had to wait for minutes for and our check out took minutes it felt like fawlty towers and for this reason i cannot recommend the hotel if you don t like waiting for what seems to be no reason
