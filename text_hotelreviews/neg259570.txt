the room we were allocated was quite inadequate we had asked in advance for the same room as we had stayed in previously but despite the hotel being very quiet were told it was not available the room we were given was small at the back of the hotel with a shower toilet room only separated from the bedroom by a flimsy sliding door we do not believe that can be acceptable in a not inexpensive star hotel during our stay work commenced stripping the wooden floors throughout the ground floor including the breakfast room using a noisy smelly industrial size machine so that work continued around us without any explanation or apology we were very disappointed we will not stay at this hotel again
