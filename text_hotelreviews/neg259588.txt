good stay however small things like one host at the hotel could be more flexible especially when the client asks for things that are reasonable i e checking total bill one day before departure and small things like this did not like attitude clients do rule sir especially when they ask things nicely and politely cleaning lady has to put everyday shower gel etc as these were missing or ad hoc u also need to get out of your room by noon everyday in order for yr room to be done as otherwise cleaning lady is not there afternoons not a pbm if u know this beforehand very very small lift that does the job though but overweight people with luggage not sure but this goes with how old the building is part of the charm attention is needed to repaint bottom doors and skirtings to keep the look being great aside from above good stay love the look of certain rooms breakfasts in the room were very nice you can ask what you wish very romantic and the rest of the staff was helpful would return
