we were on the very top floor when we got into the hotel room it was uncomfortable hot we had to phone down late at night and ask them to turn it down as we couldn t sleep had both windows wide open and the air con on the matress was uncomfortable it was rock solid we didn t get a full night sleep as we were too hot and very uncomfortable the second night in we were up watching tv and the electrics blew we had to phone down and get them to come and sort it which was very irritating afterwards the light over the shower did not work so overall not a good stay we would look elsewhere next time which is such a shame because it was such a lovely hotel and the staff were great
