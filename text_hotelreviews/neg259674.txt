fixed timing for room cleaning we were out the whole morning and came back after lunch to have a short nap however the room hasn t been cleaned were told that they were about to clean our room now or the cleaner would have to leave for the day in the end we opted not to have our room cleaned not a huge issue but could have used the time we were away to clean the room
