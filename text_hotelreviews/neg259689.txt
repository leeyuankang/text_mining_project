the hotel is friendly and well maintained at an excellent location however while it may be pleasant for young people we are senior citizens and we found the rooms very cramped wth almost no space to hang clothes or shelves also the rooms are rather claustrophobic so despite reserving for eight nights we moved on after one night to the holiday inn st germain also booked via booking com it met our expectations and even though we booked on the same day offered much better value for money
