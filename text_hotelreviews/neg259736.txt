my son had a flight scheduled a few hours ahead of us so we asked the receptionist on duty the night before he had to leave to schedule a small taxi because he was trying to save money on fare he said yes the morning my son had to leave a taxi van came to pick him up he had to pay euros more than we did for our van everything else was fine except for this the receptionist should have communicated this to my son since he arrived in the lobby minutes before the van arrived
