there was a problem with our first room which we weren t informed about wet carpet leaks in the bathroom etc we did stay there for one night and the next day staff moved all of our belongings to another room without us knowing having this said staff was very helpful and friendly understanding our concerns of our belongings the second room was much better the breakfast room is too small for the amount of guests in the hotel sometimes there is a qeue of people waiting to be seated other guests are not even eating anymore just reading newspapers or talking to each other but occupying a breakfast table i think staff should be able to say something about this especially when people are waiting there are other spaces to talk or read
