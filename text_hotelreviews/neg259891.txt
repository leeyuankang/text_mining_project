the staff seemed too lazy to do anything we were served out of date yoghurt for breakfast our room phone didn t work and had to wait for days for it to be fixed i had to get my own room service the shower flooded the gym and the housekeeper left our room door open all day when we told the receptionist he just said it happens on the last day the housekeeper didn t give us any milk for our tea so we rang down asking for some they said it would be with us shortly it never came and we checked out never having one such a disappointment when the hotel its self is nice
