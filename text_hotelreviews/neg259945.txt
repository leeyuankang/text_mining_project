hotel needs some serious upgrades including enhanced air conditioning as ours set at the only temp cool was a whisper from the photos the rooms look quite boutique with the dark neutral palette and bleached wood finish clearly this was a relatively recent visual upgrade effort other aspects of the room and overall shortage of staff let the room and experience down the building and location is promising but truly needs more staff for example there was a single mattress propped vertically outside my room the entire days of my stay by the service elevator in room dining trays from night prior seen when leaving hotel for evening were still there by am the next morning and were then stacked by said service elevator for me to navigate getting my luggage around upon departure room must of been the lowest class available with a view to the ac shaft and walls steep stair case to room and down again to bathroom shoddy caulk repairs to the ageig marble bathroom looked really badly done i am used to more of a luxury hotel experience so was very off put i thought i was getting a last minute bargain but truly got what i paid for
