payed for nights in a junior suite and thought i was getting a bargain i would rather have stayed in a travel lodge it wasn t value for money at all promised a drink on entry which wasn t offered it was degrees outside and the in room air conditioning was broken so the room was like a sauna shower had no pressure at all to it and barely washed the shampoo out of my hair and the hot water would cut out mid way though your shower as well when we reported the problems we just got told the duty manager would be informed when they came in but nothing ever happened
