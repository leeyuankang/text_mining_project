room was very dirty with only obvious areas being cleaned beds very uncomfortable bathroom was hideous with broken tiles everywhere that had unprofessional attempts to fix toilet seat and taps very loose no hot and cold markings on basin taps which could pose a hazard to young children i wouldn t put a room with these issues into service
