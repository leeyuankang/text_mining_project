this is the time in staying here over the past hence nothing has changed i feel it has been left behind there are many issues to address such as noise heating to hot in some rooms or to cold in others loose tiles in bathrooms broken toilet seats creaky floor boards windows don t close properly we moved rooms nights out of the this is a shame as it is a lovely hotel i just hope they start addressing these problems
