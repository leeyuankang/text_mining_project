room was cold because the only heating was an inadequate electric oil heater and the room air conditioning didn t give out much in the way of warm air the plumbing is weird no cold water for at least a couple of minutes after running the cold tap for this long the water gets hotter then finally cools down this doesn t seem hygienic and isn t environmentally friendly no breakfast on the last day but we weren t informed that the chef hadn t arrived until after we d gone through the rigmarole of first being turned away to get a voucher from reception then sitting waiting ages for just a coffee this didn t leave us enough time to try an alternative venue around the corner only when complaining at reception were we told why there was such poor service but it was already too late
