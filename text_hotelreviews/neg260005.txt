we were disturbed by cleaning staff no less than times on one day walking in without knocking first this felt very uncomfortable as we were not dressed and one of us got woken up sleeping in the afternoon from jet lag and the next day when we did want them to clean the room not only did we leave a sign to clean up but we also told the staff at the front desk that room was ready for maid service when we came back or hours later it was not done then the staff insisted that the sign said do not disturb and an argument ensued when we returned to the room the sign read very clearly please clean room the sides of the sign should be vastly different colours and design as they are easy to misread the shower temperature was so unstable that i got burnt several times as it kept readjusting
