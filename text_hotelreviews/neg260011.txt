once checked in and up in the room we did understand why other people have mentioned how the rooms seem tired they are but for us it didn t take away from the experience and my friend described it as shabby chic aside from that we really don t have any complaints about our stay although the cleaners could probably do with paying a little more attention to cleaning on top of things like mirrors and doorframes something we probably wouldn t have noticed if it hadn t been for the fact we watched ramsey s hotel hell during our stay
