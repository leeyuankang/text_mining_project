on arrival they had no confirmation of booking we then had to re book and was put in room which is great if you love the drone of the air conditioning main vent going all night long we was given a complimentary breakfast which was a nice gesture but i m glad as would not have paid for it as the eggs solid beans dry and bacon not cooked
