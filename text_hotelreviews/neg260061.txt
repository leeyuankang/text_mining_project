facility was going through a renovation which was not announced during the time of booking otherwise i might have gone elsewhere the place was a bit noisy due to the renovation plumbing was old but functional the bathroom sink had separate hot and cold faucets made it difficult to wash your face without having to fill the sink some lights in the room did not work very limited room service menu
