usual problem of being a single traveller i was put in a poor room with a shower but no bath and one of the older rooms once i complained i was put in one of the newer rooms with a bath but why do you need to complain saving the better rooms for people that are not single travellers also i asked for an early morning call when i was leaving and i didn t get it they did remember to order my taxi though
