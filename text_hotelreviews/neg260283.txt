the room and bed were extremely small for us we are a family of adults and a year old baby and couldn t all fit on the queen size bed as for our baby stroller we couldn t fit it in the room even when it was folded and had to leave it outside the room at all times the breakfast was a continental breakfast and not an american style breakfast thus the varities were very limited to pastries cornflakes and some cheese
