i recieved a twin bed in my room although booked a queen bed room when i checked in late at night they started to say that they are not obliged to provide queen bed and only after they rechecked the booking they admitted that there was a mistake they could not have upgrade since the hotel was fully booked according to them i guess that that just sold my room twice thinking there will be a no show this is not appropriate for a holiday inn hotel
