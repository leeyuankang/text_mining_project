we had to leave early and had paid for breakfast in advance so they wanted to charge for us to request a takeaway coffee and croissant this was extremely disappointing as they should have honoured this in good faith for nothing forfeiting a full breakfast already paid in return for a croissant and coffee takeaway at surely is no hardship and they win regardless so not even doing this for no charge let alone an additional charge this let the hotel down in my opinion and i m in the hotel industry
