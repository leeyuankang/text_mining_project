when we arrived in the hotel nobody greeted us after we got our room card nobody offered to help us with our bags instead we had to find a trolley ourselves the rooms are dated pink purple themed throughout very small requested in advance for a room in the upper levels with a better view received room on first floor without view instead tv was positioned diagonally to the bed had to turn to see anything very uncomfortable room was so small we hardly had room to walk around the bed even the ceilings are low the bathrooms were old with stains and dirty corners around bathtub glass sliding door for the bathroom which makes a loud noise and bangs when you close or open noise from bathroom transfers to bedroom not romantic at all the worst part the food do not include breakfast it is the worst breakfast i have ever had in any hotel we couldn t eat any of it and were stuck with it for days it looks like food but tastes like garbage fruits are from a can meat is deep fried extremely oily juice is sugar water pancakes are sickly sweet coffee is a nespresso machine without milk frother ie only espresso real lattes etc cost extra croissants are worse than the frozen variety you get in a supermarket and the worst part is every day you have exactly the same limited buffet world s cheapest smallest buffet much nicer to eat in a cafe in paris and less expensive overall wouldn t recommend staying there with the prices they are charging should be downgraded to star
