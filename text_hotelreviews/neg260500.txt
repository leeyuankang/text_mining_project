for us the main problems resulted out of disappointment and a misalignment with our expectations in general rooms are small as per paris standards but that was fine for us since we did not really spend too much time in the room toilettes are separated from the bathroom so inside the room the toilette and the bathroom are located in two different smaller rooms this was a problem because if you need to go to the toilette in the middle of the night there is no way you are not going to wake up your fellow traveller you need to close one door and open another and walk around in the room to do that there is an apple tv which i think might be available for use as a computer that was slightly noisy during the night like in sleep mode so not absolutely noisy but this was disturbing for us the receptionists were trying to be helpful and friendly they answer all questions and smile constantly but in our opinion some of that was forced and not always genuine and effective really we went down to the spa to see where it was and how it was and thought it was smaller than it seemed in the pictures we were told that there was a steam room but we saw only the turkish hammam maybe this is the steam room in the end we could not use the spa anyway since it was not open before am in the morning the halls on the floors where the rooms are are really dark and lights are automatic in the evening when you are walking to your room this can be a bit bothering and scary really when we went down to get coffee or breakfast there was no one available in the bar terrace area to ask for anything we ended up going out for our morning coffee which was a shame because the terrace seemed nice and we might have wanted to enjoy a cup of coffee in the terrace
