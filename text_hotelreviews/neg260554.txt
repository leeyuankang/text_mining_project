we were checked in and checked out by a rude obnoxious receptionist named said he did not help us with our luggage when there is a sign on the desk concierge i asked him politely for help and he rudely told me to do it ourselves at checkout he overcharged us for breakfast as i politely asked him to explain he pounded his hand on the counter fortunately a lady staff intervened and helped us and from what i can tell told him off the cleaning lady replaces our towels daily but doesn t clean it very well because i can still see hair and dust in the sink and floor
