we were booked in a cheap room that faces the road apparently these rooms normally sell for eur you d have to be mad to pay that money to get no sleep for whatever reasons the road outside the hotel becomes gridlocked from about midnight to and parisiens like nothing more than composing sonic masterpieces with their car horns i have never in all my life heard so much noise from traffic in a hotel room it is utterly impossible to sleep at night bizarrely the road is peaceful during the day so it is easy to check in and believe you are on to a winner don t be fooled when we asked if we could change due to the noise problems we were told we have no rooms in your category note the distinction it is clear the hotel had some rooms that would have allowed us to get some sleep but they refused to allocate them despite them being available hence my low rating for the staff finally the breakfast is about as bog standard as it comes you ll get better food around the corner for half the price
