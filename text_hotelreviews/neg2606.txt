i booked a double room but it turned out to be single beds pushed together we found it very uncomfortable also the beds had seperate single bed sheets on them so no effort was made to even make it appear like a double bed double sheets at least would have been a start breakfast instead of new unpealed potatoes chips would be better the sausages were undercooked and the beans were cheap i was really dissapointed when we returned back from breakfast we noticed that someone had came into our room and stolen a mars bar that was on the bedside cabinet it made it worse by the fact it was a double mars bar so someone had torn it open and taken half then just left the other half in the torn wrapper and left it on the table i reported this incident to the duty manager she said she would look into it i really do not expect this kind of thing to happen especially in a reputable place like this it s not the item itself that i m concerned about but it s rather the value of principle
