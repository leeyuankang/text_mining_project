the room that i booked turned out to be horrible and i insisted on a transfer after some haggling i agreed to pay ten british pounds more for a better room the bed in that room was awful i couldn t believe i was going to complain again but i did the alternative was to pay the one night room cost and move to a better hotel the staff graciously moved me to a better room and told me they even added a pilot option so i would be more comfortable
