the bathroom was falling apart the shower didn t work properly and was dirty the basin was loose and the taps for the basin were not attached correctly so when you try to turn them on or off the whole unit turned the room has very little sound proofing and therefore all the noise from the street kept me awake most of the night i definitely felt like i was staying in a cheap or less star hotel and definitly was not a per night room sorry doubletree but i felt a little ripped off and would have been better off staying in a travelidge or premier inn instead don t let guests stay in rooms that are in need of repair and sort the noise levels out in the rooms that are street facing and perhaps the rating would be better consider charging a more reasonable price for a standard room
