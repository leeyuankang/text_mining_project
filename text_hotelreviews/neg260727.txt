we booked for nights and were put in room on the first night i had booked a double room but this room was more like a single the air con unit made a noise with no cold air it had been degrees that day too we were moved the next night to a bigger room but it was on the second floor on the front so extremely noisy but the air con unit was better the staff were friendly and helpful but it would have been nice if they had offered us a discount or free breakfast for the inconvenience i have stayed here before so know how big a double room is i felt like we had been fobbed off with a smaller room as we didn t come back to the hotel until i had booked it months in advance as it was for my birthday i won t stay there again
