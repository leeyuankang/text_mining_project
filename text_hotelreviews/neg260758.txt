i know that hotels in london usually have small rooms but my room was more like a cabin on a small boat they compensated this with an extra small bed i am and the both my feet were hanging out of the bed the bed felt more like and extra bed it was very hard and my shoulders streched pretty much all across it one of the windows had a crack all across it and the slightest wind made it slam all night there was abolutely no pressure in the shower so soap and shampoo took forever to get off i mentioned this when checking out but not really any response was given i am sure that they have nice rooms aswell but considering such a price at a in general nice chain this was way under my expectations
