we booked a bedroom apartment with each having a double bed we received an apartment with double bed and single which i would class this as a family room for two adults and a child the lift was broken the whole time we were their this wasn t too much of a problem but walking to our room seemed forever we felt we were going down stairs up stairs down loads of corridors and eventually into a room at the far end of nowhere the room was dingy the back of the door looked like it had something spilt down it and it had never been wiped down the room was just not acceptable for the money paid
