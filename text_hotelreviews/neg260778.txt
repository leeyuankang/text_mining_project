our bedroom suite was boiling hot clearly there was an issue with the thermostat not safe to put two kids in i was shown an identical boiling hot room on the same floor and told that it was my imagination it was not habitable either we were eventually put into a smaller suite with a dirty toilet and stained sheets the management were prompt and polite housekeeping arrived to fix the problem but i was charged the whole full rate and the only compensation was when we checked out i was given the manager s card and ensured an upgrade next time no thanks
