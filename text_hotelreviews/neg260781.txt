there was a screaming baby across the corridor we couldn t sleep the hotel staff said no rooms available at all but when i spoke to another person when checking out they said the hotel was only full whilst i understand the baby crying was not the hotels fault it wasnt mine either we obviously booked a hotel to sleep was disappointed that no genuine effort was made to help the situation and the staff in general were not happy no smiles on their faces
