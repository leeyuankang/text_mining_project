no bell service room was as big the single bed the space is so tight that i had to walk sideways to get around i can hear the people in the hall as if they were inside the room my college dorm room was bigger i complained and was asked to pay more to get a normal sized room i checked out the next day with a complaint the staff told me that i should have complained to get the room changed and that is what they always do this hotel has a nice lobby but the rooms are more like a star motel for the same price you can stay at nicer star hotels in the area dont waste your money or time with this place just as a mention i was offered breakfast for my complaint and they said they will do more after i accepted the breakfast they told me that they can t do anything because i accepted the breakfast
