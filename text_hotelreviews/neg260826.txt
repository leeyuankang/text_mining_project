i was disappointed that there was no fridge or minibar in the room although there was a small bottle of water provided on arrival which was appreciated we upgraded our room but i was surprised at how small it was i wish i had just got the basic room and saved the money as it would probably have been the same size the shower was a bit unimpressive not really very powerful
