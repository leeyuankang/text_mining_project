the price was a bit over the top for the type of room we got which was a deluxe double but not really deluxe you are paying for the location more than anything also the afternoon tea was quite cheaply made for the price the cakes were just small sponges and not like advertise sandwiches were very small and scones were dry even with the butter and jam on my wife enjoyed it though so maybe i was just being a bit picky apart from that breakfast was fantastic and plenty of choice i love the table service in the bar area too that was a good touch overall fantastic place just go elsewhere for afternoon tea
