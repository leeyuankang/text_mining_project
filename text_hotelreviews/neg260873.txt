the room was very small as well as the bathroom which couldn t be compared to other five stars hotel and you couldn t leave the luggage at the hotel before your check in date where i had to carry all my large luggage to travel at scotland you wouldn t want to imagine how i took all the bags catching a train to the high land the woman staff wasn t seem to be nice when explaining this to us she didn t even smile we were staying for four nights three people but the extra bed was a sofa bed which was a bad quality spring bed that could hurt your back
