staff on my first time checking in was really friendly and i was fortunate to have a slightly larger room on the hilton hhonors floor and then i checked out to go out of town and came back days later and had a rather impolite receptionist at the desk checking me in came in early from brighton and wasn t aware of the late check out time and so we weren t allowed to go to our room and receptionist her name i remember was luiza was in no way apologetic about the situation but told me flat in the face that room is not available until such a complete contrast to the first time when i was greeted by a really polite and helpful receptionist by the name of cristina and of course i didn t realise check out time was and someone from reception actually came up to our room and knocked on the door and said check out time is thank goodness we were packed and ready to leave the room anyways but the receptionist could have perhaps called to our room and told us it would have been less intrusive perhaps
