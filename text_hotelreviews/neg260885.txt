the room i was given was awful nothing like the pictures online it was dirty with old tired fittings marks and scratches on almost every surface a shower screen that fell apart when i moved it i asked to change rooms the was marginally better with the exception of the curtains hanging off the rails no charger for my toothbrush a really poor experience with room service half my order didn t arrive and what did came without any cutlery for per night for a standard double the quality of the rooms service was appalling very disappointed for a hotel trading under the doubletree hilton name there s plenty of other places on the same road stay somewhere else
