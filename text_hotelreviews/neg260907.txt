after staying enjoyably and without complaint at your hotels last year in our u s tour we were extremely disappointed with this visit we were told at reception that we were honours guests and would get free wi fi as our reward it transpires everyone gets this the room was small and cramped and there was a large food like stain on the carpet you couldn t even renew the two tiny bottles of complementary water on the second night quite frankly it was less enjoyable than a travel lodge which at least is honest about its value
