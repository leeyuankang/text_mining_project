we ordered room service on the first evening of our stay and we were very disappointed with a total cost of we had a nice but like warm burger and hard very pale chips which were advertised as times cooked being a chef it was clear to see these had not been cooked once properly let alone times i had a very important social event on the saturday evening with colleagues the plan was to eat in the resturant in the hotel followed by afternoon tea on the sunday unfortunately after the room service we opted for an alternative venue i did speak to reception who refunded the service charge on the meal but never the less we expected a lot more from such a high profile hotel the breakfasts were outstanding and again the staff fantastic had it not been for the room service out stay would have been perfect thank you
