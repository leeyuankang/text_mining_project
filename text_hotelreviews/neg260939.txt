there was a problem throughout our stay with the hot water no type of refund or perhaps a dinner voucher was offered we stayed nights out of the four showers i got were ice cold there was a notification on our tv to run the water an extra ten mins but this only catered for one shower having a massive throat and chest infection at the time the cold showers only prolonged my recovery
