totally inaccessible room lack of knowledge of any requests you may have asked for next room offered was equally bad but more accessible because of shape filthy bedside table and lifts tiny very average breakfast certainly poor value for money especially with the room we were given in fact we cut our stay short as we were so disappointed with the whole scenario receptionist staff could hardly speak english which was very frustrating too damp patch on ceiling and could hear drips in the bedroom
