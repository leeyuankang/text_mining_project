i was very dissapointed with the room for the price i payed travelodge rooms are bigger just as comfortable with a bigger bed and they are cheaper if you get what you pay for im going to travelodge next time i stay in london overall feeling of being charged for night and nearly for breakfasts because they could and not because they are special even though they are a hilton hotel i will not stay in any hilton hotels again and i would not recommend them either
