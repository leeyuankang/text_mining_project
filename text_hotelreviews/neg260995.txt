an absolute disgrace on entry to the room it was freezing because the window was open the heating was broken and they knew and the toilet was soiled i was moved to a dingy single room and was not charged the next room was small but warm however i ve never been in a large bed that was so uncomfortable by this time i d had enough left in a rush and was charged around overall a very disappointing experience
