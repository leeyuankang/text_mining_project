we weren t allowed to buy coffee non alcohol drink from the bar in the evening despite it being open the staff on the front desk said that we had to be authorised to put it on our room tab which shouldn t have been an issue we wouldn t have minded paying in cash but this wasn t allowed either which doesn t really make sense
