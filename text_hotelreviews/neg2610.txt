to all weary travellers i booked a four night stay at the park grand hotel in london paddington having just arrived from a long journey and i checked into my room and went straight to bed not long after drifting off to the land of nod i awoke to a burning sensation severe itchiness to my upper torso neck hands and arms upon further inspection i soon discovered the bed was riddled with bedbugs and these free loaders i counted in the double digits after contacting reception i was greeted by the hotel manager and an assistant to assess the extent of the infestation by this time my bites had swollen to a collection of bright red bump the manager and equally his assistant were shocked at the state of the bed and they moved me to the room down the hallway the following morning i spoke to another manager to request a full refund for the previous night as well as requested relocation to a lower floor just in case my new friends decided to pay me another visit the manager advised me that a full refund was not practical and that the best they could do for me at the time was to give a discount on the room which i did not accept for the previous evening and wash my clothes to prevent any stowaways at one point throughout the discussion the manager even intimated that i may be responsible for the infestation and that he would investigate the situation adding insult to injury this certainly did put me at ease and i did not feel like a valued customer instead of giving the hotel the benefit of the doubt and continuing my stay i requested that my room be cancelled and to refund the remaining nights as anticipated i was told that i should give hours notice in order to cancel so i had to stay one more night before leaving to a neighbouring hotel i short the attitude of the hotel was woeful and the manner in which they dealt with their customers albeit the general staff was pleasant and helpful
