we stayed in a deluxe room after staying in a normal double room in this hotel before i was very disappointed the room was not as impressive as i had hoped and was not worth the i paid for a night stay the room was average size with all the same facilities of any other room the bathroom tiles were cracked in some places and the shower flooded the room every time it was used no matter how careful we were the room it s self was very dull and could use a lick of paint and maybe some colour to make it less depressing would have preferred to have stayed in a premier inn as the hilton was not worth the amount of money that i paid for it
