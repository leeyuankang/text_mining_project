poor service from reception staff room service spilt a whole glass of wine in my room and left me to clean it up with a towel from the bathroom was asked go to reception to put a credit card in to enable me to order room service when i said i was not happy to get dressed had just had a bath and go down to reception to do this they quickly just took the money from the card i had booked the room with so why the fuss about it not the sort of service i would expect from a hilton just another mediocre hotel room very smal with tired decor
