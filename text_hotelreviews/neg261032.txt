our experience was spoilt by the room temperature the room thermostat was turned to its lowest level of c but the air conditioning was not ever reaching the desired temperature for nights me and my wife didn t sleep so ultimately spoilt our stay as we were tired throughout the day we requested a fan which was supplied to us which worked for a short period until it was generally blowing the warm air around the room very uncomfortable days stay were not usually ones to complain but the room temperature spoilt our mini vacation
