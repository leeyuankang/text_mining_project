we decided to upgrade from a double to deluxe double and were severely disappointed not only was the deluxe room one of the smallest we ve stayed at in this country it was also unclean there were quite big coffee i hope it was anyway stains on the carpet and bath sealant missing mouldy we complained to reception and were told they could not move us because the hotel was full after much negotiation they finally knocked some money off but the size of the room for a hilton was small
