we have stayed at this hotel several times and always been very pleased but on this occasion it was a complete disaster we paid for an upgraded deluxe double room with a bath and asked for a ground floor room if possible we were told on arrival that we were to have a further complimentary upgrade but were then put in a horrible attic room with no bath the glass shower door was off its runners and fell on me while in the shower very dangerous there was mould in the shower and no slip mat the air conditioning did not work properly there was no hot water on the first evening the chambermaid forgot to clean the room and after two complaints we only got access to it at pm on the second day one of the receptionists spoke very little english so communication was nearly impossible the bar ran out of gin i pursued all of my complaints on checkout and was given a credit for one night s bar bill i get the impression that the problem is bad overall management of what is essentially a good hotel
