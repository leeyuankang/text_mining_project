extremely noisy as it is in a main road mornings we had no hot water for a shower they forgot to mention when booking that they take off you as a guarantee also staff let themselves in our room without knocking at when we were getting ready to go out to see if the maids had cleaned the room no apology for just walking in our room was very small and meant to be a deluxe double room so would hate to be in a standard room nice hotel and good location but definitely not worth the money they charge
