although everything else was excellant and the location was good with easy access to public transportation you did have to be careful about going too far in certain directions it is located near a sketchy neighborhood we needed to mail some packages and had to venture through an adjacent area it was definitely not a very safe area as long as you are near the hotel and the major areas it is a great place to stay
