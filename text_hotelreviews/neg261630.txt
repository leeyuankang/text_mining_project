breakfast wasn t amazing and the breakfast room was very hot with stuffy air the room was tiny even though it was supposed to be deluxe which isn t the smallest available with the toilet door right next to the bed although we asked for a twin room what we got was a room with two single beds pushed together so we had to move the furniture ourselves to put some space in between the beds which made the room even smaller
