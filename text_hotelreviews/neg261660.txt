my wife and i had a standard room which was a little short on storage space while my children had a superior suite not sure how that happened which was excellent with everything needed breakfast was a little expensive there is no restaurant at the hotel but this is no problem as we walked yards down the road to one of the many excellent bakery cafes for breakfast
