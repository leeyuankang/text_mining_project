any negatives are very small and would not prevent me from booking here again but deserve mentioning the room was so fabulous but the bed bordered on hard as a rock a firm bed is fine but this one was almost too firm and i d have to hesitate if booking for more than a couple days as it would become a problem on my joints also i would highly recommend that the hotel put a dish towel in the room as i ended up wasting paper towels when drying dishes but didn t want to run the dishwasher for only a coffee cup or wine glass lastly although checkout was at noon the housekeeper knocked on our door at and then stood outside waiting for us to leave she practically pushed past me as i rolled my suitcase out of the room a little weird and maybe a one off thing or a translation issue but still a bit rude as your final impression to an otherwise perfect stay
