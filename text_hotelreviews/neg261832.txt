the staff wasn t friendly at all no information were given the english they spoke was horrible and they haven t been helpful many times one of the biggest issues was the bathroom it was small without windows and after taking a shower the whole room was flooded because of the stupid construction all in all a well located hotel which is not worth the required prices
