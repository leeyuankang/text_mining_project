during check out at receptionist asked me to pay extra amount which is really strange because hotel was pre paid in advance two month before after discussions that we do not have breakfast in the hotel and we did not used any of other extra services he finally decided that everything is ok but i had ordered a taxi and after min waiting driver decide to move on unfortunately taxi charged me for a certain amount of money that s sad that due to that fact i lost some amount of my money and then was obliged to look other taxi which is not so funny at deep night we were use to go to airport
