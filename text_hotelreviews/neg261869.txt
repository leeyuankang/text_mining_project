lack of bar to unwind after a day s exploring the breakfast room could have been used but it wasn t mentioned that we could go there in evening just one member of staff working at breakfast so had to ask to clear tables no good morning etc as we arrived for breakfast on the first morning there was also unfortunately a large rowdy group in the beautifully decorated breakfast room who completely took over with their bags that we had to climb over they had no idea their voices were spoiling the ambience left with a headache had to ask for hot food to be replenished sausages looked very undercooked omelettes made to order would have been a good addition the reception area was very small with only one proper chair people tended to put their bags on it so nowhere to sit while waiting there was room for chairs near the fireplace a bottle of water was small but adequate room facing side street no hotel restaurant attached
