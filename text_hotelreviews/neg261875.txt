mini bar was never adequately stocked from beginning only bathrobe provided initially had to ask for another room was poorly made up for second night mini bar not stocked no coffee pods creamer or sweeteners replaced dirty spoons left to be used again i told reception and all we got was coffee pods had to use my own milk that i purchased i felt this really is unacceptable as we paid for these extras last time we stayed here we were in a normal room with free breakfast the breakfast was so poorly managed and chaotic that this time we opted to bring our own and make use of the fridge and nespresso coffee machine however this was difficult for the reasons above the reception staff are very friendly but the housekeeping is very poor i d still recommend this place based on the cleanliness and location but be mindful and don t get the breakfast
