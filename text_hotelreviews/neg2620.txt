i was very dissapointed with this property our daughter booked and paid for this as a birthday present we had hassle checking in the receptionist wanted a copy of the card for security as this wasnt our card we didnt have it we offered our own card to use and they wanted to refund our daughters card which would take days and take the money for the room from us there was no reason to do this and was a bad start to our trip also the pictures are very misleading the rooms were tiny i wouldnt return here but would definitely return to the area
