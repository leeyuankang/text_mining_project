i booked a twin room and also rang day before to ensure got twin beds which i was told i would when checked in there were none and i said i was happy to have roll away bed was given room that could accommodate but there were no roll away beds i could have booked another place a lot cheaper with twin beds and specifically checked with hotel so i could cancel if not available they said i would get so i feel ripped off
