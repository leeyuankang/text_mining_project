the concierge was very sarcastic when we asked for help on restaurant booking and wimbledon tickets he did not have to adopt such a condescending tone when speaking to hotel guests perhaps it is because we are asians we have given feedback to the reception about the concierge but we doubt they will do anything about it we approached the concierge on july morning to prove this is a real incident the toilet door in the hotel room is very old and makes alot of noise opening closing it the whole property looks aged and worn down a reno is much needed to spruce up the whole hotel
