room cleaning service quality was inconsistent stayed for seven nights but only once did we get wash cloths to go with the towel sets no hair conditioner ever a couple of times we weren t left with any toilet paper reserve just whatever was left of the roll on the dispenser the gym equipment was old and rusty very tiny room and the equipment that doubled as a lat pull and rower wasn t working and never fixed during the seven nights that we were there the location was the best thing about this hotel a few steps from an underground station that was served by two lines right next door is a grocery store and a dozen eateries within a few steps a half mile walk is a self service laundromat which we needed since we were traveling for a total of days
