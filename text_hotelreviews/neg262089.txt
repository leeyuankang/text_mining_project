the room was so tight and small like it was in an ibis hotel value for the money paid is very poor i would have made a better choice and the room photo on the web site does not show how much the room is small the bath is very very very tight that only one can barely fit inside i am not happy with the choice i made and will never repeat it anymore it is a rip off compared to another
