the rooms are very small there was no exhaust fan in the bathroom but this seems to be standard in london hotels the ceiling fan was actually hanging out of the roof the shower was in the bath and it didn t drain properly so we had to continually turn the shower off and let it drain or we had to stand in dirty water advised reception after first day and nothing was done the place is old and not well maintained again that seems to be a london thing we are paying a night around the corner and there is only one power socket that works and everything is run off a power board that is the next review overall the holiday inn was below par there was no response from any management about any issues we were going to stay another nights but we ended up going elsewhere we paid about aud a night here and definitely not to standard beds are old as are the pillows very disappointing and the last time i will stay in the holiday inn anywhere three strikes in countries
