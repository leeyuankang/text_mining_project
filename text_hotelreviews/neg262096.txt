didn t get any sleep door shakes everytime wind caught it making a banging noise i explained to the front desk in the morning and she made me feel awkward saying if i wasn t happy i should have moved rooms but i was trying to sleep through it very disappointed from the judgment and i didn t know what was possible this was the first time i had organised my own hotel stay otherwise definitely a very good hotel and clean check in service by gil was very informative and welcoming
