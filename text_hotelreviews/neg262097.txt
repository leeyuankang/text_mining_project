checking in procedure was terrible i booked rooms for nights for a hell of a lot of money it took us almost minutes to get our keys although it was all prepaid the respective lady who helped us never made eye contact for the amount i paid i did not even feel welcome at all that lady should not do that type of work because she doesn t understand hospitality at all another thing are the elevators they are living their own lives many guests complained me too
