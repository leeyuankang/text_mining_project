i was treated very badly on reception upon arrival i was told because my name seemed to be slightly different to the booked name that i did not have a booking my pronounceation of my name as an english man differed from the receptionists so he assumed there was no booking for me stephen if my first name and he assumed that it was pronounced steffan so assumed i did not have a booking once i pointed this out at pm after telling him i had had a very difficult journey and was very tired and had an important day the next day he tried to fob me off with a single bed room when i had specifically requested and paid extra to ensure booking a double room i was then told there were no more double rooms available and i insisted that that was what i ordered and that was what he would have to supply he took another mins to then give me a room which when i got to it i discovered it stank of cigarettes had a broken shower head and was quite unclean i was too tired to try and do anything about it at that stage and decided i would never use that hotel again terrible service treated me with disrespect and fob me off
