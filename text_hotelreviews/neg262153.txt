we had a room on the third floor for what we paid it was small it needed updating it was very noisy with traffic on the cromwell road and the district line must pass directly below the hotel the bed was extremely hard and we had little sleep with the uncomfortable bed and the noise we were disappointed with breakfast we had to ask four times before they brought us tea the only eggs were very greasy fried or insipid scrambled no choice of bread just a stale breadstick unless you wanted toast definately poor value for money don t make the mistake of booking a non refundable room through booking com as cheaper rooms were available nearer the time on booking com and probably even cheaper direct with the hotel
