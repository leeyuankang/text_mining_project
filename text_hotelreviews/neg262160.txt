i had few comments honestly i requested a room with a view and i booked in advanced they told me they couldn t find one at the time of my booking which was a shame i got in the room and the bathroom was dirty found few strands of hair on the sink the bathroom itself wasn t good at all it doesn t have a door but rather a sliding door which isn t nice last thing is i didn t like the fact that i don t have a safe in my room and that i have to go downstairs to get my valuable things every time i need them or i need to put them in a safe place
