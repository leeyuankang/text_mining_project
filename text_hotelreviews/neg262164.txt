we could only get the basic twin room at the holiday inn and it said on my booking information that i had a non smoking room in actual fact it was definitely a smoking room even the clean towels stank of smoke the duvets were narrow and did not cover you i did however ask for another duvet and was given a large very fluffy duvet which was wonderful unfortunately and despite asking for our room not to be serviced my husband s swiss army knife appears to have disappeared during our visit we enquired about it as we used it in the room but it has not shown up it was an object of sentimental value to my husband who was given it by our son now in the us we could only have lost it during our stay i thought that the room was expensive for what it was i would definitely prefer a better room in future
