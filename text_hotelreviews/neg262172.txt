horribly dated room decor not changed since the the photos on the website are not representative bed was hard as a rock and the double duvet was far too small after talking to reception staff were really helpful they sent up another one which was even smaller spent the night wrestling for covers with my wife she always wins the lobby looks good the rest of the hotel is very shabby and not worth the price even for london
