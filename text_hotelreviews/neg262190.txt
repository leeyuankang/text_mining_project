i have checked the option of arriving early for checkin and they didnt bother to keep that as a priority instead they told me to wait five more hours to get a room after hour flight they need to make sure that they do not have requests of early check in if thats the case i got surprised lyer on that i can jump the que of early check in by buying breakfast for which i refused to do i hve then asked them to gove me a call when my room was ready but they hve refused when i spoke to the duty manager he then told me hell do so abd he was kind enough to give me a room after three hour wait instead of five the hotel needs to work on their hospitatlity management abd customer service as i am an ihg reward member they always forget to add my points
