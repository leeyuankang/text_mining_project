i contacted the hotel when booking apron weeks before travelling to say that we required a high room as wanted a brill view which we got i also explained that it was to celebrate our wedding anniversary nothing was acknowledged about this not even a couple of chocolates on the pillows i know everyone is budget cutting but for goodness sake a couple of chocs on the pillows would have made us realise that you actually took interest in us and our special weekend but no that was a disappointment the drawers in the room didn t shut once clothes were put in them so dread going to the loo in the night the bathroom really does need a shuttable door not the sliding door that doesn t even meet the edge and has no lock whatsoever i know we ve been married years but i have never pooped within earshot of my hubby without a proper closeable door being there basics really get the drawers sorted get the bathroom door sorted and i would consider returning
