on check in our room toilet was found to have been used and left un flushed for many days the clues were the lower water level in the bowl the stains left on the side of the bowl as the water level had dropped the unmentionables floating in it and also really bad smell we reported it to a lady a reception and she wasn t too concerned only offering to get it cleaned hardly the point no safe in our room empty mini bar and why were we given a disabled room surely that should have been kept for well the disabled it didn t bother us only that it felt a bit like parking in a disabled bay
