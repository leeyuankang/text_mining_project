they didn t have a double room available for me at and they said through booking com they don t receive these information so i waited about for the room to be ready the facilities in the bedroom is probably the oldest i have every seen bath i didn t even want to try toilet didn t have a proper door to close and you know the consequences in the room you don t even have some water to drink now alcohol or anything not even a tooth paste the breakfast is a simple english breakfast and they wait until something is finished completely and then after at least minutes somebody will realise and refill overal it should be a start hotel in my opinion will never go anywhere close it again
