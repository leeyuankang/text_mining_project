the size of the bathroom was a great let down to our stay i d booked an executive room no so it came as a surprise that the bathroom was so small the tap on the sink was broken and was a real hazard if children were to use it as part of an executive room deal bathrobes and slippers along with mini bar should have been provided but none were i requested at reception twice for them to be provided but none were when we came to check out and i brought this issue to the duty manages attention he kindly adjusted my final bill to reflect my disappointment if these items aren t available then please remove it from your room description on your webb pages
