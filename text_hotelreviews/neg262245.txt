our room was not very clean the general cleanliness and maintenance at the hotel was not as modern as the hotel website described we were given a room on floor and told it had a wonderful view over london but the seals on the window were broken as it was full of condensation inside the double glazing unit so we could not see out of it the room was also cold and very draughty the vent in the bathroom was stuffed with tissues i think a previous guest must have been trying to stop the cold draught while in the shower the sink took an age to drain the fire alarm went off at during our stay and woke all the guests up there was obviously not a fire but the staff were very rude and unhelpful when we enquired about what had happened
