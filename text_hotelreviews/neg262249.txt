this holiday in has been around for a long time and the decoration are dated rooms are very small and furnishing is very very old for the price they are charging for this type of business you need to invest in your properties as well as your people its really time to have a complete rennovation the fact that they are in a top location with high demand does not mean that they could deliver such bad quality for the price they are charging ths comment is directed at the hotel owners not the people working there
