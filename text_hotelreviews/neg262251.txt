we were randomly woken up by an alarm at which lasted half a minute and the reception wouldn t pick up the phone when we wanted to ask for an explanation everyday the housekeeping crew started their round at rough awakening the first morning and then we had to sleep with the do not disturb sign stuck to the door every night i understand the hotel is big so they have to start early if they want to be done by but on a saturday and they were quite noisy too
