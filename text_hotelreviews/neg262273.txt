what i didn t like was arriving at the check in time to be told that our room would be hours there was no reason for this my parent who had booked the room as a present had to ring the booking line and was told that it was not acceptable and the room should be ready after a little long wait we got in our room at the receptionist who dealt with us was rude and we felt that as year olds we were being taken advantage of especially as other people were checking in around us
