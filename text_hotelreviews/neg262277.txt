the rooms were quite tired looking the duvet was as thin as a piece of paper and the bath was chipped a bottle of water and a can of diet coke cost over although to be fair it is in kensington overall if you want a cheap ish one night stay for convenience for a conference or an exam you could do worse than a stay here although if you d prefer not to worry about what you re picking up from the very dusty dirty carpet in the room then perhaps pay more and stay somewhere else
