the taking my money without consent or knowledge the deceit and being messed around i stayed here dec specifically said no prepayment necessary so when i rang to say we d be late checking in i was happy when no mention of prepayment was made all would be well and they would have our key ready on arrival we arrived to check in and paid in cash and the remaining on my card the accommodation was basic and small and the bathroom door had no lock also for such an international hotel chain the tv channels were very limiting unless you wanted to pay more money we checked out the following morning again with no mention of prepayment however the following day having arrived home i realised my bank account had less money than it should after checking with the bank and the hotel the hotel had without my consent or knowledge preauthorised my card i was told it would be released but with it being so close to christmas it wasn t in time by i d still not had my money back i rang the bank and was told the hotel had preauthorised my card again after we had left and again without my consent or knowledge i rang hotel was told i had all my facts wrong even though they d been confirmed by the bank and i was given different details by the clerk which didn t add up basically they took my payment times in all and i m still waiting to receive any money back huge con be very careful they lied to cover at best their gross negligence at worst their fraud
