the pricing we wanted to book days and the second day was going to be nearly the cost of the first night i phoned the hotel and they couldn t improve on the fee so we went elsewhere for the next night that day the cost of the room dropped considerably this is not unique to your hotel but some crazy rip off system is going on with hotel pricing and needs to be more stable and regulated also bathroom grout was grubby in places and carpets in the room were looking a bit old and used
