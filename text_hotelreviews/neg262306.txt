two rooms booked months in advance were floors apart rooms in need of redecoration looking tired especially the bathroom with fixtures falling off and mold buildup around the tiles rooms basic and small breakfast time on a sunday did not cater for the masses guests having to queue for minutes for a hot breakfast this is unacceptable and certainly not worth as a consequence of time delays i could not stay for breakfast guests are better off paying less and eating elsewhere for breakfast as there are lots of choices externally to the hotel that provide better value choice and service
