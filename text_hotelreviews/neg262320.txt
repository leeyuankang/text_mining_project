one hotel staff tried to open our door at night without ringing the bell apparently he got into the wrong room to deliver a light bulb fortunately our door has a mechanical lock otherwise he would get into our room while we were sleeping one would expect a hotel staff to ring the bell to check if someone is inside the room but he did not the internet service is restricted to two devices only when it is linked to my wife s mobile phone and my notebook computer my mobile phone has no internet service
