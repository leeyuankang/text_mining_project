i ve stayed here before and it was great this time thoufh there was a moth invasion in my room also the cleaning staff will hunt you down each day trying to clean your room i m the type who doesn t like to get her room cleaned since i really don t need it and i don t make a mess and the mess i do make is with my paperwork but it s one that i ll pack up when i leave so not too bad for the cleaning service but on one of the days i took down the do not disturb sign from my door since it was after i came back an hour later to my room cleaned and all of my stuff moved around i figured if it was after they wouldn t come most services wouldn t but they were very persistent if you like that great if not you really have to tell the front desk right away
