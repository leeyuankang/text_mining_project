unfortunately there were numerous let downs at this hotel we had stayed there a year previously which was brilliant which is why we chose to go back however this time was a very different story i had called in advance to see if something could be arranged for my parents anniversary as a surprise for them however on arrival this hadn t been done and only one room i ll get to that next was ready we were there before the check in but as we had to be some place at that time i had called in advance to arrange an early check in the lady i spoke on the reception desk wasn t the friendliest or very helpful when i asked her about the rooms or mentioned my mum and dads anniversary surprise it seems that my phone calls in preparation for what should have been a special trip had fallen on deaf ears until i asked to speak to the manager at the time who then brought up much later on a small fruit plate bottle of wine and card the rooms were very dated and small i understand they have packed in as many as possible but the doors in and out of the room didn t fully open and only one person could walk around the bed or the room at a time as it was so small as well as being small the room was very dated and old fashioned we ordered food in the hotel bar as were in a rush at lunchtime and my dad couldn t go out and walk far to find a restaurant but once again since our trip in the food quality had slipped and wasn t half as tasty as what we had the previous year and their choice of juices as we weren t drinking at lunchtime were very limited unfortunately after a very happy trip to this hotel in the standards have very much slipped and we were left disappointed
