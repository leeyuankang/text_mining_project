i booked the room under my name and my card details but possibly due to a booking com error it was listed under my son s name and we struggled to get the booking found on initial arrival this seemed to be a gap in communication between the web site and the hotel which resulted in a year old being named as the main guest a very stressful minutes if i had not had my husband at home to end on e mails it would not have been so rapidly resolved
