there seemed to be no proper communication i booked breakfast on booking com at a discount rate when i got to the hotel there was nothing on record i was told it was ok because as i m hosting a big charity event that night my breakfast might be complimentary the next morning there was still nothing on my booking at the hotel and i had to pay full price for my breakfast even though i had the confirmation email and showed it as well as i have ihg membership
