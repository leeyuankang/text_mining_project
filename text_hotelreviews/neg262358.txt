we stayed for nights on the day my son found bottles of water under the bed certainly left by previous guests this means the room had not been properly vacuumed before we checked in if at all hadn t it been for this incident and i would have rated the cleanliness of the room higher apart from this and unreliable wifi in the room our stay was very enjoyable and we will be going back
