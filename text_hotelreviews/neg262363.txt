myself and my friend booked a twin room when we arrived they said they had double booked the twin rooms so we had to go in a double which we were not happy with they upgraded us to the superior double and moved us to standard twin next day which was exactly the same as the superior as far as we could see a bit disappointed to have to be shifted around rooms as only a night stay but overall happy with our stay at this hotel
