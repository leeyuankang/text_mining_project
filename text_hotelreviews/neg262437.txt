i was given an upgrade from a standard twin room to a double which wasn t ideal as we were two women sharing we had waited until to check in to get this upgrade after arriving earlier but we weren t told until that the room would be a double when we got into the room there was only one robe and one pair of slippers we phoned to ask for another set and they never arrived on our last morning we could check out at but the housekeeping rang our doorbell and came in the room at and then again at when we were trying to sleep in
