the hotel itself is a vast monstrosity with hundreds of rooms the outside is a real eyesore and although the inside is clean and tidy my room s decor looked like it was about years out of date considering the price i paid i felt an upgrade was in order for the entire hotel the staff were relatively helpful but seemed overworked and stressed the computer system was out on the day i checked out and the woman behind the checkout was swearing at it constantly and audibly very unprofessional i wouldn t stay there again it was too huge too impersonal and too full of airline staff strictly a stay there once and forget about it kind of place didn t sample any of the food so can t comment on that aspect if all you want is a bed for the night then it s fine albeit expensive for what you get
