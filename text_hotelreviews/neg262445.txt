the room was poor a c was hot at first but then they fix it dirty windows broken bed weels smelly pillows matrass pillar right close to the loo seat was uncomfortable no milk for the complimentary tea until i bought myself then they realized and kept some the next day i think the hotel policy to give lowest room slandered to booking com customers i have noticed this when i talked to the receptionist last time as she suggested to book directly through their official website for a better room which i didn t like at all
