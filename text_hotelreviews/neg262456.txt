our hotel room windows could do with a bit of cleaning but the hotel is huge i m sure it would be impossible to keep the windows squeaky clean at all times also we were on the floor and could hear traffic noise quite clearly i don t personally mind this is just a tip for those sensitive to noise an upper floor might be a good choice
