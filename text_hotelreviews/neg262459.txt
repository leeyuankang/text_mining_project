i ve stayed at this hotel a number of times this time i wasn t happy the check in process is very slow staff assigned me a room with someone already in it i woke up some poor guy at midnight just careless handling by the staff the beds offer no support and need to be replaced pillows are old and tired shower drains slow so after mins you re standing in water just basic stuff that they are missing the mark on
