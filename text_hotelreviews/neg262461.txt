at breakfast i was siting next to my dad s table i left my pot of tea and half finished cup and a glass of juice at the table to get something to eat when i returned i found a waitress had showed a new couple to my table and cleared away my infused things i had to find a new table away from my dad apparently you have to leave a bag or something on the table i didn t like having to move half way through my breakfast especially as there were many unused tables around that the waitress could have showed the new couple to also my room was for a disabled person the bath had a chair in it i had a very squashed shower and the bed was way too low and not wide enough for two i woke up feeling very uncomfortable
