while the location was good you could hear the nearby train as the south kensington underground station is above ground we were on the floor so it wasn t a huge issue but might be if staying on a lower floor the beds in the room are very firm and quite uncomfortable if you are used to a softer cushioned bed they have the rooms temperature controlled for the season so you aren t able to put the air conditioning on if you like it cooler when you sleep so we had to sleep with the window open
