as our flight leaving london was at for practical reasons we kindly requested for a later check out at which was another above the benefit of a late check out at sadly it was not possible instead we were informed that we could extend our check out but with a fee of hr since we stayed nights with them we thought it was not that much to ask for the extra without a fee but overall still satisfied with our stay
