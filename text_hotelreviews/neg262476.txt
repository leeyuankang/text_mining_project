the room was looking a little tired could do with a refurb no safe or iron we had a problem when we went to eat i have a hearing disorder and as most of the staff are foreign we had a communication problem they couldn t understand me and i simply couldn t hear or understand them the staff were all universally friendly this was not their fault but a hotel management fault
