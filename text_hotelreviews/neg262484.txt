european hotel rooms are on the small side we had a twin deluxe and it was small though clean and comfortable beds this was fine and didn t bother us while some early reviews seemed to imply that this hotel was dated and old the interior was not true at all although the hotel is a traditional high rise the hotel interior rooms and furnishings inside looked modern clean and were perfectly fine
