i did not like the restaurant the food was mediocre at best and the service was very slow even when i wanted to pay and leave i couldn t change the temperature in the room it was very cold i also didn t like the fact that you couldn t opt out of room cleaning for a day even though someone was in there everyday and the bottom sheet was never changed the same spot was on the sheet in the same place every day the only sign i had on the door said please clean my room which seemed a little ridiculous since they did anyway i didn t even have a do no disturb sign even though i said something to the front desk about it
