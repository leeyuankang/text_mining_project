first impressions are fundamental in the hotel industry and way our check in was handled was well below what we expec from holiday inn the person that checked us in clearly had no knowledge about a booking com reservation and could not find our booking despite we giving her all elevant info eventually excuse was that booking com had not given our name correctly we indicated we use booking com often and never had any similar problem only to then be confronted by another staff person at reception that was rude and lacked any professional attitude only when i threatened to report situation to both booking com as well as to tripadvisor to whom i write on a regular basis did then a manager at my reqest did intervene and in a proper professional manner and offering an apology for the way the check in was handled but the damage of first impressions was done and this manager whilst corteous professional still hinted that the confusion with the name was booking com fault and i thus suggest that you do check with holiday inn this situation
