the receptionist that checked me in forgot to mention that an accessible room had been allocated to me this meant the the room itself was larger than most but the bathroom was not ideal for a guest that didn t need special facilities the loo is high and the sink low just above my knees for example i could have asked for a room change but didn t as i was only there for one night and checked in late
