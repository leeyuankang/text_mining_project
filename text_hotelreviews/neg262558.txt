we have stayed in holiday inns around the world in the last year we have also stayed at this location several times inc back to the forum days as a treat we booked nights in an exec higher storey room and were given a floor room out of upon arrival our key cards were not cut as exec so did not work for some services it took about mins to register us although they had all our details from our booking months earlier receptionist told us where the buffet breakfast was served but did not tell us that we could use the business lounge in all very disappointed with reception but everything else was o k as usual
