the only down side to the hotel is the beds and pillows first the pillows are like bricks i recommend taking your own pillow if you have to you wake up with sore red ears off them also the beds are not too comfy could be better i didn t want to think what our room would of been like without the free upgrade but overall for the price i paid which was it wasn t bad as that included breakfast for you can pay a lot more in london for the same service
