second time i ve visited this hotel first time my husband and i were bumped this time when told they were moving me i stood my ground and insisted they gave me the room i d booked don t trust them no consideration for woman travelling alone you can imagine my shook and horror as gentlemen came to check in next to me and were given rooms without hesitation or treat o f being moved my checking in experience was so upsetting i did not bother asking for help when my rooms heating wasn t working so i froze all night didn t sleep and felt totally upset when asked on checking out if i d had a good stay i said no and explained why oh sorry to hear that bye was the response i recieved from the polite but obviously not empowered reception staff beware of the dubious checking in policy
