we were woken at on a saturday morning to ask when we would be checking out check out time was we were then disturbed again at to see if we were still in the room when we mentioned this at checkout we were told we should have used the do not disturb switch in the room i think this happens because you can check out by app whenever you like so they do not know who is still in the hotel
