stayed here sunday and monday night july the single bedroom was just too small the toilet wasn t flushing very well the tap in the sink was missing a nozzle so water was spraying all over me when i had the tap on full but worst of all is that this room was off the main corridor beside where the housekeeper stored stuff and there was constant noise from early morning there was also some works being done outside my door room see picture when i checked into the hotel i asked if i could get an upgrade the girl asked if i stayed here before told her no but that i had stayed in a radisson blu in ireland i was then told they were full i really don t believe that was the case at all also there was no mini bar in the room really disappointed that i didn t get a good nights sleep the hotel obviously knew they were doing works outside the door very inconsiderate it costs a lot to stay in london and what i was given and the sleep experience i had was certainly not value for money
