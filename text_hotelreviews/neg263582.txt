there seems to be an unpublished uninformed internal policy that you cannot exceed pounds credit which lets face it in central london barely gets you a round of drinks without being hassled to settle your bill despite having credit status transparency is required to allow guests to feel welcomed more than left feeling as if they re going to run off without paying bar bills are not auto credited with your pound discount again this means you have to go and ask for it to be discounted it s supposed to be an offering not necessitating a guest to ask these policies are not at all guest friendly and create bad impressions
