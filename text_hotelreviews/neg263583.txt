used to staying next door in the radisson bloomsbury much better all round thought we d give this slightly cheaper option a try as it s just next door conflicting info from staff some of it clearly meant to just get the guest to shut up verging on rude windows in our room sealed closed terrible when taking a shower and airless during warm summer nights attitude in the bar is pretentious and service is less than impressive the new online check out bill option has no option to remove the optional yet added service charges very busy due to being cheaper than it s sister property next door and the property feels it s entitled to give as it wishes due to consistent max occupancy we also choose where to stay and it won t be at this hotel anymore
