after checking in online on friday for an overnight stay on saturday sunday our room number was given as during our time in london on saturday we received a text to say that our room number had changed to room presumably because another guest had seen the room and decided it was too small and had requested something bigger the room itself was very small with minimal facilities and only a two foot gap between bed and the walls on all three sides more space and better facilities would have been provided at a travel lodge at around a third of the price the only view outside the window was of pipework with no view of the sky available from the window we booked this hotel for a better experience than staying at a travel lodge however in future we will stick with the travel lodge rather than waste our money on this overpriced accommodation a very unsatisfactory experience all round
