first double room we were given was very small the double bed was pushed up to the wall so only one person could get out of bed easy the other person would have to climb over the other one the room was just bigger than a double bed with nowhere to sit very uncomfortable luckily we asked to be moved and where given a very nice and much larger room this made all the difference to our stay
