i was woken on morning around by the fire alarm going off times during a minute period for about seconds each time by the third time there was no chance of being able to go back to sleep but there was no apology for the disrupted night i was woken on morning by the sound of dripping water and i discovered that there was a leak from the air conditioning and a pool of water on the floor
