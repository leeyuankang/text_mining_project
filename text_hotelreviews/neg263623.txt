the room we were booked into was so small the very small double bed was right against the wall so there was no way to get out of bed that side this meant the person sleeping that side had to clamber over the other person or shuffle to the end of the bed obviously this immediately woke the other person in addition the only place to put cases was at the end of the bed so in practice it was nigh on impossible to get out of the end of the bed as a couple past retirement age this was not a good thing and neither of us got a good nights sleep the next morning i asked to be moved and this was done without quibble to a larger room with access to both sides of the bed unfortunately the mattress was so hard i didn t sleep that night either all in all although the location was great it was way too expensive and there too much hassle for a relaxed visit to london i will not be staying there again
