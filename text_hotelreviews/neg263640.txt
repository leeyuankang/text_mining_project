the gym was a disappointment a couple of treadmills a crosstrainer a bike and a few dumbbells not enough for a thorough workout the concierge was helpful and recommended the world s very first ymca an historic place which is next door and is a great place for sports if you re willing to pay the extra money the shower was really small and without a proper handheld shower you ll have to perform gymnastics to get properly clean
