there was a small flood in the bathroom and the green light for service required was turned on in the afternoon but no one attended the room there were durty trays with dirty dishes in the corridor near our room but whole day no one attended the left overs in front of other guests room front desk employee was acting not really professional about accomodating us in the room before we actually pay for the room so we stayed for hours in the lobby of the hotel in order to solve the card limit issue instead of doing it in the room
