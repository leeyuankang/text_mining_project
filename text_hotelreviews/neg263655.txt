the double room was much smaller than anticipated not the size depicted in the photos on the website unfortunately we felt that the dining room staff at breakfast were not working effectively on day one we were shown to our table and told that someone would take our order for tea coffee but this never happened instead we had to actively seek out somone and ask for it the same again on day two likewise we were never asked if we wanted to order from the a la carte selection again having to seek out someone to place an order when it became apparent we weren t going to be offered it on our last day we were wise to this so we asked the waiter who showed us to the table to bring us tea and that was fine a little more emphasis placed on welcoming the customers rather than looking at the technology mobile used to identify us as guests would have made the experience better we hope this constructive criticism provides the staff with an opportunity to improve
