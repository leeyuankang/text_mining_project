received an email on the day we were due to arrive asking us to check in online which i did and was advised that all we had to do was collect our room keys from the concierge however the concierge sent us to the check in desk where we had to check in anyway so online check in seems a little pointless the person that checked us in gave us no information about the hotel facilities breakfast or where we might find our room he literally said two words to us he also seemed reluctant to take payment for the room when we arrived and was just not very helpful in general staff we encountered all seemed a bit withdrawn room was quite small which we didn t mind as the location was amazing and we got a good deal however i imagine some people will get burned if they book late and pay through the nose
