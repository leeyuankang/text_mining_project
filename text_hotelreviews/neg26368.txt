absolutely unresponsive staff air conditioner in my room was not working for the consecutive days they didn t corrected it when things become our of control they put a pedestal fan instead of changing the room or correcting the ac any call to room service would talk even days to service so little options in breakfast and absolutely nil options for vegetarians overall very bad experience
