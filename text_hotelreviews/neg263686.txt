the room was much smaller than i expected i expect small in london however i booked a standard twin room which is advertised at squared and my room was well below this it also did not look like the twin room in the photo used to sell the room to me so beware the bathroom was minuscule think one spot to stand in sink in front of you step left you re in the shower and right you re in the toilet i think there should be an option to select a bath as i had no choice when booking breakfast the bacon was very fatty and not cooked very much there could have been more sweet items at breakfast e g muffins and it was very difficult to toast bread properly using their machine there were no biscuits with the tea and coffee in the room or otherwise all in all the room size was my main bugbear the rest were minor issues
