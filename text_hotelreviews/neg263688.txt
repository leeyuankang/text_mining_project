i thought i was booking a twin room and the email confirmation of my booking from booking com specified i had asked for two singles however when i tried to check in i discovered that the kenilworth sees all such bookings from booking com as doubles i was given a twin as it happened to be available but that was pure luck and i was told that many people expecting a twin booked through booking com at this hotel are disappointed anyone who wants to be certain that they will get a twin room should not book this hotel via booking com the phone number provided by booking com in the email confirmation was actually for the bloomsbury radisson blu instead
