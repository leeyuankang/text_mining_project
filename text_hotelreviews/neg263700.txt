we were disappointed with our room from the photos on your site we had hoped for a lovely top quality room especially as we had gone for a special occasion only to find we were up in the attic with low sloping ceilings which my partner kept hitting his head on each time he got out of bed the room was also small and pokey as was the bathroom
