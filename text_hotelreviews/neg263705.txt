although extra pillows were provided they too were over plump and not necessarily a good alternative was a bit disappointed with breakfast great choice but served on the cold plates that were already on the table and no apparent alternatives no side plates or chance of one very good choice of continually replenished breakfast items but coffee only warm and tea mediocre what is the problem with promoting what is good about britain in a great quality product like yorkshire tea is a lot of money for this breakfast which although plentiful is not a quality product
