the staff were barely able to grasp english and had poor customer service attitudes at our table were advised that we had to eat up as they needed to clear away to prepare for breakfast having just arrived from italy where the serving staff could not have been more accommodating helpful and friendly the attitudes exhibited by the grosvenor staff was poor and unwelcoming an example the concierge staff looked on as our party struggled up the entrance stairs and through the doors both on arrival and exit no offer of assistance was made nor was any offer to take our luggage up to our rooms for a hotel aspiring to be stars the service was poor and the food and drinks over priced this is a large hotel and the breakfast self serving area is very small the lack of attentiveness by waiting staff continued to breakfast time where consistently we had to go and ask for coffee refills
