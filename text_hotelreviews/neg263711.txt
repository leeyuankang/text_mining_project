room was quite small and the beds weren t comfortable noise of showers and bathroom area in neighbouring room was quite loud particularly as the guests in the next room took a shower at on other occasion they chose to knock the adjoining wall assuming this was to get our attention not sure if there was a problem with booking com or the hotel but room was booked and paid months in advance but had the annoying and embarrassing situation where had to go through whole booking again and even prove my identity never had this problem with other booking com bookings i was told room would be ready between but had to wait til half past three
