looks like again smallest room available given to booking com clients room if you need to know shower door would not stay closed whilst in use reported to reception breakfast a total shambles many guests including us cleared our own tables people waiting to be seated but up to tables still not cleared staff very slow and there seemed to be no supervison or organisation from the the duty manager in the breakfast area my accomodation did not inc breakfast which the door person informed me of had to tell him many times to add to my room noticed many other people coming in via another door who just sat down and were not checked on checkout my bill was incorrect as they had not added the breakfast staff said not posted from the breakfast area had to argue that we had had breakfast and would like to pay it was my wife s birthday and this nearly ruined the whole trip not up to the normal rad standards cost was not a issue but i really felt that this was not value for money
