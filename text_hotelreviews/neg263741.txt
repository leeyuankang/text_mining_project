expensive breakfast but there are many nice cafes in the vicinity so that s not really an issue although staff were really friendly and helpful there was the occasional absent mindedness the concierge offered to send up my bags to room but didn t so i had to call twice and still ended up getting them myself them as nobody came and after hrs i really needed my charger which was in the suitcase also cleaners came very late in the evening to tidy up room and forgot to add toilet paper
