we stayed at a premier inn in enfield the previous evening for various reasons and were looking forward to an even more comfortable night at radisson on leaving the radisson we both commented that we wish we would have stayed at a premier inn and paid travel costs into soho instead i understand the location is reflected in the price but we paid circa more and the premier inn had more comfortable beds brighter cleaner room i had to do my makeup with the assistance of my phone torch etc it s all just a bit lack luster it s not bad enough to complain but i most definitely wouldn t return
