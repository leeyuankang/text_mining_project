our room was right opposite a service lift which was noisy in the mornings and the afternoons also some guests were using it instead of the proper lift so they were queuing right outside our door on one occasion our room was not tidied in the evening and on another our cups were not replaced the package we had included breakfast as there was not other option however we found we were paying for coffree juice yogurt and fruit and a roll or croissant when there was one compared to some people s full english which we did not want when we checked out we did not appreciate the girl in reception saying yes to us whilst staring at her computer screen she couldn t even be bothered to look up and it wasn t busy there would be more room in the bathrooms if you got rid of the baths and just had a walk in shower this would be easier to get into as well please put up notices asking people to talk quietly in the corridors this applies to staff as well the per night for use in the bar included in the package is a rip off it s use it or lose it and we got scammed even more as we were brought a more expensive brandy then we asked for we changed to lager on subsequent nights then the receptionist at check out had the nerve to ask us to pay an extra service charge tip for the waiters as she told us this was not included in the
