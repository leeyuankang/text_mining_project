not many negatives at all two slight little niggles in my mum s bedroom there was a nasty brown stain on the curtain and also in her shower cubicle it was a little dirty around the sealant between the tiles and the shower glass i also felt the hotel was slightly overpriced compared to what i ve stayed in before around london
