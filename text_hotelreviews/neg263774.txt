rude reception staff on check in told me i hadn t booked breakfast when i had argued with me until i said i d get the booking confirmation email then he checked the system and acknowledged that i had breakfast booked but no apology went to the room i had specifically booked a twin room not double twin and written in the special requests box that it needed to be twin beds arrived at a very small double room went to reception to be told rooms booked through booking com are not guaranteed and in future i should ring to make sure of a twin room luckily twin room available again no apology told breakfast at true for saturday but not for sunday so missed out on breakfast due to early train helpful manager did however get us some croissants and pain au chocolat and tea coffee room dusty behind beds obvious not hands and knees searching for dust air conditioning very noisy had to switch it off in the middle of the night but room very hot by the morning constant beeping traffic noise outside poor double glazing should have been a nice stay in a nice hotel but can t say i was that impressed
