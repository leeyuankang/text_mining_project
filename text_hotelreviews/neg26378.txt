very poor access for disabled there was no ramp and my wife who travels in a wheelchair but can walk a few steps had to climb about steps up to the front door once inside there was lift access to our room there was a notice outside the hotel requesting disabled people to ring for access but the bell had been removed as had any previous lift or ramp
