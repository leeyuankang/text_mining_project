the fire alarm went off times during the night on our stay so we had very little sleep one member of the reception staff was extremely rude to us when we complained we asked to speak to someone else and spoke to customer relations who was extremely polite and refunded us one night s stay it is a pity that one female receptionist is clearly in the wrong job
