expected more of the luxury brand on arrival we noticed that we did not get x person bedding as requested via booking com the reason being that my comment was too long and they only received the or so characters in their system in stead of asking what i wanted they made the bed with standard double bedding this resulted in us having to wait for an hour more before finally going to sleep when arriving at midnight by our biological clock next time i ll book a more standard chain hotel outside of the center and take the tube where we want to go
