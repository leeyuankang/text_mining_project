i left my pandora bracelet in room when i rang to explain this there was apparently nothing you could do and it was not found i know i left it in the bathroom so it would have been there when it was cleaned the bracelet is so very precious to me as this was a gift from a family member who has now passed on i don t understand how it can t have been there when it was cleaned as i know i left it in the bathroom i am not happy with your lack of service
