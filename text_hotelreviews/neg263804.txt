i had no idea that you could still smoke hotels so didn t know that you had to request a non smoking room we were on the mezzanine floor which is apparently a smoking floor you knew this by the smell the corridor outside our room smelt horrendous the view from our room was all the boiler pipes and that was it lovely so was this room value for money definitely not i mentioned both these points on checkout the guy on reception passed on my comments and i was told that the hotel had my email address and would be in touch i have not heard a thing ps i am a smoker so can t think how bad that must be for non smokers
