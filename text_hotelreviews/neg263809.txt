i decided to stay at radisson blue with my daughter as our holiday together as mother and daughter as i thought we would be made to feel special unfortunately this was not so as when we went to check out lukas who i imagine was the manager and who had checked us in had an air of arrogance around him as he thought we were with the lady in front of us who clearly had a single room as both himself and remus struggled to sort out her tab although the room was comfortable and the hotel very nice due to the arrogance of lukas this left my daughter very upset and basically spoilt our holiday
