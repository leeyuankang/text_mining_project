i booked a standard double room and based on the photos provided by the hotel of the room standard and previous stays at the radisson blu i can only say i am extremely disappointed the photos were very misleading and i was allocated what can only be described as a box room at the end of the corridor it certainly wasn t what i was lead to believe the room would look like and barely provided adequate space to walk around the bed i have visited many different hotels within the chain and always been happy with my stay but this will unfortunately make me think twice about staying there again
