the size of the room was the smallest i have stayed in and there was very little natural light from the window but i have not stayed in central london before and there was very little light from the window as it looked inwards checked in on line asked to select a room my wife went for a lower floor room as she is a smoker the pics of the room were misleading as in they look bigger and brighter we went to the bar at around and there was no food or even a bar menu as they had finished and that was that apart from some nuts
