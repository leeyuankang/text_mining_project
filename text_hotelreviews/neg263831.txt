i found it a little disappointing when checking out to see a long queue and when i asked the concierge if there was an express checkout or box to deposit our room key he told me that no i would have to go to reception to check out i joined the queue but then spotted the box in the foyer where i quickly deposited my room key i felt slightly disappointed that a concierge would not know that he had an express check out in his own foyer
