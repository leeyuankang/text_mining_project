the room was the tiniest room i have ever seen and had zero view over looked the back air conditioning units i have stayed in hotels with bathrooms bigger than this room it was also right next to the service elevator and door so there was staff going up and down past my room all day shouting at each other also they decided to paint the halls one day without warning the chemical smell woke me up and gave me a migraine headache it was not good value for the price i paid even though i had apparently got a great deal i would have moved to another hotel if i had to pay full price for that room
