i booked rooms for my wife and me and for our friends we paid very much so our expectations where high me and my wife got a decent room but not better than it should for the price however our friends first got a really small room that shouldn t be given to anybody for that kind of price it was really small and poor looking they complained and got a new room but still it was small and the double bed was cm that is not acceptable for for a price over pounds per night even for us which were upgraded it was not good enough for that price with this kind of worn out hotell prices should be considerably lower its a shame for what i thought was a radisson standard this hotell has teared down my imagine of a radisson minimum standard because it was really far away from my perceptions
