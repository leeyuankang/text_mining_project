the usual london experience of a tiny room with a tiny bed but well laid out and so quite manageable there s a bit of traffic noise but quite minimal at night only one tiny lift again not unexpected for a london hotel had the irritating modern bar fridge where you get charged if you so much as touch any product so you can t use it to store your own stuff
