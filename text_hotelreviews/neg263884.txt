we booked this hotel thorough booking com for one night as we had a show booked in london s westend after a lot of research we chose this hotel on the reviews left by other customers we paid over for one night in what was described as a deluxe king room on arrival it was nothing like the description there was a mild unpleasant odour the room was very small the carpet was stained the paint above the tiny bathroom was peeling away and the view wasn t great the room was very tired and dated i was very disappointed my partner decided we had nothing to loose to so he expressed our views to the lady on reception she really delivered she upgraded us to the edwardian across the road at no extra cost this room was just what i had expected from the description and reviews i had read previous to booking the original was by no way value for money or as expected we were happy with the upgraded room but would not be recommending the kenilworth due to value for money and the tired room
