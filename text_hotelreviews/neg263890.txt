the double room we originally booked was absolutely tiny it was like a walk in wardrobe we had to pay extra for a business room on the top floor which was what i would consider to be a normal sized room the photos on booking com are very misleading the mugs weren t replenished after our room was cleaned so we had to drink out of the cups in the bathroom there was dust floating around in the room and the leather headboard had splatter marks on it we weren t allowed to open the window the shower temperature kept fluctuating while my fiance was having a shower in the morning the lifts are very small and there aren t enough of them for the size of the building
