as mentioned on departure we had issues on sunday morning which we were not happy with the toilet would not flush and so was backing up the shower screen would not close properly so the water caused a huge puddle on the marble floor which was so dangerous and also just after the workmen started in the room next door lots of banging and chatting i appreciate they need to do their jobs but i do not appreciate such disturbances in such a plush hotel i appreciate that you upgraded us as it was my husbands birthday but i do not expect such things in a hotel with as high a reputation as yours had i paid for a holiday inn then maybe but i paid and therefore feel it needs to be mentioned i was promised that i would be contacted but i am still waiting
