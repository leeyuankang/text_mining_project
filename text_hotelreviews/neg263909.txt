the ensuite smelt of sewage and was unclean the room was very cold and had a huge draft blowing through the window room service was prompt but the food was absolutely terrible having arrived late with a child we ordered a pizza the was nothing short of a microwaved soggy supermarket pizza the smelt foul and tasted even worse although i didn t expect a great view the black air conditioning unit taking up the entire window covered in pigeon poo was not pleasant
