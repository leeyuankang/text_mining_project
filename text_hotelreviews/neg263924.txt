the night before i left home i received a phone call from the hotel saying that they had my booking but they didn t have a room i was shocked when i managed to regain my wits i protested that i had booked the hotel a month in advance and planned my whole time in london around the fact i could walk everywhere from the hotel he was planning to put me in another area entirely then he backed down and said i would have a room i m wondering now what s wrong with booking dot com don t they have enough clout to forbid such practices
