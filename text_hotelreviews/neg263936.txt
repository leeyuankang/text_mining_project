i could not be checked in earlier as requested as i arrived at having flown in at albeit that this was due to unavailability of a room at the time i was initially checked into a tiny room with no view and that did not have a safety deposit box as per my booking finally when i requested to be moved to a different room as per my order my laptop bag with the laptop inside was misplaced thankfully it was found with everything inside intact
