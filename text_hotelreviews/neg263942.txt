we booked into sister hotel i had requested non smoking rooms but all they had was smoking rooms we accepted it but when we got to the rooms the smell was disgusting we went to reception and they very kindly upgraded us to the sister hotel with two new rooms which were amazing i can t understand why smoking rooms are even allowed in hotels
