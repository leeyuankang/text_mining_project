the room service menu wasn t actually available when calling the front desk many of the options were not available it also seemed the person at front desk was making the sandwich and not dedicated kitchen staff it took him mins to go to the kitchen to check supplies and then another mins to ring me to tell me what he didn t have i was pretty disappointed at that
