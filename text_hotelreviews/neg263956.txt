staff variable one nigerian guy particularly rude maybe doesn t know better but otherwise ok they have this bad habit of ringing the room door bell which is very loud at around pm to check on the room i just happened to be snoozing and they rang the bell and immediately opened the door whist i was in my birthday suit they scared the living daylights out of me really a not needed service expensive even considering location
