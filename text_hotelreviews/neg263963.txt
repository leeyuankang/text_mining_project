we booked a wheelchair accessible room and the room we were allocated we could not even get the wheelchair into the concierge realised i think as he showed up with keys to an alternative room this was big enough to accomodate the wheelchair nicely the problem was that the floor in the bathroom was tiled and exceedingly slippy totally unsuitable for my disabled husband to shower safely and no grab rails i ended up having to put towels on the floor so he could walk to the carpeted area to get dried which was not ideal for accessible rooms these things are essential the lift was also really small and tight to fit a wheelchair and additional person and baggage
