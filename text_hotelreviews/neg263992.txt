we were in london to celebrate out anniversary and had booked this hotel for its location when we arrived to check in we were told that they had overbooked hoping for cancellations and had no room for us they offered us a smoking room which we said we would look at but as soon as we opened the door the smell of smoke and cigarettes was overwhelming we went back downstairs and were told they had no other rooms for us no upgrades were offered and we were shipped off to another of their hotels up by euston station given that we had planned to walk a lot while there we ended up spending more than we had planned as we were too far away to walk and had to take the tube the room we were given at the grafton hotel was ok but the window did not shut so there was a lot of boose from the air conditioning on the adjacent building and people shouting late at night and early morning
