i was looking forward to staying here but was shocked to be given a box room which was smaller than my bathroom that was all they had left apparently we were moved to the radisson hampshire hotel but had to complain there was a strong smell in the room of sewerage it was just awful we were moved again to a room with king size bed which was disappointing as i wanted a twin room the staff were helpful but i wouldn t stay at either of these hotels again we weren t the only guests being moved there were other couples in front of us all having problems
