this hotel is supposed to be a accommodation however given our experience it can be said it s no more than we booked a deluxe twin room with twin beds when we arrived there we got a twin room with one bed we told the front desk about this they reacted very customer unfriendly and told us there was no such thing like a twin room with two twin beds they also said that this was not their responsibility and that we should have booked from their own site and not with booking com because the information on their own site is supposedly correct we were very upset about their reaction and wanted to cancel the booking but the booking was already paid for and they said that we were free to go but they would not give our money back first they offered us to look for a room type we wanted in one of their other park hotels when we asked them to do this they took a step back and said that they would charge us extra for this so we had to accept the room anyhow they also said that they were fully booked and there was no other room available however on every online hotel site there was the possibility to book an room on the same day more interestingly we made the booking in euros and were charged more than euros more than our initial booking without any explanation when we were settled in the room it seemed to us the room was very cold and that the heater did not work the heater was blowing cold air even that we set it on maximum heat temperature remarkably we discovered an electrical heating unit in the closet when we called the reception that the heater did not work they first said it was working ok and that we would have to wait to heat up that did not happen the room was only getting colder because the blower just blew cold air mid januari in london that is not nice we called again and finally somebody came and said there was indeed a malfunction however they told us not being able to repair it until next day
