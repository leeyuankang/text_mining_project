hi ive stayed here many times but this last time was awful i ended up staying in room which proved to be a nightmare due to outside noises that started from the noise was so bad that i couldn t sleep and had to change rooms during the early hours of the morning imagine roaming the halls of a hotel in your sleepwear to find a new room and i wasn t offered any apologies at all which was disappointing
