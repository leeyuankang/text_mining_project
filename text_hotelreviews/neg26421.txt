i requested a accessible room for my mum and was given a room located by the lifts however we were given a shower over a bath which wasn t ideal staff aren t really friendly and especially in chinese restaurant where i was made to feel uncomfortable about the putting the bill on my room and was given the gluten free menu but items weren t gluten free and when i informed the staff of this they said it needed updating this is very bad and could result in someone being very ill also found the prices very expensive with a small bottle of water charged at
