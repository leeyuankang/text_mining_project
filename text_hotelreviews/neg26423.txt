after the extravagant entrance lobby and the high ceilings on each level you reach your room to realise that it is average at best with modern hotels putting there bathrooms before the bedroom thus allowing for a sound barrier from the hall to the sleeping area reducing noise pollution this is not the case at the grosvenor your bed is feet from the door and the noise of the hallway the grand original sash windows single glazed which looked great but provide no protection from the noise of the city below with the sounds as if the window where open at times the bathroom is small with an even smaller narrow corridor to get to it the shower in the bathroom is set over a narrow bath and to get the full affect of the shower head a person has to stand with one foot on the bend of the bath and lean in where it starts to curve really no need for baths on these premises i would opt for a walk in shower which would give more space lastly the television in the room had very poor signal and picture the channel list set on the television by the grosvenor which lets you know which channel to expect with each number has several channels that are not available as advertised
