we had to wait an hour for our room was not ready though we turned up half an hour after the check in time though the guest relations officer offered us free breakfast for our stay in lieu the room allotted was dingy and musty my son who is allergic to dust started coughing immediately overall the staff had smiles on their faces but didn t seem particularly interested in us or maybe they were too busy looking after other guests i would not rate this place value for money i would rate it one star for the convenient location
