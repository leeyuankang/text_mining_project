on arrival was given a double room that was actually single beds pushed together which inevitably separated constantly after complaining was moved to a real double room like a lot of uk hotels the quality of the room does not come close to those of a similar price overseas the in room tv choice is appalling and there was no tv remote control in the room until requested the bed was comfy but the provided pillows are next to useless the shower was distinctly average and housed in an overly small bathroom overall i have had far better rooms in less costly hotels and i would be reluctant to to recommend this hotel
