the room that we found on line and booked was not the room we ended up getting once we arrived we found a room with a couch and that s what we booked and once we arrived they switched our room and there was only room for people instead of we had to book another with additional cost which we were not expecting the hotel did discount the room at a cheeper rate but felt that the web page information was misleading
