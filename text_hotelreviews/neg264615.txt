my room was too small for my taste i was especially displeased by the fact that i was woken up almost every morning either by the noise from other rooms or by the noise of what i believe to have been a garbage truck around so this is a star hotel i believe but last time i stayed in paris i was in a star one and i liked it more as my room was very quiet
