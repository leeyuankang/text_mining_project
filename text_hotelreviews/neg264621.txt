there are really not many negatives about this hotel its a fantastic hotel my only issue is that this hotel is not really a four star if it was rated a star it would be the best star in town and customers would feel it was more accurately represented the public areas the front desk with single clerk and almost all aspects of rooms which are extremely basic don t really correspond with most of what is categorized star in europe granted paris standards can be very strange
