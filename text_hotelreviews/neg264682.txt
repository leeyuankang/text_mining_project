room was robbed on the last night and the staff were not very helpful they wouldn t allow us to watch the cctv footage from outside the room they are quite strict on who they let in so seems like the person who robbed us could have still been in the hotel but they didn t seem to care seemed slightly suspicious good access to trains and pool was nice at least
