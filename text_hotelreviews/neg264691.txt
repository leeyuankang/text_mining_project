when i was booking online the hotel stated it has air conditioning however on arrival i was saddened to find out that the air conditioning in fact is seasonal which was not stated on booking com as i suffer from severe medical conditions which is terminal it s partial for me to have a room which has air conditioning if the weather is too hot i immediately wanted to leave the hotel and stay in alternative hotel which has air conditioning however i was unable to obtain a refund at the time because the manager was on holiday and would not be returning till monday of april this was extremely inconvenient as i had to share a room with two other adults and had a balcony so that i can remain cool and not get sick
