on the first day at breakfast they had run out of hot food and didn t replace it the room was not as we had ordered it i had trouble when i went to pay and check out at reception they had no cash and the guy couldn t add up we also booked a taxi with reception explaining our needs but the reception messed it up badly which resulted in a double fare and delays getting to the airport for our flight home we ended up flagging a taxi down in the street this made things stressful and spoilt the end of our break
