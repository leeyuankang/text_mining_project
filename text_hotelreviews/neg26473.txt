only flaw was our experience in the executive lounge for happy hour we sat for minutes completely ignored we said hello to each of the two staff in the room and still received no service we walked out and back to our room i complained to the front desk they refunded the room upgrade and provided a bottle of red wine sent to the room as well as a bottle of juice for our son
