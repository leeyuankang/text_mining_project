some cleanliness issues signs unpolished dust and dirt in the stair wells which otherwise were spectacular the room was an executive king room at for nights the room was dirty dusty the coffee facilities hadn t been refilled the tv didn t work and we had to call reception several times to get somebody to do something as simple as change the remote the minibar was empty worst of all when staying ina high end hotel and paying a lot of money for a good room the bed should be good and as advertised a king size bed in our case the bed was single beds pushed together which we discovered when falling down the middle in the early hours very very poor situation made harder to rake when on checking in it was made apparent that the room scheduled to be ours wasn t ready so we d been moved downgraded to this other dirty room
