the room was not cleaned or serviced on our day no replenishment of used soap and shampoo make up spilt on floor was left where it was was our accident but it would be normal for this to be swept up when housekeeping serviced the room the bathroom was the smallest that i have ever seen just about room to stand between shower and basin to wash but no room for a toilet that was in a very claustrophobic closet on the opposite side of the bedroom with no hand washing facilities which is not ideal in the middle of the night or any time for that matter how this has stars is beyond me at best the neigbourhood seemed to be in the red light area with prostitutes lurking in every alleyway and sex shops and brothels on every block this may suit some but we will not be back hope this helps other find what they are looking for
