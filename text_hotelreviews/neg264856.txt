the breakfast is very expensive for what you get but the food is pretty good and there is decent variety but euros per person sure adds up the hotel room could have been a bit cleaner the carpet needed to be vacuumed around the baseboards better and the shower walls should be wiped down better the staff was polite enough but i feel like they were a bit short with us at times the neighborhood is a bit seedy there are prostitutes on the streets at night although they dont bother us and there are some erotica stores in the area and a strip club we never had any issues though
