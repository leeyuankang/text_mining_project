the checking in was shocking i had booked a large double bed for self and wife but was given two single beds i rejected that offer the next event or non event was horrible i requested for a wake up call for on thursday the by speaking with the telephone operator the call never came at about am somebody called the room to check if our wake up call was honored that was minutes before we checked out for the airport if i had not woken up spontaneously at am we would have missed our flight that was a really shocking experience the worst i have experienced in all my travels across four continents the service staff need more training many of those at the concierge barely spoke or understood english three of them in succession did not know how to check from an airline if flight re confirmation was necessary i had to teach one of them what to do i have stayed in the melia on and off since the quality of service has declined and my most recent stay was the least enjoyed
