hotel is quite large and daunting at first with an odd though reasonably successful lift operating process the large bed left the floor area at its foot a bit tight single file only the electrics though of high standard were a bit worn queues at reception were a bit frustrating when checking out although the guest experience worker did his best to ease things along sorting bag storage etc only minor quibbles on what was a generally good stay
