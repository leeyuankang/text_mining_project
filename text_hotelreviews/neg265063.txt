the twin room we booked twin beds is very small even by european standards given the price we paid approx us a night i booked this hotel because it was advertised as having air conditioning in fact the unit blew only warm air when i called to ask that the unit be serviced i was told that that was just how their air conditioning worked and was asked if i would like a fan to which i said yes sure enough i looked out my window and saw that every other room in the hotel had open windows suggesting that no one really had air conditioning after waiting and hour for a fan i called back to reception desk i was told that the staff member to whom i spoke was mistaken they did not have fans for guests
