had buffet dinner on the friday night and was having to wait for food chicken had to be served but no staff were about to do it then no potatoes or chips ready to have with meat overall quite disappointed and thought breakfast was going to be an ordeal but in the morning there was plenty of staff running around attending to the multiple choices much more impressed but all in all we did enjoy our stay
