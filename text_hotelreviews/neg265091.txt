mixed up reservation long process to find my booking upon arrival my first and last name were typed into one word therefore none of them found unnecessary disturbing calls from reception like somebody left something there can you find it or may we come and check your minibar now despite the calls no proper refill in minibar some items refilled some are not no change of shampoo shoeshine etc for the day of stay very small room one can hardly move between beds and walls noise and cigarette smoke at dawn from the neighboring rooms via vents and walls no proper ventilation in the very small toilet smells for half a day
