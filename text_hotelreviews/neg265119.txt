the service charge for two bottles of lemonade from the bar when all the bar man did was walk to the fridge take the bottles out open them and then hand them to me i was not sat at a table there was no service provided he was just doing his job i don t pay him to do his job the hotel does had he served me at a table i would have given him a tip as i do at every table with good service the bar man was not rude he was quite nice and polite so it s nothing against him the fact that it was just added to my bill with no notice is why i was annoyed two bottles of lemonade for is extortionate even by london standards
