the rooms are filthy the hotel is old very old the first room smelled and was next to the elevator shaft so all night up and down elevator sounds and this even though we requested a quiet room as an offered option at booking the room was just plain gross it smelled like an old sailor s shoes and we had to remove someone else hair from the shower drain the sink was dirty this hotel was disgusting don t buy into their executive access ploy all the rooms are the same unless you pay more for a suite the concierge was rude to my wife when she asked about having take out delivered to the room don t bother move on
