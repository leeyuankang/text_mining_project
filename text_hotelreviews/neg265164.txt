they took ages to find my booking typed in wrongly by them sent me to a room with cases in it no bathrobe which was part of the deal no room service menu and tho told by reception i could order from the restaurant menu no sign of it either and the wifi connection wasn t robust till i called up about it smiley good natured staff don t make up for so many basics not in place i lost an hour of my time getting all this sorted so unlikely to consider this hotel again
