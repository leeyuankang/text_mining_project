the check in process took for ages mins some members of staff in my opinion were also rude i must stress miguel was the exception he was extremely polite and most helpful throughout my stay the room turn down was very poor failed to replenish coffee and tea supplies and only a half used toilet role was added on my second day the size of the bath is also a joke all my stays across london i have never seen such a minature bathroom literally steps in and your against the sink also the mini bar had thick black dirt food around the door hinges
