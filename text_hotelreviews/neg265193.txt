reception staff were uncooperative as we have booked through booking com a superior double room and we got a small room with one bed they charged us more to move us to what should have been what we booked this is not the first time this happens with a booking com reservation listening to the staff at the reception desk they were doing the same thing with all the guest saying this is what you booked and you have to pay more i was upset because he first said you booked a standard room and this is a standard room when i showed him the booking and that it is for a superior room he changed his words and said i mean superior i had the same exact experience in catalonia hotel in madrid and had to pay more to move to a normal room
