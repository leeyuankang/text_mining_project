the rooms in the wing are really far from the lobby some of the elevators weren t working and it was difficult to get oriented in all those stairs and corridors in the building the heating system was broken in our room and we were freezing the first night and cold other nights even though we were provided emergency heater it wasn t our first time in the grosvenor but we used to go there to rest and have a great time this time it was really disappointing and we will reconsider our next visit this time it was very poor value for money
