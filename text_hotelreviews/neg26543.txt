for gbp per night this hotel is totally out of step with its peers the decor is tired old fashioned and dated low quality bed linens pillows and duvet scratchy hard cottons and no feathered duvet just those thick cotton fillings that sit rigidly above your body and do not fall around you very loud rattling noise from the air conditioning unit and since the windows don t open no option but to keep it switched on so your choice therefore is to bake in a boiling hot room and not sleep or have the air con on and struggle to sleep above the noise breakfast is nothing to write home about and served in a rather dingy room though again the christmas decorations at least were nicely done it is winter and yet only thin towel each provided in the bathroom and no bathrobes we were moved to a suite for our second night and yet sadly even in there the decor was terribly dull it was such a poor use of space as well a large living room with a sofa two armchairs coffee table and a cupboard in it simply no atmosphere at all for an extra gbp a night we could have stayed somewhere like hazlitts or the w which is where we usually stay and stayed here only for ease of connection to victoria gatwick we will never stay here again
