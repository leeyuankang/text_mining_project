just about everything the room was advertised as double deluxe but was tiny there was only inches between the bed and the walls hardly any surface space two people would find it completely unmanageable even one average size man would not be comfortable i arrived at hours just wanted a cup of tea and sleep kettle not working minutes phone calls later a very rude staff person arrived with a pot of hot water i had to argue for a working kettle hardly an extra in a star hotel was offered a marginally larger room but the view was bleak and depressing wifi slow and annoying had to access through hotel portal every time and often restart computer housekeeping poor no soap one day no biscuits the next insufficient milk room not vacuumed air conditioning had a rattling noise specifically asked for london black cab to airport and got company car instead definitely not value for money
