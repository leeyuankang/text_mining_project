reception staff not very helpful we weren t given any information on the hotel not told about restaurants meal times whether we had breakfast included despite confirming on check in it was first time staying there we were handed a key card and that was it we assumed our room would be on floor but the rooms only go as far as asked housekeeping staff where the room was he didn t know either asked another staff member who also didn t know but checked with someone who told us it was on the floor we discovered by chance an entrance from the train station into hotel another feature not pointed out on arrival lifts slow room small tv reception not great expected more for the price and star rating especially as the hotel was recommended
