the cleanliness the tray of in room snacks not sure when it was last wiped down the dust splash stains on the curtain near the coffee machine design wise the sinks are stylish but so impractical everything just ends up drying sticking to the basin as there is no slope so that everything can easily run down the drain hole lots of stain marks scratches around the whole basin too i think a refurb is needed the bath robes did not smell freshly laundered i think they had been worn re hung on the hanger without being washed lastly i find it strange that bath robes are supplied but no slippers especially when the floor is hard wood
