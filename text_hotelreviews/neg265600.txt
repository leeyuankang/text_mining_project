we thoroughly enjoyed our stay but there were a few niggles there was a muddle about cleaning our room one day also we were there for four nights but the sheets weren t changed there were marks on the walls and the lights were frustrating they never stayed on in the shower wc unless you kept pressing otherwise it was fine
