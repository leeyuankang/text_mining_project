tried to get us to buy vouchers for breakfast for next day preferred to add to our bill if breakfast needed at the time told this was acceptable and just to give room number and sign at the time advised in front of other diners that we couldn t have breakfast as we didn t have a voucher after we advised that it had been agreed the day before they agreed to accept room number and signature not happy with situation at the time and vouchers for breakfast seem cheap and tacky approach for a hotel
