the room is kinda small comparing to the pictures i saw online light didn t work at the shower and bathroom however the reception staff tried their best to fix it they offered a move to another room but i was checking out the next day so they offered a late checkout the noises coming from izakaya restaurant is kinda annoying as it stays out till late but overall it wasn t a bad experience it s a good hotel in general i just had a bad luck during my stay
