we loved being half a mile from the congested part of the city this location is close to the museums but also quirky streets with lovely restaurants and cafes delicious coffee fruit and flower markets the restaurant is very popular and a little noisy but all that stops at on the dot we happened to be staying in the ground floor room closest to the noise however i loved having a bathtub we will stay here again the service staff is fabulous
