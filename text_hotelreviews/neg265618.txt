so this was our second time staying at sir albert and i must say that we had a completely diferent experience this time by my own mistake i chose a smaller room than the last time and we noticed some diferences that really impacted in our opinion of the hotel the room was so small that we couldn t pull our medium sized suitcase past the entrance we had to carry it to the other side of the room and don t ask me how we walked around the cleaniness of the room was also really lacking the room didn t have the courtesy water skimping on water is just sad and other minor details overall i think that this is still a good hotel but if you have a look around you can find better rooms in the same price range
