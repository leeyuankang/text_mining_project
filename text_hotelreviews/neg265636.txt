all facilities were unavailable during our stay due to cleaning renovating so the amazing study and restaurant were closed with absolutely no mention or notice given to us the service was terrible i ordered a bottle of prosseco to the room bit they didn t have any ice and said they couldn t get any so i could only have it warm which i obviously refused i would suggest to anyone wanting to stay here to save themselves the money and go elsewhere as this ruined by partners birthday also asked the receptionist about the city spa mentioned on the website and they had no idea what i was talking about
