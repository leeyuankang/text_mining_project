found the corridors very drak and dreary didn t like the idea of the shower room with the sink in the bedroom nowhere to put towel in shower so had to come out into the bedroom to get towel just as well i was sharing with a very good friend no privacy from shower room to bedroom we were floors up and the base from the music in restaurant kept is awake for a long time
