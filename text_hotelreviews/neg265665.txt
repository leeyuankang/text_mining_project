no hour room service that was very disappointing the regular room service closing at pm wasn t so good anyway and very slow hour wait for a burger which came from an outside burger place not from the hotel s restaurant the window in the room couldn t be opened and the ac warm or cold makes the room dusty mini bar items a bit too pricey
