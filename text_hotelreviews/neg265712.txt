i didnt like the pillows very big and uncomfortable though we asked for feather pillows but not of good quality the houskeeping needs a lot of improvement the overall cleanliness is bad i m a hotelier and i know wbat im talking about i felt there is no value for money we paid a very high price plus city tax for nights and the room that was allocated for us wasnt with a nice view it was overlooking backyard though hotel had availability i used to check booking com it would have been nice to have a room with nice view during our stay nights
