on the first sunday of every month there is a special event in the restaurant from pm with a live dj we didn t know and found it difficult to relax in our room during that time as the bass was thumping through the house the room was comfortable if a little cosy no ensuite bathroom pillows a little too big to sleep on can t open a window so depend on air con so you have a whirring sound all night i prefer the breakfast to be included in a star hotel
