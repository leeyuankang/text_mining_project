this hotel is not very traditional as it look from outside inside is very modern but maybe too modern with interesting setting of room facilities wc shower sink all separated etc i found it not convenient i am as young as the restaurant izakaya was really expensive with small portion of food the atmosphere would be plus for the place but only if you like the posh style nicely dressed people overall i didn t like the too much fancy posh atmosphere
