everything about this hotel is fantastic except the noise if you are staying in a room above the restaurant do not expect to sleep could still hear it when moved two floors above it but managed to sleep it s ridiculously loud and therefore only renders this hotel feasible if you are going to amsterdam to party if not stay somewhere else
