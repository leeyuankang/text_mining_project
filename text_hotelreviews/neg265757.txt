style over substance at front desk although i d emailed called prior to arrival re twin beds there was no reference made to it by desk staff when checking in no note made on system general lack of clarity around my alternative options bigger bed bigger room etc ended up upgrading by my own initiative after checking in my other friends had total fiasco re room as they d been offered a twin but upon arrival none available all v messy no one knew who to blame staff v uninformed manager had to be called finally additional room offered but bad way to start a short city break holiday
