noise i didn t understand corridor music being played from i could hear it and it kept me from sleeping in i wanted rest should kick in from to be fair i asked for quiet room and was put on floor at the front and could hear trams and traffic they moved us to a room opposite the lift hallway carpet a bit tired now and raised in areas so tripped up room service has to come from neighbouring burger bar limited on choice although very nice quality hotel restaurant is sushi so again a required taste rather than choices but it s always busy just not my cuisine
