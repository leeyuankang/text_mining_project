my busband gregory iverson and i have been staying there since and the only fault we can find is that we like to read in bed and the lighting in the rooms is not conducive to that the last time we both stayed in august the staff very kindly located a lamp and extension cord but it was very awkward we are staying again on nov and if you could arrange something it would be greatly appreciated
