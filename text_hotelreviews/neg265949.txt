the central air conditioning of the hotel is ridiculous the only cool place of the entire hotel is the breakfast room the lounge is more or less however corridors and rooms are above the acceptable temperature and there is no way to correct that we even changed rooms because the first one was so hot we were sweating by just standing inside the room it seemed like a dry sauna the other one was a little better but still way to hot above degree celsius with the ac set to maximum
