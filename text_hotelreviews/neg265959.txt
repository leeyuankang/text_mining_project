the so called free wi fi it was free if you were a member of hhonors which i am not or if you paid pounds day i stayed in many other locations in london and in hilton hotels in other countries this is the first time i heard of free wi fi with a daily payment there was supposed to be a newspaper delivered to my room but only in the morning of my departure did i observed the said papers in the hallway next to the elevator free for anyone to take one the minibar could not be opened but there was also a note of warning that if anything is moved from the minibar i ll have to pay for it so i left it well alone
