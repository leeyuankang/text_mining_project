breakfast on the saturday morning was a shambles we were in the dining room at not many people in at that time we did not get a drink until and my order for smoked haddock and poached egg did not arrive until that was after chasing up the staff about it in fairness the manager appeared to have no staff and when some did come on duty they did not know what they were doing the second day of our stay for breakfast was great and we were looked after very well we were however overcharged for the fish meal on both days when we came to pay our bill in that the extra charge for the fish was stated on the menu as being but only if you were on a breakfast inclusive rate which we were the overcharge was adjusted and taken off out bill
