i was initially put in room which stank of cigarette smoke and had no mattress topper so the bed was extremely hard it also had an odd layout staff quickly moved me to which was much better but unfortunately the bath wasn t clean with a layer of black mould all the way around the edge under the marble clearly hadn t been thoroughly cleaned in a while also no free water in the rooms it s only available to certain hilton honors guests which is a shame as a lot of hotels i stay at do offer this
