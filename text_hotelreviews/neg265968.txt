bathroom was large but despite paying for an upgrade the shower was in the bath this would not have been too bad but the bath was so high i was unable to get in and out of it without partner s assistance asked for candle wax to be removed from bedside chest on the first day it was still there when we left a week later there did not appear to have been any dusting done on the days we had room service the furniture was shabby we must have had the best outlook in london over nothing but service ducting high walls and the smell of bacon pervading our room maybe use another booking agent next time
