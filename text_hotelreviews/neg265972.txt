the wellness centre area is in a poor state of repair with bits of card board taped to the walls to cover up some problems the area around the pool needs repainted as there is a lot of rusty bits the changing rooms did not have nice toiletry dispensers or products which i would normally expect from this sort of hotel they were clean though
