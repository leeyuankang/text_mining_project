breakfast was disappointing for the price first breakfast the eggs were too over cooked to eat second day i ordered poached eggs which were amazing but had to wait ages for sausages bacon beans in fact waited doling that the food on our plates was cold by the time we sat down nobody offered us a hot drink on three seperate occasions either myself or my partner had to find staff to ask for a hot drink disappointing when you think how much it costs lifts were incredibly slow too
