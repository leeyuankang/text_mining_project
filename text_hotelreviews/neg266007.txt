the pool closes at i don t understand this most people would not be able to reach the hotel by that time whether from work or sightseeing seems like a waist the locker rooms and pool facilites are in desperate need of refurbishment another thing i was in a business meeting the last day and had to check out a few hours later than usual well the hotel staff kept calling the room non stop where my adolescent kids were waiting for me to come back i am sorry i call this harrassment meanwhile there are literally hundreds of rooms in this hotel at the end they did not hesitate to charge me the late check out fee despite the fact that they made those extra hours absolutely unbearable for my children the general manager of this hotel has not heard the last of me finally i booked partly because there is an executive lounge where you could get breakfast afternoon tea and snacks well the staff in the lounge is really unhelpful you have to get your own everything there is very little food all in all it s a good idea that is poorly executed
