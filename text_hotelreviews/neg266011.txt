room service minutes than promised i had to call twice to remind them when finally it arrived they spilled the wine over the food left the food dripping in the red wine in the room without a fork or a knife and promised to be back with another glass of wine which took another minutes food got cold they took it with them they would not charge me but in the morning i got to pay the bill anyway i paid the bill anyway after a discussion with the manager who asked me if he needed to take it off the bill never again poor service and bad management
