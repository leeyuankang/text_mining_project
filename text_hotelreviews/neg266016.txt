we had a room for adults and we had a kingsize bed and a bed a for a child so it was uncomfortable and we spoke to the reception staff and they could only offer that next time we book we ask for a sofa bed so we were very disappointed on the sleeping accommodation and thought we should have had a reduction in the rate of the room
