when we arrived there was no electric so we could not get to our rooms until after my husband had flown in from hong kong and just wanted a shower and to relax we were going out in the evening with friends and we had a table booked in london for so this gave us very little time to get ready also the next day we had friends who met us downstairs where we all ordered lunch from the menu our friends food arrived but ours never did we were told the cheese we had ordered was still frozen so we ordered again we waited minutes and in fact had to leave as we had theatre tickets and would be late if we waited any longer the room was disappointing as it was very small
