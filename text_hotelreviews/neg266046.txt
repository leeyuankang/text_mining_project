blood stained pillow spare sofa bed had no sheets clean pillows or cases or cover not well thought out at all the sofa bed was dirty looking when opened out by the time we arrived back to our room anfter the theatre and a drink st the bar it was so disappointing to see all of the above it was too late and we were too tired to sort it out so one of us kept on the floor only two bath sheets when there was three of us staying very disappointed reception gave us a small discount but we felt this was disrespectful having to mae one of us sleep on the floor when in fact none of us had a comfortable night we ended up all trying to sleep in the same bed but as there were blood stained pillows found in the sofa bed we did not even have enough pillows
