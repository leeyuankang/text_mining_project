we booked an executive room with a turn down service which didn t happen on our first night it was sorted by reception on the second night we used the executive breakfast room for our first breakfast but it was short on choices we used the homage breakfast room on the second day and it is far superior in every way if you have a choice do not use the executive breakfast
