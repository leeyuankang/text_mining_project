when arriving i was told that i was upgraded to a bigger room it turned out the bigger room was a disabled one with a basin at the height of my knees and a shower which had a very uncomfortable flooring also i was told credit card details are just taken for booking purposes but when i wanted to change the card to another one it turned out it was already charged to the first one and changing resulted in additional fees
