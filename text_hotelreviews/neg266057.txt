on arrival i was given two vouchers for an evening meal as we were a running a little late in the day i thought this would be a good option to catch up on some time i called and booked a table for thinking that hr was ample time for dinner on entering the restaurant i made it clear that we had a show to attend and needed to be out of the restaurant by and could we be quite hasty with the order we waited minutes before our order was taken and the a further minutes for our starter to arrive by the time the mains arrived we had no option but to rush our main course and skip having the dessert that we had paid for in the meal deal breakfast was pretty poor for the standard of the hotel and the price we paid we waited minutes for an offer of any hot drinks i approached a member of staff and requested a pot of tea for and pointed out to where we were sitting i also asked if there was any salt and pepper as there was none on our table the lady was very pleasant and explained should deal with my request straight away we proceeded with collection of the breakfast items on show after a further minutes with a cold breakfast in front ourselves a table of was shown to their table not far from us and within a few seconds were propositioned as to what beverages they would like in the mean time we were still left with no tea or salt and pepper by the time i had got the jist of what was going on the gentleman supplying the beverages had turned around and walked off at this point i decided to hunt down the salt and pepper and my wife tracked down the person responsible to supply us with the drinks some minutes later with my last fork full of breakfast in walks the lady with the items that i had originally requested the next morning at breakfast we were left hunting for cutlery and clean glasses for orange juice
