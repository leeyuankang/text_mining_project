the breakfast was so expensive we travelled with friends who had pre booked breakfast on arrival i asked to see how much breakfast was to add to the room and was told which we assumed was good value for the two of us no idea on why such a specific amount and then when we looked at the menu in the bedroom it say each our friends went down for the meal in the morning and we went to get some breakfast elsewhere which was for a full english right next door and they both said we would have been so upset and disappointed with the continental breakfast if we had have paid for it i do think that the price for the room was a little pricey in comparison to the room size when you compare it to a premier inn where there is much more room
