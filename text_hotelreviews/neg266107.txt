we asked for an early check in when we got there our room wasn t available an executive room would be available soon she even mentioned the room number so we decided to take and pay for an upgrade when we came back one hour later that one was not available at all finally hours later it finally was available at the normal check in of but we got another room when we said we were waiting for another room they mixed it up and then we got the upgraded room who was supossed to be available at noon so in fact we booked an upgrade because that room was available for an early check in but finally we didn t get an earlier check in furthermore every time there was a big line for the reception and every time we had to go in line again to ask if our room was ready the staff should have paid more attention to that we paid a lot of money for an executive room but the service at the reception was very disappointing
