the view i requested a quiet room with a nice view of london but maybe the two are mutually exclusive we were allocated a room on the th floor which was lovely quiet but the view was of the inner courtyard which is just walls of other bedroom windows however the lack of a view in no way detracted from the wonderful time we enjoyed
