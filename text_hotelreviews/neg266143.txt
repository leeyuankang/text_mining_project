the room had slight areas of mould within our bath and cupboards and the air conditioning was non operational at all during our stay the robes had what seemed to be food stains over the back of them so we felt slightly off put and moved them to bottom of cupboard we were not told we were required to pay a deposit upon our arrival until the last minute of the check in even though they possessed my card details from my booking and we were not told it would take up to days for this to be refunded back to my account after being told minutes earlier it would be returned immediately the staff upon entry seemed welcoming and professional but a young lady had an appalling attitude towards her breakfast shift being extremely moody when offering us tea and coffee tutting as she walked away taking minutes to bring this too us nearly brought us too walking out and complaining too the reception we also overheard the supervisor telling the young girl to smile and seeing staff with their mobile phones hanging out of their pockets and checking them behind the curtain seemed unprofessional when seen by guests they continued to look a room attendant appeared early and as both my partner and i were showering and getting ready she proceeded to walk in after we said no thank you are they not aware of when we check out we felt these errors we found were poor from a hotel of this calibre and a gesture should be offered to guests who ve had an experience like this i felt the need to not complain in front of my other half as it was for her birthday i hope management take notice of these errors make the amendments for future guests who choose the whaldorf for a good experience
