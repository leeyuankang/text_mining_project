the executive room was no different to a standard room requested a walk in shower as my wife is disabled got a bath which meant my wife couldn t get in and out of the shower on her own very disappointing as we know they have executive rooms with walk in showers had the afternoon tea and have to say this is the only london hotel that we have never been offered a refill of our champagne food or tea had afternoon tea in other venues in london and always been given extras free of charge
