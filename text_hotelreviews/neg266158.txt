the room was very small for the price there was not enough shower gel shampoo etc for two people and not enough milk for more than one cup of tea each the dining room was pleasant but the food had clearly been sitting far too long in the dishes and was not great having stayed in london a lot we felt that it was poor value for money and disappointing
