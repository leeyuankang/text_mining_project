i booked a delux room for a single person for pounds the room was so tiny i was disgusted and embarrassed for that big way making complaint to the hotel also its really bad that we had to make a disabled person take steps from the front of the hotel the ramp is located on the other side of the hotel really embarrassing and equality for disable people is not met or at least is made very difficult
