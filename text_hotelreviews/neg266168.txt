the staff do not make you feel that welcome and they are just going through the motions the odd person had alittle more personality but some of the staff on reception whose english was more limited seemed to usethis as an excuse not to engage that much with the customer and were not particularly friendly booked two superior doubles tiny rooms and beds uncomfortable object to being charged for wifi why it is a free service on our local buses in cafes and evenn our local hospital in communal areas with the amount that is charged find this totally unreasonable and have since paid less to stay elsewhere with higher scores in all sections and free wi fi
