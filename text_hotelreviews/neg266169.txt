for a brand like waldorf many things could should have been better the room in booking was called king executive yet it had a queen bed and they said the title didn t imply a king bed the second room had things like the shower knob broken the bed sheets ripped the response time for simple requests or food was very long frankly a bit disappointed by the whole experience
