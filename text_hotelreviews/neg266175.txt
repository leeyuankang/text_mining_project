this is an old building with limitations the reception is not as glamourous as at some hotels and the dining room is limited by architectural features meaning tables are slightly sardined around the edges the route through to the restaurant is rather dingey the air conditioning was a bit noisy the bar was smaller than i was expecting but quite pleasant the fruit bar at breakfast was disappointing a lot of under ripe melon on offer and few gluten free options
