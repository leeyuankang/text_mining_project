music at breakfast was noisy not relaxing breakfast was ok but for the charge i would expect it to be freshly cooked i suspect that we paid over the odds i am sure that most of the other guests were on a deal at the hotel still a very nice hotel but would not stay again unless we were on some sort of promotion
