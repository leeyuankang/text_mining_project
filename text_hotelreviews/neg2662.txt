air conditioning wasn t great where the hairdryer was situated in our room was convenient for the mirror you had to perch at the top of the bed to dry your hair as you couldn t detach the hairdryer to move it to a more convenient plug the mirror pulled out an angle to the bed the mattress was smaller ones pushed together and this meant there was more bed stead than mattress and you found yourself walking into the sides of the bed all the time the shower door only opened half way which meant you had to manoeuvre between that and the towel rail on the right hand side which didn t leave much room whilst the style of the room was very nice the dark wood was very dark didn t like the fact i had to hand over photo id and the receptionist was unable to answer why when i asked only that it was hotel policy which is fine but why she took my credit card to confirm i was the one that made the booking my partner wasn t asked to show any id and what if i didn t have id would i not be allowed to check in despite me having pre paid the room not happy about this information being available hence why i requested the copy back on departure small bar facilities at the hotel with very limited choice of draught beverages
