only one lift working no signage informing of such but after of waiting it became pretty obvious there is a plaque stating that on this site london s lift was installed a synic might add it was still there o things break down i accept but perhaps a we are attending to this would have made the wait more enjoyable no porter facility available at point of booking in seemed somewhat characterless overall but this is a major city and that s not unheard of worldwide
