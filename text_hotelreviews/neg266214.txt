we paid for a room for three adults we got a double room with a single pull out bed it certainly was not for three adults two glasses two tea cups two dressing gowns we also paid for executive lounge access and this was a complete waste of money we asked when it closed and got told so decided to head up at twenty minutes later a member of staff said to fill our plates as the food was going nothing was mentioned about the drink going also however when we went to pour another drink we got a very snappy response that it had finished and that she had told us this the next morning for breakfast the lady at the desk had said it was busy and to go to the main restaurant we did to be stood in a queue with about thirty other folk in front of us we all felt the executive lounge was a complete waste of money the hotel is in a fantastic location but i believe that you d get more for your money in other hotels in the area
