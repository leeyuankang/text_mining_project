my flight was delayed hours and my room was cancelled despite having already paid the full fee up front the reception staff were not very pleasant or helpful in helping to resolve the issue eventually i was given a room but advised i could not access until after i should have been provided access straight away when i eventually got to my room it was barely big enough to swing a cat there was no drawers in the room to be able to unpack properly only a wardrobe was provided you cannot hang up socks overall not impressed and expected better from the hotel
