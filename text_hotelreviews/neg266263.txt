for the money this hotel costs i wasn t pleased at all and this is the first bad review i have ever given the room was clean but the bath leaked and had to use all the towels to stop it flooding the tv didn t work properly the radio switch in the bathroom has never been connected and top it all of the bed was massive but was so uncomfortable i know this is personal preference but i am easily pleased usually
