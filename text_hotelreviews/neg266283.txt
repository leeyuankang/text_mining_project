not up to standard expected room small and rather dark no full length mirror which seems remiss lifts not adequate for volume of guests and very slow swimming pool only open at weekends so very restricted to use breakfast rather noisy and chaotic with tables crammed close to each other reception busy and queues formed on checking out were informed we could have asked for mini fridge in room but no one told us on check in hotel bar small for size of hotel and did not feel relaxing or comfortable whole place could do wth facelift given iconic history of this london hotel
