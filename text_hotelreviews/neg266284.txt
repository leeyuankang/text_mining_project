the staff in the homage restaurant were not very helpful or even assertive the food for dinner was average and the breakfast that was served every morning was stone cold on the hot plates for a hilton hotel i would of expected breakfast made to order not sitting in the middle of the room to go cold also waiting minutes for a table at breakfast is totally unacceptable
