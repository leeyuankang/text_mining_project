the shower curtain in the shower was a bit short plus the spray was sideways on facing the narrower part of the shower shower when it might have been better at one end of the longer shower space and so taking a shower got the floor of the bathroom a bit drippy which i took care to dry up so as not to walk wet onto the carpetting of the room
