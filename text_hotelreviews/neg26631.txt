all of the rooms en suites have maserators connected to the plumbing including the toilet bath and wash hand basin the maserator makes the most horrendous noise which actually makes the whole room vibrate believe me i am not exaggerating in the slightest it happens when you drain any water from the basin bath or flush the toilet this noise goes on all night as other rooms use water i cannot believe they have installed such a system which must spoil everyone s stay breakfast was quite a shock i m not a stranger to staying in very many hotel grades of hotels from the very best to the worst the breakfast is self service this is quite common these days but they usually have cornflakes and weetabix not just muesli and rice crispies when i asked for weetabix they told me they don t serve it they had cranberry juice which was warm and when i asked if they had any chilled fruit juice they said put ice in it i asked for the sugar shaker to be filled as it was empty and he returned minutes later and i poured it over my muesli only to find he had filled it with salt he apologised and brought sachets of sugar on the servery no beans but hard fried rubber eggs plates so hot that nobody could hold them as there were no serviettes available i had to go to the bar to get some at the table no spoons the toaster required the bread to be put through times to get browned no butter for the toast all in all the very worst breakfast experience i ve had in years of staying at hotels this is not a cheap hotel but it felt like it very disappointed and i will never stay again and don t recommend it to anyone who values an unbroken nights sleep and a hearty breakfast
