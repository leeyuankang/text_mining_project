the room was absolutely tiny as was the bathroom manouvering from one side of the room to the other with two people was near impossible without one of us climbing onto the bed and for the price we paid was disappointing our stay didn t even include breakfast one of the evenings i rang room service times and no one answered the phone so in the end we gave up and went to bed hungry
