the staff was quite friendly and cooperative however when we arrived the reception was busy with one person and we had to wait for quite long time they have tiny waiting area which is across the big hall and is next to lifts after waiting for a while we heard noise and saw that security guys rushed to the person at the reception and pushed him out of the hotel hitting and screaming then i came to the reception and the clerk apologized for what has happened and said that in compensation for what we had to witness hotel will give us a better room superior instead of standard double but when we finally reached our room it appeared to be quite small i guess not more that square meters the room was quite narrow there was a double bed and distance from the bed to the walls was no more than a meter from each side which gave an impression of staying in a very narrow space however i had to hurry for an appointment and we accepted the room the breakfast next morning was quite good but same as in the most of the hotels i could not find any fresh vegetables just baked tomatoes it s quite surprising that in the middle of summer the buffet is full of cooked food but fresh vegetables and fruit are a rarity
