the room reeked of smoke when we complained the check in clerk tried to move us from an executive room to a regular room without any compensation we worked hard to save for splurging on an executive room and weren t going to let her downgrade us for something that wasn t our fault another clerk seemed to be upset with her trying to downgrade us but maybe our clerk was her superior so she wasn t able to do anything about it we refused to take the downgrade and left for the day when we came back to our surprise our room had been deep cleaned and all the soft furniture pillows and drapes had been replaced with new ones our room no longer smelled like smoke and we had a wonderful night stay there but then i accidentally forgot an expensive ring and i called as soon as i realized i left it behind i got the same crappy clerk and she told me my ring hadn t been found on our way back through london before coming back to the states i stopped in person to check if there was any chance my ring had been found luckily i didn t have to speak to ms craptastic again and my ring was returned to me i wish i had gotten her name because other than her everyone else who works here is fantastic she really needs to be let go because she is giving the hotel a bad rep
