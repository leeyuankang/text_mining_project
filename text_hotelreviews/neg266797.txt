the only main issue with this hotel is the location as it takes about half an hour on the tram to get to the center even if you re not looking to go to the center there s nothing really around this hotel as its placed pretty much on a main road the annoying thing is the two single duvets for the price you re paying and the quality of the hotel it needs to have a proper double duvet
