we had a great stay fast track checkin worked well for room but we had to do the other room in person this could be improved in the future we found that the staff member at the bazaar snack desk was too busy to sell food and tour tickets at the same time it would be better to have staff members to do this or have reception sell the tour tickets or even better have a concierge desk the restaurant staff needs to be more attentive for example bringing menus cutlery refilling water without having to be asked we like the late hours of the restaurant and hour coffee shop
