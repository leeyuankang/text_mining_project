breakfast was overpriced and of poor quality the massages in the spa were the same the location away from town would be ok if there was any food for dinner close to the hotel as there is not and the area can be slightly dodgy at night one is often confined to room service which is limited and not worth the money to top it all off the hidden fees including a euro fee to have the room service taken to your room were outrageous would not recommend
