the external door with the wheelchair sign displayed does not give any indication as to how it works i was travelling with a wheelchair user and ended up ignoring it in favour of the main revolving door the pedestrain ramp at the bottom would be better without the little step for wheelchair use a smooth transition on to the road would be better where one older or less able person is pushing someone for me it was not a struggle this i mentioned to the staff and they tok a note of it i booked a twin room when i arrived in i had to physically separate the beds not aproblem for me but i would prefer that it had been done again an older or less able bodied person would find this a struggle not to mention to potential for injuring themselves the light switches for the room behind the bed are not labelled in any way this means that one is turning lights on and off in order to find out which one is which a simple labeling would solve this where this causes a bigger problem is where one wants to not disturb the other person to read or get up and go to the bathroom etc the self checkout is very efficiant it does however list a miscellaneous charge it is actually i found out by asking a staff member the amsterdam city tax and thus i suggest should be written as such
