the restaurant was abismal staff were rude and ignorant didn t feel like we were treated as paying guests we were spoken to like riff raff just off the street a sign was up to say restaurant open at we waited half an hour until to just to be very rudely told that it actually wasn t open until the waiter was visibly looking down at us i felt like i wasn t really welcome there we reluctantly returned the next day after to grab a quick lunch which turned into a wait for a salad and a burger guests who came in after us were being served and there was food lying on the kitchen counter very much resembling a salad for over which was ready to be served when i questioned the wait on the food i received a rude response saying a group which had made a reservation at that morning were in so that s why there is a long wait first of all we were not made aware of this before ordering secondly if the group had made a reservation surely the staff should have been much more prepared for this thirdly just because there is a group of people who made a reservation that should not mean that people wont get their food for almost i was absolutely appalled by the service or lack there of it has completely put me off returning to this hotel and will be sure not to recommend to anyone
