menu in restaurant was very limited and there was nowhere else to eat within walking distance the room was cold it was set at c you could turn it up to by setting the temp and putting on the fan but that took hours staff would go in to your room and turn the fan off when you weren t there so when you got back would still be cold both myself and my partner got colds during our stay snacks and bottled drinks were very expensive for a bottle of water would not recommend this hotel
