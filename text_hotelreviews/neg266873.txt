the staff was very rude not welcoming and not helpful at all the restaurant was constantly closed for guests without any notice due to events whenever we asked the staff something we got a rude answer not looking for solutions the hotel itself is nice just very far away from the city and absolutely nothing around there however the staff ruined the stay
