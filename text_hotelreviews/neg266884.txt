the spa treatments and stuff from the bazaar i feel were a little overpriced the restaurant only sells burger meals and a few sides which was annoying because there wasn t that much variety if you wanted to stay in for dinner but the food itself wasn t bad the hotel is a bit far from city centre but easy to get to by tram the cleaners were quite annoying however would knock times before the afternoon to ask if we needed housekeeping and often would let themselves in apart from that it was a lovely stay and i would definitely recommend and hopefully be coming to stay again
