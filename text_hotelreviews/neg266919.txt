second time going went mainly for the spa we were not given towels dressing gown or slippers we were asked did we have swimwear as it was policy however when we went into spa everyone was naked this made us feel uncomfortable the pool was closed and the spa was unclean and messy other people in the spa were loud it wasnt relaxing we then had to dry ourselves off with toilet roll as there were no towels very disappointed as i had been to the spa a few months prior and it was fantastic
