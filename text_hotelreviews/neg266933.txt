service was spotty upon booking we had to wait around for a while before the receptionist realised i had to pay some extra city tax then upon leaving the guy who organised our taxi messed up the booking and we had to wait minutes location was a bit bland nothing to look at if scenic spots are your thing i d recommend elsewhere
