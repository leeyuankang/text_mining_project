it is a very high standard great hotel the price is totally worth it because it not exactly i m the city center but the public transport is convenient we enjoyed quite a lot even so there was some guy accusing himself hotel service that we never asked and used chip card came into our room that scared us the last night staying someone was knocking our door at very hard it was frightened we are lucky that we locked the door overall i think the hotel needs to strengthen the security and control the ppl who are not clients or even suspected employees nice spa offer
