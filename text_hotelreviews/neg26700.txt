although the food in the restaurant represented quite good value for london it appeared a little thrown together we sampled breakfast and dinner we returned a room service sandwich as there was no chicken in the chicken mayonnaise they did exchange it for another but it did underline the sloppy kitchen service not a fan of big screen televisions and pop music when trying to enjoy a meal in the restaurant as if the busy streets of london weren t enough excitement already it can get very busy and cramped immediately outside the hotel as there is a continuous flow of travellers often with suitcases exiting victoria station
