i chose this hotel for the gym and the pool the gym is small but adequate the pool which costs an extra euros to begin with though there was a special offer for now and which fact is not mentioned on the website at all is entirely unfit for swimming it is tiny which is something you might expect from a hotel but they are boasting square meters for the area so instead of a dozen different rooms of saunas and very costly massages it would have been a good idea to start with a somewhat larger pool i have swum in small hotel pools but this one is way too warm therefore there are people sitting in it chatting away using the whirlpool features so there is no room and absolutely no possibility to swim at other times it might be empty so there might be room and no whirlpool features but it would still be way too warm for swimming the hotel should lower the temperature cut the whirlpool features and put up a sign that this is a pool for swimmers or alternately it should describe this as a wellness area rather than a pool i came out of the area after minutes by the way no soap in the showers even though the cleaner had just left explained the above issue there and upstairs at reception no one thought of reimbursing me for a service which i paid for and which they failed to provide with no pool the hotel is too expensive
