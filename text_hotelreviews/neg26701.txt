the company computers were not able to get connected via wifi due to the security issues when i required help for that the receptionist said only not possible despite i needed a quick solution he insisted on not finding a solution it was very surprising and rude approach then i get connected via my cell phone which was actually the thing i wouldn t prefer after a while somebody came from it however i had already solved it out i didn t like the approach
