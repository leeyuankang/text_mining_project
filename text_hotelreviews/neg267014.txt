be aware you have to pay extra to use the spa we chose this hotel as we wanted somewhere with a pool so ended up further away from town for this reason we hadn t noticed anywhere on the website or on our confirmation that you in fact have to pay to use the spa area you also need to wear flip flops in the spa oh wait you can buy theirs for we always go to a spa hotel whenever we get to go away and this was the time we had to pay to use onsite spa at a spa hotel
