not the cleanest room i have ever been in but a long way from the worst bedside power fitting was broken and looked like it had been that way for some time stuffy room with no possibility to open a window the aircon was ok but was set to a standard temperature with only two degrees of variability either side permitted on the controls if you like to sleep with ambient fresh air in the room as i do then you may find this annoying it gave me a headache
