too many steps from the footpath to reception too far to walk to get to the rooms in the wing section only lifts taking you up to the floor in the main hotel then you have to walk to the wing section and take the wing lift to the floors above level in the wing the wing lift broke down so we had to take the stairs we were on the floor reception staff were not concerned about the lift situation and treated us with contempt we were told that they were aware of the problem a tech was working on it we were not permitted to use the service elevator whilst the wing lift was out of order we had to climb the stairs that was okay for us but if you were less ambulant or were disabled you wouldn t be able to access your room at all we were not offered any form of compensation for the inconvenience at all our room was extremely small and claustrophobic our bed was too soft and collapsed in the center so we were constantly rolling toward each other throughout the night as a result we had hardly any sleep at all extremely overpriced for what it had to offer
