no ramp leading up from the sidewalk to the reception area so we had to carry our suitcases up the steps a very long walk to the wing rooms only one set of lifts leading up to the floor from reception then you walk for a long time to the wing rooms room very hot but the air conditioner worked very well bed too soft so we tended to roll toward each other in the middle room very small but okay the door was extremely heavy to push open extremely overpriced for what was provided
