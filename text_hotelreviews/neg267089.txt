we did not appreciate the personel at all most of times it looked like they did not want to work for instance when we went to the spa of the hotel we were first asked if we had done a reservation if we were clients of the hotel and finally they said that it was a busy day and asked us we were sure we want to enter the spa once inside there were maximim people same case at the reception if you want friendly and helpful saff you are at the wrong place
