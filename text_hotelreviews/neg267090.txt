i didn t appreciate the disabled room as each time we had a shower the bathroom was flooded the room was too cold little or no choice of dairy free food or gluten free products for breakfast the worst was that a member of our staff couldn t travel and they told us at check in that they would have considered the no show in the final bill instead we endless up with the full bill nice
