parking costs are terrible euros a day i d recommend parking out on street much cheaper tvs are locked down so you can t connect your own tablet or similar to watch tv but luckily they have all the uk channels spa costs not included in core costs so not so much of a deal bit gutted as fancied a swim which is often included in other hotels the rest of the area around the hotel is a right dive currently being knocked down rebuilt and redesigned i m sure it ll be nice once complete but it ll take a while
