i had to wait for around mins for someone to take my order when i went for dinner twice on separate days in the restaurant located in the hotel the first time i did order the food after the wait but when this happened again the second time round after a few nights i left after waiting for mins without ordering food not sure if this wait is because i was alone or non european and so they didn t want or bother to serve me
