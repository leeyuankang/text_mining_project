i chose to stay here because it was close to business meetings that i was having but the local area has nothing in it with this in mind the hotel should offer some less expensive breakfast options euros when i want a tea and a slice of toast is ridiculous they also couldn t cope sometimes they couldn t see our booking when we first arrived they had a particularly busy night in the restaurant and left us waiting for an hour they lost some washing and recovered it always apologized and gave us some money off or free wine but it seemed a bit like the place had just opened and was suffering teething problems
