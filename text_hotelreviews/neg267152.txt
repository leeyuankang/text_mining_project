i didn t like the fact reception office was reduced to only front desks several self check in and check out machines nobody wanted to use because obviously people have always some questions to ask so in the result there was always a queue with long waiting time to be served i also didn t like how the taxis were arranged when the drivers made guests wait in the cold until they finish their chat
