wi fi in the room was unreliable we were constantly having to reconnect and log in the log in procedure was time consuming and frustrating the bathtub filled with water while showering it drained very slowly poorly the view from our window was poor we basically looked out from our floor window onto a bus depot and construction activity there is a bus stop right out in front of the hotel the area was always full of folks waiting on the bus which made moving along the sidewalk to and from the hotel difficult the area is also congested with folks going to from the train station bus depot and underground all of which are located right behind the property there was half eaten food in room service dishes in the hall just outside our door upon arriving they were still there the next day so we told the front desk the dishes were removed the next day a coffee cup from our room was left in the same location not by us it was still there in the hallway when we checked out days later
