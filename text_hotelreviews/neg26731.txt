the service at the hotel is horrible you can call housekeeping room service and reception and nobody is picking up for up to min after having called room service with no response for more than minutes i had to go to the reception myself as they were not picking up the phone as well after placing the order at the reception i got a cold and tasteless soup after minutes there were also other issues like not ordering an airport taxi despite knowing there are no taxis at the street sunday morning a long and nonexhaustive list of failures
