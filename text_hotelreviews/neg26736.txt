we paid for a executive room so we could use the lounge we found the lounge poor compared to other lounges we have used no vegetarian food on offer and when i asked if they could provide something was told no the complimentary wine under lock and key and have to keep asking if you would like a drink hardly anything on offer to eat and breakfast was poor we have used executive lounges at the marriott chain and at the millenium hotel in london and were far better and offered so much more they don t even offer nibbles such as nuts and crisps to have with your drinks just a jar of hazelnuts
