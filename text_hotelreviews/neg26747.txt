towel rail in bathroom was very hot to touch made the bathroom very warm after a shower the room itself was also very warm and although the air con was on it was too hot to sleep comfortably coffee selection could have been better all but one were the same flavour booked an afternoon tea as it was a very special occasion found the service in the beginning to be poor it appeared as though the staff had no idea of what i had booked i had also asked for a vegan option in advance and this appeared to have been forgotten all he got was sandwiches which were very nice i would suggest to offer maybe some fruit or something else to give a desert option
