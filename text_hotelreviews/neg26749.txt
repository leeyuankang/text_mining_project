breakfast was very poor i am not a fan of buffet style breakfast anyway but the food had obviously been out a while and was tepid so by the time you have your food and waited to get toast the food was cold the bacon was dry and shrivelled the mushroom a bit of a warm oily mess i sent it back to the kitchen to be warmed but it came back slightly warmer but the middle of the sausage was still cold ended up with a croissant and apple which wasn t worth the money i paid i think you should consider cooking a fresh plated breakfast for i would stay at the hotel again but i will go out for meals
