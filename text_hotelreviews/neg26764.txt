the room was appalling forget the pictures on the website the twin room was so small you couldn t swing a cat and housed in the wing accessed via two lifts and a route march all the hallmarks of a larger room that had been split into a smaller one to sweat the asset curtains fitted into the window recess and not the outside result light flooding in at any time this is a capital city hotel for goodness sake the lights never dim outside no room between the beds and very little down the sides a standard lamp in one corner that you walked into every time you walked around the beds an office chair that couldn t come out from under the desk because the foot of the bed was too close you entered the room and walked straight into the side of the wardrobe full entry required negotiating a dog leg movement a mini fridge housed in the wardrobe that couldn t be accessed unless you opened both wardrobe doors a life expired tv an en suite so small that the sink was an arm rest when sat on the lavatory the hotel was booked because my daughter was undertaking a theatre experience in the west end and in particular the apollo victoria theatre whilst the theatre experience was wonderful this room really took the shine off what an end to a hard working day sleeping in a rabbit hutch
