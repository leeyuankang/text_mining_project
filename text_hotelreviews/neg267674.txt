we wanted an accomodation with car parking opportunity and it was shown that there is however when we arrived they said that no parking place left and we had to go quite far with the car our room was not ready although we arrived after we had to wait almost hour the staff is not enough for this hotel it seemed at the delay of room cleaning no problem with the quality only with timing and also at breakfast they tried everything however more staff was needed
