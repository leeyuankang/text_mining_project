we were at this hotel three years ago and it was really good but this time everything has changed breakfast is complete chaos no cups tables not clean obviously understaffed you have to ask for soap toilet paper tissues and even teabags the quality is equivalent to a two star hotel or lower we visit vienna frequently but don t offer us this hotel again never again
