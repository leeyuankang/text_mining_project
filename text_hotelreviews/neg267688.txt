the only thing that bothered me was the kitchen smell that was present all over the main public of the hotel i mean it was bad so bad that after breakfast on sunday my clothes and my hair smelled of food it s a ventilation problem i think they should do something about it because the hotel is very nice but the smell of fried food is not a pleasant lobby perfume
