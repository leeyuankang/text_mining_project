the bathrooms have no hooks to hang used towels which was slightly inconvenient we also had some problems after our first night with the cleaner obviously not being aware of what their job entailed the hotel only opened three days earlier so i expect this will improve the big pillows in the beds are lovely for sitting up to read or watch tv but i would have welcomed smaller extra pillows for sleeping to be made available as well
