we had an early flight to catch so needed to leave at when breakfast begins at the weekend therefore we asked the receptionist if we could arrange something to take away or have a little earlier we appreciated this was an exception and were only hoping for maybe a couple of croissants or other breakfast items if the croissants weren t ready coffee and juice we spoke to the receptionist more than once to confirm this and arrange that we would come down at and sit in the lounge area to take breakfast rather than in the breakfast room unfortunately we were greeted with breakfast staff who did not know about these arrangements and told us breakfast was not open a few times after some debate they huffily conceded to fetch us some breakfast items the ridiculous thing was that the breakfast was already laid out like a bountiful banquet of pastries etc and we could see it through the glass doors but they wouldn t let us in there to pick a couple of things instead we had to awkwardly point through the glass whilst they picked things out they brought us out some drinks but then we had to send them back for milk and they brought us yoghurts without spoons the man was clearly cross about this taking up his time when he was supposed to be setting up breakfast so i don t know why he didn t just let us serve ourselves this was a really stressful start to the day and a disappointing end to the stay at this hotel we were on a tight timescale to leave for the airport so having our time wasted by waiting for someone to bring us things when they weren t prepared was really annoying
