having received a phone call from the hotel a few days before to say both the rooms i had booked had been upgraded to executive rooms we were all quite excited on arrival at the hotel we were allocated the two rooms was far superior to the other which was a big disappointment to me as we i ended up with the more basic room why call ahead and then change what you are offering
