had the feel of a rabbit warren should have more prominent signs for lifts and reception especially on the to floors could not see a map in my room on how to leave if a fire alarm was sounded if it was there it should have been prominent tv had poor sound quality and no teletext which i use a lot as i have a hearing problem so i use teletext for the news etc however i would certainly return and recommend the hotel excellent value and extremely helpful staff
