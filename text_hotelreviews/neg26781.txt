we booked as adults and children we would have expected the rooms to be next to eat other if interconnecting weren t available our rooms where several doors apart and opposite so it did not feel safe knowing my children were not close by i feel we should have been advised if this especially when the lady who phoned us the day before gave the impression that we had connecting room i would not rebook on this basis
