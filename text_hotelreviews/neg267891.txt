the staff is outstanding but the owner or manager does not take action hat is obviously required we had one of the better rooms there was a single bed to be used as a couch with added cushions for a back rest this lack of a comfortable place to sit is not what one pays for here it was made much worse by fact that the curtains behind the bed go to the floor and cannot be drawn unless the couch bed is away from the wall which means that when one leans back the cushions fall back thus one must sit as on the edge of a bed this has been a problem since the room was furnished perhaps a decade ago the staff tried but there is just not a solution short of a real couch if management is not willing to do this perhaps the curtains could be hemmed so that the bed does not block pulling them closed at night
