the room was on the top and i add always a kind of background noise most probably from some ac engine for me it was ok since i was extremely tired and i could sleep anyway but some people may not like it the facilities are very very old and need a urgent refurbishment the tv was a smart tv from the early s with a very very bad signal reception ok i was not there to watch tv but at least i would like to actually be able to watch a tv channel if i need want to if the mattress could speak she would probably tell you some good stories as it was old and used for good all these aspects are ok if you don t care too much or if we are dealing with a cheap hotel but i wasn t expecting this from a supposedly good brand i stayed in ibis and holiday inn much better than this for half of the price
