the few restaurant staff had disappointed me during my stay to during my first breakfast i found a cling film in my salmon parcel and mentioned it to the one of the staff i was not expecting much but a reassurance that the rest of the food had been prepared to the highest standard of safety and hygiene was expected in fact the same staff to whom i brought this attention to didn t even say a word let alone any apology on my last day of breakfast while i was still having my breakfast the staff just took away my cup without asking whether i had finished my breakfast not until i made a remark to my friend of what had happened then only the same staff brought over a cup also on that same morning over breakfast i was sitting on the table for two by the cutlery station on safety ground the staff could have stood further away from the myself the sitting guest rather than having tray of pots of coffee teas and dirty plates and cutlery over my shoulder and head i dread to think if any of them dropped those trays over me i could have suffered serious injury
