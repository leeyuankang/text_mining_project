the first night i was booked to a tiny double bedroom on the ground floor and unfortunately you could hear all night cars driving and pedestrians walking by also the room wasn t very good isolated and you could see the light from the corridor outside and the corridor door opening and shut also the housekeeping team must have had nearby their cleaning cupboards so from you heard loud voices and the vacuum cleaner going on the bathroom in this room was designed for a disabled wheel chair person which is ok but i felt it was a bit small and the shower was not warming up and the water pressures was low so it took ages to wash off soap etc however after i complained to the front staff about the noise and the water they put me in one of their club rooms which was better and the water pressure in the shower was good overall i stayed in the hotel for three nights and it was a good experience
