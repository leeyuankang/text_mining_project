my room was a little on the small side but that is london i found it easier to boil the kettle on the floor for tea as there was little room on the desk a hazard if you have small children but there was plenty of tea and coffee unlike many other hotels toiletries were sparse i took no soap and relied on the hotel to supply it i am sure the staff would willingly have supplied more if asked wifi occasionally signed me off
