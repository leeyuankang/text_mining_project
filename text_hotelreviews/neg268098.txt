the hotel and or booking com lied about the reservation and fortunately i had my laptop with me to show that booking com offers park deluxe rooms with a king size bed a twin bed when in fact the room has a two twin beds or a king size bed we were left with no choice but to accept a room with twin beds and a roll away bed for the price of the deluxe park room the second day the room was not made at in the afternoon and the answer from the receptionist to our request to know why it had not been made up was it is probably because housekeeping hasn t reached your room yet before we left six nights later the tv system went down and nobody could repair it it was repaired at on monday we think that at nearly a night this hotel could afford to have an engineer capable of repairing the system on site
