great location amazing suite upgrade but staff not up to speed at all at check in not really welcoming nobody taking care of our bags even at bel etage floor the used plates remained in the hall way for many hours whole day actually without being cleared door man more busy texting on his smart phone than being supportive having some very solid comparison of great places benefits from a great location and a greatly built place but it appeared that the hotel has got an overall staff problem
