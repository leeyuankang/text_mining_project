it is a really old hotel with old furniture and old beds the staff were rude and some of them waited for a drink the cleaning was not done well enough there were leftovers of waste from others who had stayed at the hotel see photo there was not internet in the rooms you should pay extra if you wanted this it is not at all a hilton hotel as you would expect
