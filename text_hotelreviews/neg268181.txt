over priced based on facilities and room condition it is really expensive while checked in my card was authorized with room price additional and on top of that they charged the room price i understand that amount will be released later but it seems you are paying more than double of ur room rate corridor carpet seems dirty and room looks old and renovated again overall it doesnt feel that you are staying in hilton
