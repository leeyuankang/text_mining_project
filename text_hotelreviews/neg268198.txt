the hotel manager was not helpful at all we booked a room for adults they sent us to a room with one bed so we went back to the front desk to ask for different accommodations and his answer was that is the way all our hilton hotel rooms are not true as we stay in hilton quite often we then asked for adjoining rooms as we were not all going to fit in one bed and although he did find one we had to make trips back from the elevator as the keys they made continued to not work we were very frustrated and the hotel manager never once apologised for their mistakes the bed in the main room was incredibly uncomfortable and the room was not clean dirty cups spoons and a partially opened coffee pack will be reporting this to corporate hilton as well no one should have to go through this frustrating experience while traveling
