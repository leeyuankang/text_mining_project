the room was much smaller than advertised or shown on pictures for this room type and it felt cramped to be honest we were quite disappointed since our main reason for chosing this hotel was the promised room size bathroom was also small and there were no bathrobes as promised everything was quite worn out with visible tears and spots in the wallpaper and curtains the carpet was not really clean the minibar was filthy the coffee cups were dusty etc all in all not good value for money and this is definitely not a five star hotel
