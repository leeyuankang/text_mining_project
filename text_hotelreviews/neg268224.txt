stayed in the junior suite facing the cathedral access to executive lounge but they putnme on the first floor so every time i opened a window ac does not work during winter months all i got was traffic noise first day was given a complimentary bottle of sparkling water which was never replaced the next day like all other hotels in the world they actually left the empty bottle sitting on my bedside cleaning staff never put the ironing board or iron away the tv faces the toilet and you have to lie diagonally on your bed to watch tv or turn your neck the two chairs for guests are useless and uncomfortable decor is terrible all brown shades of old wifi is not free scam and shameful i felt i was back in
