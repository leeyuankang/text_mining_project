i don t like to pay more for the internet surprisingly the net is available free anywhere in the city except inside the hotel which is only free in the lobby the rate of the hotel is high and i don t know why they put a charge for it anyway i ll be more careful next time when i choose a hotel for that hotel they will lose a lot while they are looking for a minimum
