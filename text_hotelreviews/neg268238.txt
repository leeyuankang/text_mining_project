the whole place feels tired and in desperate need of a refurbishment it looks like nothing has changed since it opened years ago when i first stayed there the carpets furniture and bathrooms are worn out scratched and damaged the internet is expensive and the breakfast hour to is often very crowded i only stay at the hotel because it is next door to my head office
