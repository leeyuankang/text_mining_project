this hotel would be lucky to be rated star anywhere other than europe all you get from the grumpy old doorman is a grunt when you arrive my room was dated with a tiny bathroom i enquired about a late checkout and was told they were fully booked on that day however when i checked online there were different room types available including mine never again for me
