reception staff are very rude not welcoming and not helpful at all we had an issue with having an extra bed in the room even though on booking com it was mentioned that child under years is free of charge they offered us another room but they asked us to pay why should we pay if there was a miscommunication between booking and the hotel room service staff were very unprofessional they used to enter the room even if we were there sleeping or getting ready it s very shocking that hilton is a star hotel but they don t have free wifi in the room again they ask to pay for it looks like all they value is money
