cleaner opened our room door at in the morning and wanted to enter the flat while we were still in bed room without proper knocking or being allowed to enter the check out time is which is being ignored i have complained to the concierge who just defended the lady saying they earn euros per room and have to do their job quickly i was expecting a lot more from hilton but won t book any room again with them in future paying euros a night for using a wifi in the room is ridiculous considering you can get free wifie in pretty much every cafe or street around also breakfast costs euros per day which is well overpriced you can get times better coffees and morning buns elsewhere for fraction of the cost
