so impersonal from the welcome to the checkout everything in between the take it or leave it attitude from the staff is so pervasive it s disappointing i quite often reside at a hilton enjoy the stay it s generally an upmarket quality chain not in this instance additionally the spa was not functioning properly wifi per day is a rip off even hilton honors guests pay this if they did not book directly with hilton meaning the fact that you stay there is not valued you are in fact penalized if you booked via expedia booking com etc ludicrous in essence too busy too uncaring a pity
