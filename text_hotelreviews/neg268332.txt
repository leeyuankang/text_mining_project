i spent over an hour at check in due to the longest queue i have ever encountered at a hotel check in desk i was told that this was due to a flight that had been cancelled and scores of people checking in at the same time still not a valid excuse this delay spoiled my evening dinner plans in such situations the hotel should bend over backwards to compensate by e g offering a free dinner or suchlike it certainly was not the best start to my stay
