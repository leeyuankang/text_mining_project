our room was one the few with really no view at all but looking to blind walls in our reservation some months ago we asked for some view apparently that was not used the shower temperature changes constantly from cold to hot and back really inconvenient booking via booking com makes that no hotel points are collected but even worse the staff does not recognise your status
