for vienna this is a comparatively new building so rather lacking in charm i was on the floor in a corner room which was decorated in all shades of yellow and orange rather overwhelming when the curtains were closed sound proofing is an issue the people upstairs clearly had small children who thundered around until past next door a cupboard door was allowed to rattle back into position with monotonous regularly until past midnight i hate any kind of noise but with the only alternative being to request a room transfer at midnight i pushed on through you need your room card to access the floors in the lift which confused a lot of people including me as it didn t work very well worst of all wifi is not free i am an hhonors member and thought that meant i got free wifi however when i rang hotel services to enquire i was told no that was not the case so the choice is either pay euros for each hours or go down to the lobby where it is free i opted for the lobby where i found myself surrounded by fellow users and one man making very loud international telephone calls not ideal if you are on business in this day and age charging for wifi is a blatant money making racket which lowered my opinion of this hotel considerably so i moved to le meridien for the rest of my holiday
