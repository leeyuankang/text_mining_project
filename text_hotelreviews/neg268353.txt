it is not a star hotel i have booked on a discounted rate but still it doesn t worth it the staff were pretty rude and i believe specially since i booked through booking and asked them if i will get points on my hhonors account they have treated me as a second class guest the bathroom needs a renovation even in executive floor the carpets are messy in the city that you have public fast free wifi in the middle of the city in museum quartier s huge open space it is a shame to charge for a pretty hard to get wifi i am sure that i wont stay in this hotel again unless it is heavily discounted again for the same price you have many other more interesting options in town unless the proximity to the train station to airport is a must for you
