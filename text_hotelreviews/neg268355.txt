the worst thing ever is when we chicked in there were no staff to take the bags and luggage to the rooms we had to take a troley by ourselves and take the bags to the rooms i think it is shame on hilton group for this to happen second there is no parking to park a car and if you need a parking you have to pay euro each day wich is tooooo expensive third for chick out we had to call the reception times to send someone to take the luggage and we had to wait mints and we were late to reach airport because of bad facilities the hotel has forth in chick out the staff told us there is an error in the system and we had to wait mints to chick out and we were in harry to reach the airport i dont recomend this hotel at all and i will not stay there again
