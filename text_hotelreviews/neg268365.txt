on the last third night of our stay there was extreme noise in the corridor from p m to a m the corridor was full of young boys and girls when i called the reception they said that there was a performance at the hotel and the room next to us were given to the performers young boys and girls they offered us to change our room at midnight however we did not accept as we would check out the next day this was really a bad experience on the last night of our stay the performance should have been organized such that the guests of the hotel would not have been affected or bothered
