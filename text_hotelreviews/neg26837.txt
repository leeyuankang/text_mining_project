wasn t much near the hotel so spent a fortune on taxis our breakfast menu for room service wasn t collected and when breakfast was late we realised the menu was still on the door when it did arrive after we phoned reception it was luke warm and no toast but appeared to have a lot of butter and jam in all fairness we did have a free bottle of wine sent to the room as an apology following morning we only had cup so had to take it in turns to have a drink breakfast room felt like a school room and not the ambience we expected i also don t like having my breakfast with a man sitting slightly above my eye level on a bar stool wearing shorts hairy legs are not appealing whilst eating i think the dress code should be no shorts didn t take a picture of our room view it was buildings and cranes
