the hotel was overcrowded we had to wait for the breakfast room to get a free table there were too many people around the foods the breakfast room was too small relative to the number of people having breakfast the choice was not as good as one would expect to be in a hilton hotel considering the overall quality the price was too high in vienna there are as good hotels or even better than this one on a much lower price
