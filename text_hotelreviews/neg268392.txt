i could not get a good nights sleep due to the heat of the room on any of the four nights there as the air conditioning was not available to turn on when i requested at reception that they send up a maintenance man to rectify this i was told it is autumn they suggested they would send someone up to turn off the unit completely and open the window i told them i had done this and that this did not solve the problem
