i couldn t find information about hotel facilities and restaurants etc in the room apart from the room service menu no questionnaire given by reception if there was i would have told them the taps etc were loose in my bathroom and the water whilst hot for the sink was not very hot in the bath or shower either at night or in the morning which was a bit disappointing
