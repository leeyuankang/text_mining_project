chaotic breakfast system as a solo traveler i found breakfast a stressful experience staff communication and efficiency were poor on the first morning my unfinished breakfast was cleared when i momentarily left my table in search of some jam the second morning after being shown to my table i went to queue for breakfast only to return and find my table had been allocated to other customers i expected better from this hotel on checking out i mentioned the chaotic breakfast system but the receptionist didn t seem interested i would not return
