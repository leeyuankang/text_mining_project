there was a problem with a sewage smell on the ground floor we were staying there so it was a little unpleasant which was too bad because the room itself was wonderful the smell was in the hallway and in the room but had nothing to do with our bathroom there were no problems with floors above the ground floor there are only two rooms on the ground floor so no worries for most bookers please note that we noticed throughout barcelona that suddenly there could be the same sewage smell especially the closer you get to the water in the city we really don t want to fault this great place for that just be aware about ground floor two rooms and ask about staying floor and above
