there is no sense of privacy or exclusivity in this hotel its bar and two restaurants in the lobby are open to the public and from morning till midnight the place is besieged by people of all sorts including those you d rather not see we were also surprised by the level of guests staying at the grosvenor some of them wore hoodies and a lot of them looked like from the eastenders even though we stayed at the junior suit it was tiny its air conditioning very unresponsive and some table lamps missed bulbs very long response to replace and what is it about spot lights they were glooming from the ceiling giving insufficient light in the evening they also made everyone look dreadful spotlights are for lighting up objects not people terrible atmosphere bad lighting impersonal furnishing and all this for more than gbp a night oh and location is nothing to write home about it only looks close to all the attractions on the map in reality it is a long long walk from anywhere attractive do not recommend
