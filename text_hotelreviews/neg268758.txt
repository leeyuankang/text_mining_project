the air conditioning in the room didn t work for heating so when we arrived it was in the room then maximum the guy at the reception was very helpful and gave us a heater for the night but our daughter in the next room also was cold so she took it and they didn t have another one the water in the shower was also very cold the first minutes so we had to wait the other thing i didn t like too much there s no view from the windows and the last one i didn t expect to be charged for our dog which is only kg weight it was the first hotel who charged us ever and we travelled a lot with it
