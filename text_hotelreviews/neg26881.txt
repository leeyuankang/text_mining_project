the only bad experience we had was the room service we order drinks to our room through room service whilst we got ready we were told it would be there in my wife said that was ridiculous and cancelled it and received back chat from the gentleman saying we re very busy you know later we got a call and were told the drinks were on their way later that evening ordered a couple of drinks and a burger which arrived after about which we were happy about however we wanted breakfast in bed and filled in the card of what we wanted and when we wanted it this wasn t complimentary we asked for our breakfast to arrive between by still hasn t arrived so my wife called room service and we were told it was on its way by still hasn t arrived so called reception to ask what was going on the lady apologiesed and said she had just been told it was on its way by i called room service to say i wanted to cancel my breakfast as we had plans and were going out the gentleman asked my room number i told him and he started shouting down the phone saying i have sent it it should be there we re not ones to complain but for a night i won t be spoken to like that didn t get breakfast but spoke to the manager and she cleared the other room service bills so rectified the issue
