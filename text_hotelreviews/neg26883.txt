the beds were really uncomfortable and there was very little hotel information in room tv was hard to turn on and i guessed the number for reception to call and ask for advise turned out that to turn it on you press any button on the remote just not the on off button so just some basic information in room that explains that kind of thing promotes the in house restaurants and other local services would have been helpful little things but would make a stay pleasanter
