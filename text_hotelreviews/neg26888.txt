the room we had looked a lot smaller compared to the website the location of our room was right above victoria station so all you could hear was the next station will be or something of the sort also the bar staff one man followed us out we had cocktails couldn t pay by card due to system failure in the area so we said we could pay on a tab they said that was fine we assumed this was already sorted with our room as we told them our room number and didn t need to do anything else therfore went to leave and got chased out saying we have not paid very embarrassing
