arrived to check in and had to go away and come back times before we could get in as room wasn t ready the receptionist disputed the fact if paid before arriving despite me showing lots of proof and didn t apologise later that she had got it wrong nowhere near enough milk or sugar for tea and coffee and powdered creamer room was serviced once through whole trip so wet towels last night and sat and no tea or coffee left no robes and towels were tiny not big enough to be bath towels for adults
