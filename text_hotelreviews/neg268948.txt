the room was tiny there was lots of dirt on the walls the window was broken so stuck slightly open permanently so i was woken constantly room is the room i was in they wouldnt let me check in till even though id paid for the day was at the hotel from tired from travelling and had to wait hours to enter my room which i was paying for the staff were really nice there is no way this hotel deserves stars the actual hotel was nice and the bar was great the actual rooms were horrible though location is superb
