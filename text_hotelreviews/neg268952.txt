it was hard to get a good nights sleep because of the location i have stopped in a hotel on rembrandt square twice before and have never had problems with sleeping but here i was woken up on the hour every hour by people outside and the trams the bed wasn t that comfy and there seemed to be a dip in the middle so i found myself rolling into the middle of the bed a lot housekeeping were reluctant to fill up the toilet paper and we ran out of toilet paper twice there was only soft pillow each on the bed i found another pillow in the wardrobe then the next day this had been removed from my bed by housekeeping on kings night our room was left open on the lock possibly by housekeeping as there was a housekeeping cart outside but no housekeeping members in site this was at at night so very odd we have no idea how long our room had been left open as reception told us they finished at so was a very weird situation reception seemed shocked by this but didn t do much and just said they would pass our comments on to the housekeeping manager
