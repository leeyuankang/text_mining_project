i would say however for one night it s expensive even on a deal so if you plan on staying here make sure it s a special occasion or something the way the hotel is as it stands is marvellous but i would say from my experience i just didn t feel i was getting my money s worth check in and check out next day just isn t reasonable maybe a full hours should be given to the one night s stay customers i feel that the hotel is missing something that will make people feel happy about spending that kind of money like a free spa or something swimming pool sauna steam etc as it stands the only freebies would be a gym which isn t fun or relaxing in my eyes and a complimentary bottle of wine or cake the cake was delicious by the way it just felt like i d paid for it or something please don t get me wrong i loved my time in this hotel and i was amazed at how beautiful the interior was and i was extremely comfortable but i m just not used to spending so much on one night and it being just for the room itself on another note the only thing i didn t like was that there was splash stains on the wall in the bathroom was a bit icky and ruined the view of the bathroom
