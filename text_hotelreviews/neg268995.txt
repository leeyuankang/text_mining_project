housekeeping came in late to our room the first day we told them it was ok and there was nothing to clean yet so we took towels and papers and then it looks like they took advantage of it that we were easy going about it long story short we took towels from the housekeeper till the last night than we asked them to tend for our room so out of the nights we stayed we had our room clean once out the time we checked in
