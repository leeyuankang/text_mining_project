i had a terrible experience with the staff at my arrival the receptionist barely looked me in the eyes and kept sighing i left my luggage and waited the expected check in time when it arrived i went back to the front desk and the room wasn t ready when i asked how long i would have to wait in order to see if it was the case to stay there or go out the answer was another sigh and i don t know when i came back i waited a good ten minutes before getting the key then asked for my luggage and i ve been send to the other side of the front desk where i queued for another minutes and received as an answer this is another front desk we don t do luggage ask the concierge i went to the concierge and waited another minutes before he brought me to a luggage room opened it and let me look for my luggage among a pile although i gave him the numbered ticket everybody looked at me as i was bothering them sighing and treating me with indifference a very cold and unpleasant welcome for this price and from a hotel i would have expected more
