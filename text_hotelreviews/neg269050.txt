the staff were ignorant very rude two blonde girls behind the reception desk have absolutely no manners at all when we checked in we were told we could pay altogether at checkout and then we had to pay then and there and me and my partner intended to spilt the bill at checkout we weren t allowed to do that that then it tells us no where online when booking this that you have to pay immediately at check in and it doesn t say anywhere yous need a credit card for payment either for deposit yous are an absolute joke
