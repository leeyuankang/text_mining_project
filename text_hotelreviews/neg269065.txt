i ve stayed at this property times in the past years and the staff at the check in counter are generally unfriendly and dismissive on this trip as usual i had a lousy experience during check in unhelpful and sarcastic when i had questions staff s name was roy i was placed in a very small room on the first floor much smaller than the previous times i ve stayed here and after a while there was a really bad sewage smell from the toilet when i called to tell them the problem there was no investigation or effort on their part to check what s wrong with the room and while i appreciate that they accepted my request to switch rooms it seemed like they already knew the problem with this room plus the room i d gotten was much bigger the usual size as my previous stays i hope the property can look into the problem and not place guests in there if you know the room is unfit for guests the difference in size in the room is also ridiculous considering guests pay the same amount for the same room type
