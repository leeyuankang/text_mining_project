overall low value to money quite expensive for what the hotel has to offer the rooms are ok but for the price we paid it was a little disappointing the hotel felt a little old fashioned the wifi was quite slow the hotel staff wasn t very nice we were three young couples in our late s hardly the kind that interrupts other guests or makes any noise yet when the receptionist realized we are a group of friends he told us he is going to upgrade our rooms we did not ask for any upgrade to our surprise the upgrade was rooms in the first floor with a view to an ugly grey roof we did not complain or ask to change the rooms but it was quite insulting when we checked out we had an intern handling us and there was a problem with the computer so the checkout procedure took a lot of time and we got to the airport late we enjoyed our vacation very much because we were out all day
