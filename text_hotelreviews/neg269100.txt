there was a party going on in the apartment building outside of our window on their private porch and deck there was loud music and a lot of people talking from i complained to the hotel staff beginning at hotel staff went outside to ask them to quiet down and said they would call the police if they didn t the party turned the music down a bit and carried on the party noise and music rose back up again so i called the police myself they said they had no report from the hotel to shut down the party and that i should tell the hotel to report it i went downstairs at again and showed the number to hotel staff that i had called and he said yes we ve called the police ourselves they are on their way it did take another minutes for the police to get there and shut down the party the private party in the next building certainly was not the hotel s fault hotel staff handled it well except it took hours to shut the party down
