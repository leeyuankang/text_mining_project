bed very uncomfortable i received a queen bed but it sagged straight down in the middle which resulted in me falling into the middle during the night pillows are terrible as well although star there are just too many small things that could ve been a bit nicer such as the quality size of towels as well i would rate this closer to star and will not stay at this hotel again on my next trip to amsterdam
