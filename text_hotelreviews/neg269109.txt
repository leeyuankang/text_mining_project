to improve the suites should be on a higher level with some sort of view for over per night looking out onto someone s house isn t ideal also it stated we would have a very large double bed this was just two singles pushed together i did not mind the frosted glass for the bathroom but are they creating this hotel for couples or other people because everything does not have one target market also the suite was a large size fantastic however there was a square in the room where nothing was and did not look out onto anything nice so we did not use it therefore i feel as though we used the same space as was available for a normal room but got ripped off having this extra space where there was nothing to do also no mirror in the room except behind the wardrobe door so had to do make up in the bathroom which is annoying when my partner wanted to get ready maybe to improve have a dressing table with mirror in the square so it can be used the hotel was also linked to hotel eden i don t know which was the more expensive but felt slightly annoying having to put our luggage in their hotel when there was a luggage room in our hotel overall there is a lot to be improved for the suite rooms especially when booking because we wanted the extra space not an empty space
