we had a small room for the price our room was in one of the wings not in the main part of the hotel it was a long walk to get there since there are not elevators directly to that part of the hotel i don t think those rooms had been updated for awhile we had some mold in the bathroom a bus stop is in front of the hotel so coming going we always had to fight a crowd waiting for the bus
