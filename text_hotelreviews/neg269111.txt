the wifi could be improved basically only fast enough to use messaging apps like whatsapp but you ll find it s too slow to stream videos you can get a code from the frontdesk to access their other wifi router but the access point seems to be buggy and sporadically disconnected me overall you ll be too busy exploring the city to even worry about the wifi in the hotel
