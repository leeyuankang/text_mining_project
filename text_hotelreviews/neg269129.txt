i did not book an apartment but some how my booking has ended up as an apartment i simply don t know how apartment was cleaned only the first day it was not cleaned nor towels changed for the next nights i informed the reception times the answer was we are sorry they promised to send clean towels within minutes they never came the front office girl who took my complant should have followed up without just noting down since this hotel is within walking distance from your office you should inspect it personally the stairs too steep narrow to carry heavy baggage i am yrs old had sample baoxes that i bought for a trade fair look at the bed there is hardly any room to get into the bed from the sides unless you get in from the front i always book thru you look at my past booking history this stay was my worst travel experience i did not pay euro plus to stay at an apartment bedside lamps bathroom mirror lights not working
