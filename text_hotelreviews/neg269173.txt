i didn t like the fact that i booked an apartment and when i arrived it was like an old people home it was old fashion it wasn t in the hotel it was down the road the bed had cobwebs and there wasn t lighting and it was just very poor all over i do think also i got lied to when i was trying to check in as my flight arrived early at they made us wait until on the sofa until we could check in they could improve this by perhaps offering early check in i m sure there are rooms available or even at a cost but it should become available because we wasn t the only ones
