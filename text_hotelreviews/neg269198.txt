our double bed was twins pushed together there wasn t even a double topper to combine them so the beds would push apart during the night we also had single duvets so we were practically in separate beds with only small square pillow each our cleaner did not clean thoroughly we only had a small bathroom bin and therefore had no where to put our rubbish which didn t get taken by the cleaner the magnifying mirror in the bathroom was also very grubby and on cupboard door hinges you could see thick dust on arrival we had empty complimentary body lotion so obviously had not checked before our arrival during our stay we noticed people hanging around the entrance of the hotel until someone with a key card opened the hotel doors and they would then make use of our hotel facilities i feel that staff was limited we were often waiting at reception in a long queue during check in and out times also when we were picking up dropping off luggage at the holding rooms
