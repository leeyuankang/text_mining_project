we booked the junior executive room and requested a double bed but when we arrived in our room we realized the bed was in fact two single beds pushed together we went back to the reception and asked to change to a real double bed room and were told this was not possible we were also told that out of the rooms in the hotel there were only about with double beds no surprise that this was a common issue now that i read the reviews more carefully they could have made this clear on booking com and shouldn t pretend that two single beds pushed together become a double bed
