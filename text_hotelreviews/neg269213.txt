the reception staff when checking out were very rude and having to deal with us seemed like a hindrance the room was a bit shabby and the walls could really do with re decorating the outer handle on the room door was loose making me question how safe our belongings would be when we were out and thankful for the safe in the room the soundproofing was non existent making it very difficult to sleep due to the noise from outside poor value for money
