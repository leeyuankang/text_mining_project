we had an executive room it was lovely as was the vip lounge which we used however the bed was terrible it sloped to one side which resulted in me sleeping on the edge of the bed all night no refund for the room was offered for one night stay expecting luxury should have chosen the premier inn as they guarantee a good night sleep or your money back
