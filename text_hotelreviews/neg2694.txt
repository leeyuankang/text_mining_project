dreadful staff who would not help despite their booking process being unclear they need the card you book the room under to be present at check in which is useless for corporate bookings they will not take card payment over the phone or web because of fraud but would be happy to take a payment from the same card if you didn t turn up happy to leave two guests waiting in reception with no access to room whilst this was resolved really bad experience won t be booking again they also want to photocopy your driving license and bank card and try to tell you that you have to sign up to their loyalty club
