poor room service hair of a previous guest in the sink mold and dirt in the sink and in bathroom bedding with holes and put inside out limescale on the shower head which resulted in erratic water flow there was also no toilet brush which led to uncomfortable situations the hotel design is ambitious with emphasis on appearance but not very practical for example the sink has a rectangular shape which requires special care so that no mold and dirt accumulates in it we found dirt and mold there design of the room doors they are difficult to see find especially for first time visitors which may cause guests trying to open a wrong room s door that could explain why someone tried to get in our room in the night and also the condition of the lock in our room the air conditioning temperature cannot be set from the room you have to ask the reception the elevator once stopped and opened the door in the middle of the floors
