couple of issues minor moderate ones i specifically asked not to get service i just do not like housekeeping going in my room when it is just a short stay when i returned to my room i could notice my request was not respected what is even worse the cleaning lady emptied the trash bins but left them in the middle of the room next to the empty tissue box from the bathroom that she did not refill seemed like she kind of left the room in the middle of the cleaning process i asked for help for a specific restaurant and i was suggested to visit one when i got there i needed to realized that they have no items on their menu according to the specific diet i was asking guidance for major ones needed to wait cca minutes for my invoice at check out because they could not manage earlier to figure out how to add the name of my company even though i requested this already when i made the booking i was offered a discount due to the inconvenience with the room i did not ask for it but when the staff realized that i pre paid my room they just simply said oh okay so then there is nothing to pay well this is quite unprofessional
