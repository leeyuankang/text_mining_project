this was one of our favourite hotels in london as you can see from our earlier reviews through the years but sadly all gone down hill the young lady at reception was miserable even when we asked for a smile she grimaced room filthy when i moved the small minibar which made so much noise we had to unplug has never been cleaned there since opening asked for a double bed got singles no slippers or bathrobe or breakfast for euro a night get real
