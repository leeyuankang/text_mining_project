i was sharing a suite with my mum who is years old and i requested a room with a shower but unfortunately they have no rooms with separate shower cubicles all the rooms have bath tubs with shower attachments and my mum was unable to use this i also found when i used the shower in the bath tub the water was escaping through the glass door onto the floor no matter how careful i was the bathrooms are very pretty but could do with an update
