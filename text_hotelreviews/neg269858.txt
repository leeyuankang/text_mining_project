everything was awesome with this hotel the only thing that could be improved was really a small thing the wifi was fast but every time you left the hotel and if you were up after midnight the system would kick you off and you had to go back through the registration again it was not a huge deal except for the fact that the user id was a totally random character id and the password was another random six character password it was so random that it took me a few days to even get close to memorizing it even though i had to enter it about four times per day this would in no way keep me from staying at this hotel but just a very very very small item that kept it from absolute perfection
