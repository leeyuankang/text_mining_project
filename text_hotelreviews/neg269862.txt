did not like that the hotel is a smoking hotel we travel a month every year all over europe have never encountered a smoking hotel i believe booking should note this on their reservation site the hotel has non smoking floors and we might of gone for that the problem is when there is smoke it travels to the other floors i am highly allergic they did change our room the last night due to a cancellation which i really appreciated
