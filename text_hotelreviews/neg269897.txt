the first remark when we arrived was you don t get any points because you booked through booking com you would have gotten points for this visit the air conditioning leaked all over the carpeting luckily the temperatures in vienna were cool and we could open the windows which allowed noise from other rooms the bathroom a the shower squirted water all over the place and it leaked at the handle b the tub has very high sides and was most difficult to get into c the floor of the bathroom was very slick especially when the shower leaked water the beds were very uncomfortable but due to our tiredness we were able to sleep after our night at the hotel service changed because as we were informed the switch over to best western had taken place the result we lost wi fi couldn t connect breakfast changed from an elegant table service including made to order eggs to a typical and certainly ok breakfast buffet we weren t informed that if the desk called for a taxi the taxi fare would cost an extra euros
