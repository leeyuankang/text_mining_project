breakfast tables are a bit cramped for all the food that is served to your table unfortunately the furniture in the bedroom is laid out really badly for example my bedside table concealed the safety box which only left one small drawer to use the only other set of drawers was next to the other side of the bed which was difficult to access and not sufficient space the safety box did not work properly the batteries were flat but even changing them couldn t make it work the tv channels in english consisted of cnn news and nothing else the bath shower was small and narrow with a half glass door which meant water spilled all over the floor toilet seat with each shower
