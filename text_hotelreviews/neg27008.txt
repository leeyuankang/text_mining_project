the grovenor is a lovely hotel but they are not friendly in terms of flexiblity we booked months in advance needed to change the date by four days still months in advance and were not allowed to change the reservation even one day there fore i would not recommend this hotel to friends it is located in a great spot but going there with teenage kids was a big challenging since there was no pool a very small workout room and as i stated earlier no flexibility in the reservation even many months in advance
