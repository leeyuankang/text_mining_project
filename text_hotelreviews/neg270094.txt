the personell serving the breakfast were almost rude not a smile or a goodmorning not a good start on the day parking near the hotel is almost impossible we were told to park below the opera were we would only be charged per day after three days we ended paying so watch out there is a small garden yard at the hotel but unfortunately it is not very cosy it could have been a great little garden yard but it is not the hotel is also lacking a bar or just a nice place to sit in the lobby after a long day in town the hotel was not too expensive so i guess you get what you pay for big improvements could be made with small funds
