although i booked a refundable room the hotel blocked the price weeks prior to the trip they made me pay again meanwhile i got a new card connected to the same account the card number was different which i didn t realize until later i immediately notified the hotel we exchanged a few letters but euro is still not on my account paying two times for the same room is rather upsetting
