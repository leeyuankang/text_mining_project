i live here for night when i checked out my package was stolen in the live room just meters agaist the reception the staff didn t do any help and obvioursly didn t want to call the police she asked us to go to the police station but there s not much time left for us to the airport and we were forienger in wien it is difficult for us to find a police station the staff did nothing about that so in my opinion this hotel totally didn t want to take any responsbility about the safety of the guest i will never promote this hotel to anyone never
