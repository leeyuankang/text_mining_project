we expected a welcome drink and instead we were greeted with a heavy cigarette smell having travelled all night we asked for a quiet room we were told the room would be quiet but the room were were given was separated from the next room with a thin wooden door we had to listen to the conversations next door and if we had known chinese we would have known what they were talking about there was a lot of noise in the corridor too it turned out to be the cleaning staff joking around loudly the bathroom was disappointing towels were old and grayish the shower curtain too was old and grayish the toilet seat was worn out on the outside and underneath the heavy cigarette smell was all around it was on the third floor in the hall and along the stairs we noticed some rooms had a non smoking room sign on the door and asked at the reception what that meant we were told that they were old signs all rooms were non smoking and the hotel was smoke free we said that could not be true given the heavy smell the staff member dismissed our concern and said we will check as though the smell was not all around us when we insisted she blamed a woman who had just smoked outside as the source of smell the fact was that the heavy smell in the lobby was coming from the staff room behind the reception we left for a walk but came back in a minute to pick up our umbrella the door behind the reception was shut confirming our suspicion
