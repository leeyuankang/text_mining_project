this is our third time staying at the grosvenor in the past two years we moved in the grosvenor from a hotel located in the financial district after business meetings that hotel provided customers with free breakfast it was disappointed that there was no breakfast included for our three nights staying at the grosvenor this time however breakfast was included in our previous two times staying at the grosvenor we told the front desk staff the fact and requested for breakfast to be included but the request was rejected we think the grosvenor should treat its loyal customers better
