the mattress was not comfortable nor were the floppy saggy pillows and there was no top sheet just a comforter the worst thing was that the bathrooms had a bad smell i assume the plumbing is very old i had to change room because of it and while the second one didn t smell as much of sewage as the first one it did have a slight bad smell really unpleasant i had to keep the door closed at all times and spend as little time as possible in the bathroom finally the wifi quality was terrible in both rooms i stayed in it was not possible to video skype or video facetime and even audio facetime kept breaking up really frustrating overall the hotel is old and tired and really in need of refurbishment definitely not a star hotel i would not go back
