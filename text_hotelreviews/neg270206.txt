most of the issues are quite minor they should not stop you from booking a room in this hotel a couple of improvements that can make life easier it would be nice to have a shower curtain in apartments bathrooms and some set of extra pillows will also make the life better please note that apartments are located on the floor that can be accessed through a narrow winding stairs only this cannot be changed in the building that is several centuries old
