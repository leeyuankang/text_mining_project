there was no sign of the refreshment in the room so as very thirsty on arrival went downstairs with old and were charged for of tea then on returning to room and going to unpack found the kettle etc hidden away in cupboard which i found most annoying especially as my granddaughter was quite tired and we had to wait some time for our teas to be served
