stayed here times before this time first room was so cluttered we could not store luggage we were advised the hotel had been recently renovated and room configurations changed we paid an extra to upgrade to a larger room only to have a shower that varied from hot to cold with little pressure the light in the bathroom fell out and the toilet roll holder was broken on raising this with reception we received refund we now know our worth as a repeat client
