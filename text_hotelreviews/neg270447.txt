the hotel is very small and oldfashioned not what i was expecting after seeing the photos for this price in germany i can find a high level hotel like ritz or marriott there is no fridge mini bar in the room no shelf in the bathroom the safe is on the bottom and the biggest minus is that they took the money twice from my credit card that s disappointing
