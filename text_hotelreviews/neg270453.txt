when i booked the hotel i was really excited as the photos looked fantastic and looked like i could be staying in a proper star hotel untill i got there i did book a comfort room but got upgraded to a superior room so i was thinking fantastic this is going to be brilliant well got in to the room and it was a baby blue coloured room with a nice big stain over the wall and lock was broken off in the bathroom so when i just the door went to leave and it was locked both me and the misses ended up trying to open this lock for a good mins and i wouldnt wish anybody to get locked in there by themself cracked mirror and yellow stains round the window no idear so kept the blind shut no kettel in room even tho i requested and was not informed i could not fill up my baby bottles in the room so i had to use the coffee machine down stairs in reception which wasnt to bad but still a inconvenience really was expecting more from the hotel room specialy when i asked am i in the right room and the said its a upgrade and followed on with that they was refurbished months ago
