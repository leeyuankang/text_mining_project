unfortunately i got bed bugs during my stay the bites showed up the day i left and they proceeded to get worse as the week went on until i finally went to the doctor s and was diagnosed it s a shame too because the hotel seemed lovely i had noticed several other types of bugs ones the eye could see obviously and was able to eliminate them myself i thought about asking for another room but convinced myself there was nothing to worry about thus unfortunately i would not recommend this place until they have resolved the problem
