the hotel is kind of far from city center so you need to take tram or bike the hotel is in the middle of residential neighborhood the neighborhood is quiet nice though when we arrived the napkins box was left empty in the toilet there was hair from after shave from the people before us and it wasn t cleaned the next day when we left the room we came back and we found that the room was only organized but nothing was cleaned the hair was still on the floor and the dirty towels were hanged again though we made sure we put them on the floor we told this to the reception and the hotel manager when we checked out they apologized and they offered us free coffee the price is not worth the value you get
