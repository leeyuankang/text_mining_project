the lift is tiny barely accommodates two with luggage don t plan on the stairs with your bags as an alternate option they are extremely steep the bathroom towel bar was so high i could barely reach it to get towels and the room could use more hooks for towels robes etc wifi was a little slow at times these annoyances are not enough to wave me off from staying again if in the area loved the location and friendly staff
