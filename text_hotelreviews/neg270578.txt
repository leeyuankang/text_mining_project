the television was a nightmare to work the bathroom although very nice had sloping ceilings so banging my head was a regular event and we stayed for nights and were only provided with the complimentary toiletries on the first night which wasn t very good as we had paid for nights the hotel has a beautiful seating area and restaurant but does not offer meals other than breakfast
