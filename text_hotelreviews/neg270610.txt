unfortunately there was some very noisy drilling going on behind our bathroom wall on the last morning which we were woken up by and had to call the reception to ask them to stop although they were apologetic stopped it and even gave us a slight discount because of it i felt they should have been better organized and not scheduled maintenance work next to a room that was occupied
