would be nice to have tea and coffee making facilities in the room although there was always a complimentary bottle of normal and sparkling water on each occasion we drank them the room we stayed in had a tiny bath so if you like to soak away you would have to tuck your knees up the shower was a hose attachment to the bath taps not really powerful but as long as it worked and cleaned you who cares its only for a couple of days and we shower rather than bath so the size of bath didn t bother us not sure if all the rooms have the same size baths
