it is quiet far from the center but close to the tram also is walk from van gogh s museum the hotel is fully renovated and rooms are very nice excepto for the fact that don t have ac and rooms are too hot during summer time something not acceptable in a hotel also parking is possible at the hotel area paying hr between the rest of the time is free they have no one for your loggage and a very small elevator
