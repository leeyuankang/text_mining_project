this isn t a star hotel more like a star we were right next to the lifts our room was not ready on arrival despite arriving minutes after check in bar prices were extortionate and to top it all off they had messed up my bill and charged me almost an extra pounds the lady on reception was apologetic and i was reimbursed but i am still very unhappy they blamed booking com so i will be making a formal complaint
