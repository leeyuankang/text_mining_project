the room was very noisy you could actually hear the elevators moving day and night because the noisy from the elevators came through the pipes of the air conditioning right into the room this was extremely annoying especially at night the breakfast eur was overpriced the furniture in the room looked pretty shabby and out dated considering the amount i paid it was definitely not worth the money
