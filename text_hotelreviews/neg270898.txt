sadly my partner and i experienced an uncomfortable moment on wed evening april at robertos we did arrive late for dinner at at the door we stated we wished to sit down to a meal and were invited to a table sadly we felt we were rushed to make a decision on our meals the waiter was initially quite abrupt and his body language indicated we were a bother to him he did however warm in his manners towards my partner and i after we made an extra effort to be pleasant to him guilt methinks if the kitchen was closed at the time of our arrival then my partner and i would have been more than understanding if we were advised this and ordered room service at a cost of the ambience did not meet this cost
