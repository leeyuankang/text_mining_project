we arrived and the room that we had booked but the entire hotel was overbooked so for the first night we stayed at a double room and then we got an upgrade for a suite for the following days of our stay but the room was freezing cold the maintenance department came to fix the problem the problem was presumably fixed but it really wasn t very bad decor and really disappointing facilities i will not visit again
