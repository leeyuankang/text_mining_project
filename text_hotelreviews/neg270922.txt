location is a real negative euro for a taxi from airport or to city centre is very expensive perhaps a free shuttle service provided by the hotel would motivate me to consider this hotel in the future i would not recommend this hotel for this reason the prices of food from room service and mini bar is way beyond hotel inflation rates euro for a can of coke is extortion although the room service food itself was really nice but very over priced we stay in hiltons all over the world and this is by far the most expensive we have ever experienced we also phoned the hotel from the city centre train station to ask for directions to be told to get on tram and get off at gerrit street which was the wrong information resulting in us getting very lost with no mobile phone charge and or without taxi bus near by we landed at and never got to our hotel until hours later as the actual stop we were meant to get off at was emma s street on tram this was a train tram bus and finally flagged down a taxi and all the charges we incurred was a very negative experience for us as it used up a lot of the very limited time we had in amsterdam
