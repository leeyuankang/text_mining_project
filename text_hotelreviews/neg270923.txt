i was pretty disappointed being charged euro for a bottle of still water from mini bar this is extremely unreasonable and ridiculous given the usd price for the room and there was no price list if i new the price i would drink the water from the tap and be careful once you take anything from the mini bar even if you put back you will be immediately charged for that
