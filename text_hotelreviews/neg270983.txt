parking welcome customers please park your car in our hotel parking lot at a rate of euros per day then every time you want to leave the hotel to get food or drive around you have to wait in line to get your ticket scanned by a member at the front desk this is so disappointing that it ruins all the great things about this hotel its not like it s located in the best spot you need to take a minute tram ride to get into town my next stay will not be at this hotel for this very reason this is making me try another hotel closer to city center restaurant for diner i could explain in detail but i would just say don t eat here not worth the euro markup on every dish
