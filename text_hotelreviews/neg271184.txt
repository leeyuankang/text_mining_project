i ve stayed here before because of the location but i feel really let down major refurbishment works going on dust everywhere drilling banging for gods sake close the hotel down and do the work so guests don t have to suffer the hassle of stepping through a building site still charging full price for the rooms breakfast is and is self serve can t eat food in the bar even when there are no tables left in the restaurant non dutch guests treated really poorly by the staff
