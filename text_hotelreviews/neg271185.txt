hotel is undergoing some refurbishment so entrance hall was not very welcoming and had to negotiate workmen to get to restaurant during working hours very difficult to get a table in the restaurant we were told they were fully booked on nights even though we could see empty tables as we walked to alternative restaurants nearby limited computer access at business centre perhaps due to improvements there is apparently a shuttle from the airport but no instructions about where to find it
