i was not aware it was being refurbished and parts were a building site very loud at night from doors banging and people drinking on a boat on the water i was floors up and with all my windows closed and could still hear music and talking shouting not sure if i was unlucky or this is a regular thing generally the hotel was fine but i expected more for the money
