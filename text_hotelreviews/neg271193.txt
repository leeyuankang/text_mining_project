i visited an exhibition in amsterdam rai and i preferred this hotel because of its location i wanted to stay in a canal view room but it was a complete dissapointment they gave us room which is one of the worst rooms for canal view there are trees in front of window and room located in the corner of the building which has more road view than a canal view heating system was not working you can t heat the room if central heating system s radiator is not working a c system is only a fan blowing air into the room outside tempreature was c which was cold for a mediterranean person despite we informed the heating problem nothing happened during our day stay day we returned to room at june there was a minibar in the room which should have bottles of water refreshment everyday but they were not there i called the room service to buy but room service didn t answer the phone then i called the front desk and nobody answered as well also same day towels and bathroom amentities were not refreshed either in addition to above hotel building is an old building and requires a serious rennovation in front desk and elevators there was a construction work in the ground floor they were building a new restaurant everywhere was full of workers dust and construction materials which should be informed prior booking
