we were allocated a basement room with no view unless you climbed up a vertical ladder to the window seat and then there was a whopping great boat straight in front of the window this didn t set a good start especially at the price the full breakfast is very pricey too euros pp and though we opted for a smaller breakfast and no one told us that this was only available as room service euros per order we had it in the dining room and they added the room service to our bill which fortunately i picked up and got deleted this place is good but pricey
