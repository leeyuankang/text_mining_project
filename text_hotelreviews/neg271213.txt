the hotel is under renovation currently and we weren t told of this by booking com this had a negative impact on our stay the air conditioning in the bedrooms couldn t be turned off or adjusted it was noisy and inefficient leading to a very warm dry atmosphere in the room and this kept us awake when we asked for it to be switched off we were told by staff it is an old system due to be updated when the rooms are renovated the area from reception to the restaurant is like walking through a building site most unpleasant
