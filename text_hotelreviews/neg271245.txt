on arrival our reservation could not be found we are not sure which party is to blame here which meant we had to make a new one luckily the hotel was not fully booked otherwise there would have been a problem the hotel was also in the process of a major renovation project which meant the main bar and reception area were not in use if we had known about this we probably wouldn t have booked a room here the room had a leaking shower and the hairdryer was faulty although a replacement hairdryer was supplied it s cord was so short it couldn t be used in front of a mirror the shower was still faulty when we checked out
