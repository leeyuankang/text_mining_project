we asked before arrival for a room with a bath tub as it shows you in the pictures of the room on their website we received a room with no bath tub the room was cold the heater in the room blew out cold air only even when turned up to the max setting of the radiator in the room was located in front of the full length window and the curtains closed in front of the radiator meaning we had no heat at all in the room with the curtains closed i understand it was cold outside but it was uncomfortably cold in the room at any point of the day or night the walls were paper thin it felt like we came to this hotel for a relaxing break away as my partner was weeks pregnant when we arrived for our stay we were awoken throughout the night by a screaming baby on two nights of our stay in another room woken from people running down the hallway during the night and on our last morning the hotel had a cherry picker parked outside our window with its engine running from a m making it impossible to get back to sleep after an already disturbed nights sleep no different to our three previous nights stay for a four star hotel i feel it lacked a level of class and professionalism people usually go on holiday to relax from their already busy and stressful lives we were unfortunately unable to do this whilst staying at the wyndham apollo hotel amsterdam i have stayed in hotels in amsterdam since and this was my worst experience here yet i would never stay here again the staff were polite and approachable but to call this a star hotel seems a little insulting to the other star hotels i have stayed in in amsterdam i hope to hear back from someone at apollo regarding my issues with my stay
