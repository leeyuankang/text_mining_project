it is not a minute walk really have your staff do it with a suitcase or two be more realistic and understand the distance three different staff gave different routes to the hotel consider standardizing your guest directions protocol and also consider the following stop on the tram it is more of a straight line i suspect i am not the only guest that got lost also the big white building apollo house though large is dark at night there are some little things that your staff needs to work on attention to detail concierge needs to explain things carefully and slowly and write legibly if the concierge is working on something and a guest walks up they should demonstrate their communication skills and acknowledge the guest especially after seconds have elapsed the shower needs a manual it is difficult for to know how to operate if the guest is not familiar with this type of not so universal type of shower tv also perhaps needs a manual or maybe the one in my room after turning on the tv the tv button needs to be pressed then something else telephones on the different floors need to have the number in which to contact the front desk labeled clearly this is just my personal preference and opinion don t have a staff meeting at the front desk use a conference room it makes your check in process very intimidating for guest and raises questions if it seems like i am being nit picky then i apologize but i guarantee you this not paying attention to the small details is what causes hotels to fail because the guests do not return and in most cases they do not offer feedback
