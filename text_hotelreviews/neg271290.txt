my only beef was that the website says that the shuttle is available hours a day when we got to the airport and looked for the shuttle we were told that it did not operate from a m to p m when most flights arrive which is a little frustrating if you are on an early flight or a late flight however be aware there is a free shuttle to the hotel from the airport they charge euros good deal to take you back from the hotel to the airport
