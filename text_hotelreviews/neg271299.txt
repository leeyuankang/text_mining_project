i spilt a cup of coffee on my quilt the first night of my stay and the quilt was never changed for the remaining five nights went without toilet paper for two days and facial tissue box was empty for my entire stay and floor was never vacuumed very disappointing to sleep on same sheets and quilt for a six night stay and use hand towels for toilet paper and to blow my noise this is understandable for a third world country not amsterdam price for breakfast buffet was extremely high and food choices remained the same with no variance
