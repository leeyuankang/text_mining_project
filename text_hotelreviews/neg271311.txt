this was a most over rated and expensive hotel i have ever stayed in i was charged an exorbitant rate more than double the usual for what i consider was a normal room with a canal view my room stank of cigar smoke when i entered it even though it was a non smoking room the breakfast was not included even though i had paid such a high price for my room the breakfast was overpriced anyhow
