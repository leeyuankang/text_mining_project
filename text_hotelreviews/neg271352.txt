the information about the free shuttle needs to be made clear i only knew about it after reading some reviews so when we landed at the airport we rushed over to the bus stand only to find out that the shuttle had stopped running an hr previous we had even contacted the hotel to let them know what time we were landing but there was no mention of the shuttle not running at that time
