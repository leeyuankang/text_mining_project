when we arrived at on our first night to check in we were informed that significant damage had been caused to the first and second floors due to flooding and we would not be able to stay in the hotel for our first and possibly subsequent nights we were disappointed that this had not been communicated to us before we arrived the reception staff said they would arrange for us to stay at their partner hotel the ramada and whilst we of course appreciated that we had a bed for the night this hotel was in a completely different part of the city a euro taxi ride away on our first morning we had no idea if the wyndham would be ready for our second night in the city and therefore had to pack up our things and leave our luggage in the left luggage facility at the ramada to prevent us being called back from exploring the city later that day in the case that our room was ready and we had to check out the ramada as it happened our room was ready later that day and we stayed in the wyndham for three rather than four nights rather bizarrely when we arrived at the wyndham to check in none of the three staff on reception were aware of the significant damage that the flooding had caused to two floors leading my friend and i to wonder whether we had been victims of the hotel overbooking it was a busy weekend given that europride was taking place by way of apology we were offered free breakfast i would rather have had a refund for the first night given that websites including booking com advertised a night at the ramada as cheaper than the wyndham however we were told it was free breakfast or nothing so we did go on one morning i still feel let down that the hotel did not refund the night we lost especially given the time exploring the city we lost out on because of having to move between the hotels and the fact we paid for four nights but only stayed three
