although the beds were really comfy every morning we were woken up by deliveries or what sounded like building work it really was so so loud we were on the top floor too so that tells you how bad it was it meant we didn t get much sleep at all the wifi also didn t work at all the whole time we were there so i had to pay for extra data the whole time really annoying the website also says there s a tramp stop on the doorstep of the hotel we decided this was false advertising as the tram stop is a good minute walk away and not easy to find the first time
