i didn t like first room on ground floor air conditioning not working lights in bathroom not working no clear communication of opening closing hours for food drink different prices for food drink depending upon which restaurant or bar you were in being sent to another bar to get a drink because one bar didn t have a bottle in at the time being told that i couldn t walk through the restaurant with my briefcase and i had to go in through the hotel entrance being told that i shouldn t take my coffee in a china cup out of breakfast and i should use the paper one and so on basically whilst the staff were pleasant the hotel seemed to be run for it s own convenience rather than guests
