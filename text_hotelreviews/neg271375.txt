we had some minor wifi problems wifi in our bedroom was not working accept when we were standing next to the entrance door but as soon as we have mentioned it it might has been a problem with our devices we are not sure we received a room upgrade free of charge staff changed this slightly negative thing into a hugely positive thing with fast wifi
