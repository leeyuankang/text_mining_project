the reason the hotel was chosen was the convenience and availability of the shuttle bus but one either had to leave no later than or late in the afternoon to take the shuttle which did not suit us staff explained how to take a bus and or tram to amsterdam south railway station then a train to airport which worked out well the formal kitchen restaurant was a disappointment as we could not see a menu before entering and when seated found the choices to be mostly expensive seafood oysters and sushi and a very limited choice of other dishes loud mindless music was also being played so we left and ate in the more casual area a warning the slate tiles near the kitchen of the restaurant are very slippery i almost slipped twice and some maintenance is required
