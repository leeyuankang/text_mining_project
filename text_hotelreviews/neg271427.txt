the room was utterly hot and the air was amazingly dry we tried to tweak the airco system but it didn t improve anything we then even called reception to send someone up to help us amend the climate of the room the guy who showed up to help mentioned that we shouldn t turn the ac high because since it was still on winter setting it would only make the room hotter which sounded weird to us but ok we tried after turning it off the temperature didn t seem to move eitiher we could slightly open the window but that didn t help either so in the end we woke up soaking wet of sweat and with a headache that didn t leave us till the end of the day for a hotel that is far from cheap one would expect more comfort on something relatively easy as regulating the climate big miss
