finding your room in the building is something else the numbering of the rooms is really unnecessary complex my room on the ground floor was fine view of a blank wall was not something i expected but as i was there for work it didnt matter too much the breakfast offering is very disappointing for a hotel of this standing a very limited menu with everything based on a self service concept to be fair the cost does reflect this but it is not what i expected of a star international hotel
