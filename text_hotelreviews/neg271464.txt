only thing we weren t impressed with was the staff at the bar breakfast area on our departure day we went to get our complimentary drink but were quickly shoo s away because apparently the area was too busy there were people on one table it was the way we felt we were just sort of pushed away so we didn t stay and just left the lady at the desk tried to sort it but we didn t really feel like staying afterwards other then that we can t complain at all
