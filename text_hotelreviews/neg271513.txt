booked an upstairs room online but given a downstairs room when we refused two single beds pushed together from the humourless receptionist given a voucher for a free drink beware this only covered the tonic in a g and t we had to pay for the pricey gin a charge of euros per hours is made for tv channels internet and films so be careful before you log on the staff were functional and efficient if not friendly and we were not given any information about the hotel so unaware of bike hire or presence of a gym
