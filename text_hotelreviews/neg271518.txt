the waiter was so slow i approached him to get service he told me that he was too busy and minutes later threw one menu onto the table for my wife and me we were so annoyed we left without food and reported it to reception who apologised and were as helpful in finding an alternative restaurant as possible the external hotel was tired with weeds growing through the driveway not up to your usual standards
