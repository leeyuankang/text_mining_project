the room was small and gloomy with dark panelling and inconvenient lighting it looked out into a tiny well and was badly overlooked by another room so i had to keep the curtains closed more gloom i assume i was given the room because i was travelling alone but i booked for people and i was paying the same as people i don t appreciate being treated as a class citizen
