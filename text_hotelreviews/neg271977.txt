this hotel was so central even my taxi couldn t find it the listing on booking com should inform guests that not all taxi drivers understand that they are permitted to enter the pedestrianised area i had to drag my luggage down two streets and got lost the room was tiny and would not have been suitable had there been two of us there was only a sheet on the bed and a blanket in the wardrobe barcelona might be warm but its not that hot unfortunately i had come from hotel artes so it had a lot to live up to and it simply did not compare there was zero facilities except for a pool which i chose not to use more importantly the cafe wasn t even open for coffee in the morning unless you had booked breakfast you had to go next door to a cafe the room facilities consisted of instant tea and coffee and a stocked mini bar which i didn t use i wouldn t return to this hotel given what else is on offer nearby
