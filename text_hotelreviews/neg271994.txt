you might find this an odd comment to make but they do not follow what is common practice today regarding clean towels in hotels most hotels have the policy that if you want a clean bath or hand towel you place the towel on the floor if you are willing to reuse it how dirty can it really be you hang it up this hotel could save tons of money if they used this policy and didn t snap up the towels twice a day what a waste of resources
