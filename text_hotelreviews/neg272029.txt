location of our room apparently my fault because i asked for a view i got solar panels half the pool railings and rooftops at the back of the hotel all from a window no juliet balcony as shown in the room photos we could not open the curtains fully as people using the pool could see directly in a totally clear glass bathroom toilet door what s that all about we were offered to move next day but decided not to bother that was before the lift kept going nuts room next to the lift first morning the lift door was repeatedly opening and closing itself and banging at and then again at i had to phone reception both times because they could not hear it trust me we could continually inconsistent servicing of room water one night no water next night no milk i don t expect this at star level paid more than expected probably due to euro in fairness staff kept apologising and gave us complementary breakfast in truth i would rather all had been well
