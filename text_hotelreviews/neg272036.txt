finding the location of the hotel was a bit confusing our cab was not able to drop us off in front of the hotel for some reason so we started off a little turned around not ideal on cobble stone streets while carting luggage maybe it would have been easier if the cab dropped us off near cathedral of barcelona with fewer cobbles overall convient hotel location
