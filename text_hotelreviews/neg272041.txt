the rooms are a bit dark the hotel was constructed in an ancient cathedral and the window opens on the interior of the hotel with a glass elevator at the center so you cannot really open your window without having pretty much every other room clients and elevator users watching you they vaporized too much perfume in the lobby and the smell was too strong and unpleasant the deco of the rooms is too sober black and grey which is a bit depressing especially given that the natural light does not enter the rooms especially those located in the first floor
