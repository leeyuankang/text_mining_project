noise is an issue here noise from the outside the double glazed windows don t do a thing to soundproof noise from the corridor the worst part is that the bathroom door is only a smoked glass pane no auditory privacy whatsoever awkward also the standard room was a little small for two people the restaurant while it had received good reviews was always deserted and lonely felt dark and enclosed we ate elsewhere all three days
