breakfast i consider it too healthy just for vegetarians buy some solid staff in the mall food store no available olive or other oils even salt is not at hand you should ask for it but healthier pepper is on table the only positive in breakfast fresh and good bread very expensive car parking a way to discourage use of polluting cars
