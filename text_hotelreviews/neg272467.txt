the selection of breakfast very poor hardly any healthy options no ham scrambled eggs restaurant staff very slow not attentive they asked us to sit at the bar very busy place cramed in tiny room also not enough tables for such big hotel we skipped breakfast for the remaining days they don t set the tables either our room did not get cleaned on day at all or missing toiletries or did not put sheets on extra blanket for such expensive place these few things are spoiling otherwise a very nice hotel
