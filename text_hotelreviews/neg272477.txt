the reception guys are kind but not well informed at all the first day sent us to a bike shop and told us that we would receive a discount as customers of the hotel but the shop had no clue about this offer same thing about the keukenhof gardens one told us that the hotel has an offer the other denied it another annoying thing was that they were closing the breakfast buffet earlier or exactly the indicated time i went to refill my coffee and they did not let me at last thing was that we had a hard plastic shaker and some coffee with us to make coffee at the room which went missing the first time they cleaned up our room
