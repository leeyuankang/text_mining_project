not much happening in the neighbourhood hotel restaurant way too expensive and closes early the price for this property was heavily discounted by some truth be told although it was a very comfortable hotel the originally quoted price would have been too much so if such generous discounts aren t normally available when booking well in advance i d call this property over priced breakfast is good and fresh but little variety and selection
