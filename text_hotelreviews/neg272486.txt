too much expensive i made a reservation though booking com which said the payment will have to be made directly to the property on the spot but actually the mount had been already deducted from my account i reserved the hotel for my colleague from japan therefore if the payment is reducted from my account the things would be complicated the receptonist who was nice kindly credited on the spot the amount paid the system should have been sdjusted to the booking com indication
