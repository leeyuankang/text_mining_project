the hotel is very far away from the city centre and at a walk from the closest train metro station amsterdam zuid the hotel seems to cut corners on everything and the staff could benefit from better training not having bin bags is unpleasant especially when you have kitchenette and you may want to cook something coffee tea bags milk pots dishwasher tablets toiletries were not available for the entire stay just for the first day they could have been purchased from the reception at a very expensive price for their value go to the supermarket hema situated at the ground floor of the shopping mall or bring your own it was the only hotel where i had to ask the receptionist for a toilet paper roll i asked left a message for the housekeeper but i did not receive any the breakfast was basic nothing special although the food was satisfactory the staff s attitude was not no good morning no thank you no good bye they looked at us when we left like we were nothing but a one more table to clean same with the housekeeping and receptionist disappointed oh and the hotel retained a large deposit from my debit card which was refunded two weeks after i left the hotel i did not see that mentioned on booking and i did not enjoyed having that money blocked for such a large period of time also the hotel initially took more money than mentioned on booking so be vigilant and check your bank statement they claimed they took money for the city tax but the amount did not match they refunded but i still lost money for currency exchanges overall i am disappointed and i would recommend to go to another hotel
