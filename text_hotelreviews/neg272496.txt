the breakfast is very simple the is no fried egg option on the average i give out of to breakfast hotel is far away from the center take this into account while reserving the surrounding is quite and nice area nearest metro statin is about so for shoppers i do not recommend this hotel the city center takea about depending on where you want to go price vs quality i think that you can find more balanced deals elsewhere
