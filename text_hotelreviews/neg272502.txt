element amsterdam would make a great service to their property by training their staff better one day i called the reception about misunderstanding with the cleaning personnel the reception promised to return to us but it never happened i waited for the whole evening we were put in an invalid room that was not the coziest one there were these small things said by the personnel that make you feel they wish you to be gone telling hours before check out that you can leave already when you ask whether the check out is until not asking how your stay was not showing any appreciation that you stayed for nights not providing tea bags etc in your room daily maybe there are just too many tourists in amsterdam
