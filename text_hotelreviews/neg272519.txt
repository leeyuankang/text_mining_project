i was here attending a conference at the nearby university which is mins walk away the city however is far from the hotel and if i were a tourist i would find it too far at least tram ride plus walk the city itself is beautiful and is nothing like where the hotel is located it s safe and clean but nothing much to look at i was also quite disappointed by the staff the man i checked in with could have been friendlier when checking out i asked for a taxi at when it didn t show up after i asked and was told i should wait a bit more at i asked again i was pacing in front of them and they never came to ask they made a call and i was told the taxi was stuck in traffic and should arrive in mins the taxi didn t arrive till and i was getting very nervous i spoke with the driver and i believed that the company never got a call from the hotel until i was very disappointed that they messed up my taxi booking and did not apologise for their mistake
