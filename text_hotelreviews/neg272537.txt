i didn t like how the staff wasn t very helpful at receiption not telling us how to use our room key and the elevators then at breakfast no one saw to us to explain how it worked or when we could have our breakfast it was a shame that you only were aloud one bottle of water and two coffees in your room and we were there days for the price of the hotel you would expect a bit better service we wasn t told about having to have a deposit down also so when we arrived we wasn t aloud in our room because we had spent all of our money paying for the room already to then be told they wanted another out of us so we hung around not knowing if we re going to have a hotel for our holiday although we had already spent nearly for just the room hotel was nice just a shame no one seemed like they wanted to work there and be helpful at all
