lot of dust everywhere tv table kitchenette surface coffee maker etc crumbs of food in freezer on table and so on we stayed there for nights and dust was not cleaned during our stay room service only change towels one towel was dirty on arrival and make bed soap not available in bathroom only wall fixed and broken showering gel dispenser in shower shower was leaking to bathroom so after taking it you need to mop the whole bathroom breakfast was acceptable on weekend but choice reduced on weekdays looks like management invested a lot to build good looking and comfortable hotel but personnel is ruining it for example vacuum cleaner stayed dropped in corridor for days until someone removed it
