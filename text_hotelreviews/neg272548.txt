we managed to get free bikes from the hotel great idea in amsterdam but i was unlucky to puncture a tire and got charged to replace it you can rent a bike for days and you won t be charged for a punctured tire at a rental place for for this reason i wouldn t recommend taking the free bikes from the hotel you re better off renting somewhere else may i suggest the hotel reviews this policy to truly be a wonderful place to stay
