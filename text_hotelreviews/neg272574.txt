the hotel is new and the first impression is wow however when i went for breakfast in the morning i was surprised to see that there was nothing to eat but bread grade cheese kind of ham and green melon next surprise came when i returned from work at and found out that nobody cleaned my room well i had to be very noisy at the reception to get my room s towels changed and litter bin replaced i wish they cleaned the the floor too vacuum cleaning technology hasn t come to this hotel yet mop is a dirty job for a room keeper so forget it many people commented here that the hotel has good location maybe if you go to amsterdam for shopping in a small mall with shops or to buy cheap beer from the supermarket the reality is that the nearest metro station is away fast walking and another minutes ride in the train to reach the center of the city in fact i was much faster with the bike i was lucky to get from the lobby as there are only two bikes for all guests
