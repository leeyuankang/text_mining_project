we ve made our reservation several days after the hotel was open for visitors and months prior our stay there were a lot of free rooms at our arrival we were surprised to find out that we could not have the rooms with separate beds as we have requested the girl at the reception desk explained that booking com could not guarantee that we will receive the rooms that we have asked for and that we should have made our reservation directly with them
