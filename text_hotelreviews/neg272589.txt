i have to say that the only thing that l didn t like was brekfast it is advertised as a lot of healthy options etc and l was looking forward to it but it was pretty basic and dry some bread and cheese waffles butter there was nothing green like salad tomatoes cucumbers no mayo or red sauce there was nothing available from kichen things like omelette fried egg porridge etc the only healthy thing available was two types of smoothies but they were constantly running out coffee wasnt great not bad but not good the staff and service at the brekfast was very slow tables were not cleaned quick enough to allow new people to be seated coffee machine was breaking up running out of food generally people looked frustrated as they had to wait to find a clean table and queue to get some coffee etc if l would stay there again l woud not pay for brekfast as it not my type of brekfast at all the hotel is located within shopping centre there are coffee shops and food markets to buy things
