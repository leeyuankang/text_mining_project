the bathroom if it can be called that even honestly it is just a cubicle with no demarcation for the shower just a shower curtain that you pull across but that certainly does not help as for sure there is water everywhere on the floor when you shower we had to put down towels to soak it all up as it s a mess they could surely have increased the size by cutting down on the seating area of the room it was really very tiny though we were in the club room
