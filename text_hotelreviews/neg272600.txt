the breakfast lacked healthy options no porridge and no greens berries no omelette either when i asked for greens i got a plate full of rucola with pesto strange no natural yoghurt just hard and stiff quark one morning i asked for natural yoghurt and eventually got it the other day the same member of the staff told me that quark was yoghurt that was strange and funny they should do something about airconditioning it turned on automatically every morning even though i had turned it off and i got sick as always do with aircon the fire alarm went off in the middle of the night and we were forced to go out reason a couple had prepared food and burned something maybe the stoves should be automatically turned off at pm too small trash can recycling for paper and bottles but why not for bio waste small adjustments nearly perfect hotel
