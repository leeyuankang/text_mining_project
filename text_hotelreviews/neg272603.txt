well location is a problem this hotel is far away from the city where the museums and the attractions are there should be more advice about how to get about by trams to the city the advertised bicycles did not exist which was a disappointment the restaurant in the hotel was lovely but have to say the portions were too small i had been travelling from finland and had been on the road plus than hours and i was hungry i did not return to this restaurant for that reason even that the food was lovely and service good i just needed more value for money breakfast was full of low nutrition white wheat products rolls waffles etc which i do not regard as healthy food maybe serve more foods which are not just white flour and sugar coffee was good and the cold cuts some salad and scrambled organic eggs would have been nice there were multiple false fire alarms during my stay which were quite annoying out of the bed in the middle of the night is not my idea of relaxing hotel night still thank goodness the alarms were false
