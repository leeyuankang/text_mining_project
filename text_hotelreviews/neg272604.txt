parking although it is in a mall and they are negotiating with the mall to have use of their car park facilities i am disabled with a blue card so i was able to park across the road but you can use the car park to unload as there is an entrance to the hotel in there and then you can park a couple of minutes walk away at frieslandstraat accessible bathroom i would have liked to have seen a fold up seat in there as i cannot use my own wheelchair in the shower i suggested to the staff that they may wish to review the heavy sliding mirrored door to the wet room difficult enough for my able bodied daughter to open someone with dexterity problems would have a nightmare of a time opening and closing it i have a little gripe about the food don t get me wrong the food is superb even though the menu is fairly limited it is super quality food my gripe is that after a busy day travelling or sightseeing one is tired and hungry the beautifully presented food is very chic and therein lies the problem i think the portions are too small starters are euros and mains are euros i wouldn t mind paying a little more and having a bigger meal
