one of the rooms booked had sky bar bills charged to the room on one evening we all used cash throughout the holiday and charged nothing to the room at any point clearly the bar staff do not ask for the room id card when charging otherwise this could have been avoided this was embarrassing when checking out and not a pleasant way to remember the weekend
