we booked the hotel because although we knew it was primarily a gay hotel it did say heterosexual friendly and the photos on booking com were inviting enough we booked our hotel at a non refundable price and later in the week when we visited the website we noticed it was full of sexual photos naked men etc clearly not the same photos on bookings com we tried to cancel through the hotel and bookings as we believed this was false advertisement we did not receive a favorable response from either party and we were not willing to lose over so we chose to stay at check in our room was not ready even though we arrived after the lights did not work properly and we actually had to turn certain lights on and off through a fuse box the rooms were noisy and one night were woke up to the smell of pot and a snake alarm going off we will not stay here again
