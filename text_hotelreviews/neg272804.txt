the bed was uncomfortable and noisy from am there were noises from construction which would last for hours so it was impossible to take a rest between pm the spa was not included in hotel rates room design was a real dislike at all other hotels when we had problem with the noises in room we would get a new room at least with one day delay at axel hotel despite of my continuous complains it didn t happen they tried to fix the issue and keep us in the same room they changed the bed so it was less noisy but the noises from am onwards was always there until our last day i believe that the rating is somehow biased as not so many hetero couples stay in this hotel the atmosphere especially in the sky bar was not right for a hetero couple
