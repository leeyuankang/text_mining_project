the hotel restaurant was in renovation during our stay so the breakfast were served in a nearby cafe tasty and fresh but no buffet may not suit to those to like big first meal of the day you have to pay extra for the spa that was an unpleasant suprise for us later we ve checked the info on booking com and there is a small note on the bottom of the hotels page easy to miss when booking
