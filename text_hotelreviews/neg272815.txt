being a regular guest at the axel hotel in berlin i knew what to expect the house music in the lobby the rather tacky interior design the muscled and half naked men on each leaflet they all are part of the axel brand it serves mainly the mainstream gay male audience and welcomes straight guests as well but axel hotel barcelona seems to lose focus on their main clientele a bit the urban spa is ran by a different company and has to be paid extra so it isn t part of the hotel anymore extremely prudish staff there is rather off putting the skybar on the rooftop has a beautiful sight over the city and is quite busy on the weekends too unfortunately the advertising of events doesn t always correlate with the event itself a bit more attention to details there might help all in all still a great experience and a good value for your money
