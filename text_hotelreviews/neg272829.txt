we were there for the weekend and bar staff on roof top pool were unfriendly and incredibly slow with so few customers the breakfast buffet was very good but hardly anyone eats at this very nice restaurant morning or evening even though the hotel was full i don t know why the axel hotels don t provide wash cloths sponge for the showers same in berlin and just like in berlin the showers pour water onto the bathroom floor because the shower glass was installed incrorrectly in both locations i d definitely stay at axel berlin again but not barcelona its bar staff at the pool were unfriendly and rude and they close the pool and jacuzzi at and that s where everyone gathers and where we spent most of our time and money when not sightseeing or clubbing
