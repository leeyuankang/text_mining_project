even though we booked the more expensive version of paying upon arrival whole amount was charged to my card anyways and returned next day since i had different currency on my account that s why i chose not paying via card i lost eur in conversion rates overnight so i payed more to get a certain service and i did not get it anyways booking com placement stipulates many times that the card will not be charged and that was one of the considerations when i am making a decision
