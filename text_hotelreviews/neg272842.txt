i was not aware that this was a gay hotel and although this did not affect my evaluation i think that this should have been apparent on the booking com website the hotel website has been updated since this was booked the details in the hotel stated that the spa was for gay persons only i did not challenge this but this is sexist and again was not apparent not the website whether you can prove this i don t know
