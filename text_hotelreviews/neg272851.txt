the bed was like sleeping on a sheet of plywood it s an extremely firm mattress our requests for extra pillows were ignored the requests were treated with respect just never answered or acted upon no extra blankets either there is almost zero storage for any clothing so my suitcase just had to sit on the floor there isn t even a rack for holding a suitcase so you have to crouch down to deal with it in the shower there s no place to put anything even the little bar of soap so shampoo and everything was on the floor i guess they take the minimalist design very seriously breakfast was convenient but dull with eggs that were very overcooked after sitting around for a while i don t think i would stay there again it wasn t awful just not what i would expect for the price they re banking on being a gay destination hotel
