quality of room finishing a is poor with a bad smell when we checked in rooftop pool spa had no atmosphere with no music breakfast provided at the hotel is very average despite being a renound hotel the experience did not live up to the hype a distinct lack of atmosphere continuity and social areas in the hotel left us disappointed in the experience
