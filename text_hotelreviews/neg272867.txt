this hotel neglects to mention just how in your face it is as a male gay hotel as a lesbian couple even we felt uncomfortable at the explicitness of it from the moment you walk into the hotel even in your room this would have been fine if it was disclosed transparently on booking com and perhaps was a generic lgbt hotel they have great facilities roof top bar spa gym but we simply didn t use them having been put off by the whole demeanour of the hotel wifi is horrendous so don t expect good usage all the time
