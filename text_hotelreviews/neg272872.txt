i have been at this hotel and at other axel hotels several time but this time was definitely the last time room air condition didn t work water in basis didn t run through disgusting no shower towels wake up call forgotten reception didn t handle complaint properly from check until check out staff was impolite and arrogant breakfast very basic and less quality and quantity than before i am traveling through out the year a lot and can recommend to book other hotels in barcelona for less money and better quality and service
