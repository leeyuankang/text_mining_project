this was my second stay after years at axel sadly i got hugely disappointed this time reception staff were constantly head down on their screens throughout our stay of days and nights never attentive or genuinely interested in helping even when there was no one queueing we had to wait for the reception guy to finish his so important and never ending thing every single time breakfast was seriously bad they charge you extra even for basic fried eggs coffee was the worst we paid for a premium double room yet still asked to be charged per head for every single spa access rooftop pool is basically an oversized bath tub apart from one guy the whole house keeping was shambolic one day we left one of the hand towels on the floor to be changed instead they took both of the towels along with the floor towel without replacing them with fresh ones bathroom got semi flooded and we obviously had to wait until the next day as there is no house keeping after in other words it all comes down to the management which is simply taking advantage of its gay selling point
