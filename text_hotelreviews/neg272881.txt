the customer service at the pool and bar was absolutely terrible worst service i have ever received no english tv channels needs much better customer service we asked for the tv to be fixed as the channels were all fuzzy due to ariel connection and was told they would log it and maybe would be fixed the following day they need to accommodate the hotel guests as much as they accommodate the non hotel guests at the sky bar pool bar room deodorizer for the hotel foyer smells like a gay sauna as soon as you walk in
