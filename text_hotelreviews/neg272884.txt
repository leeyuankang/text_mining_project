on check in clerk begins selling upgraded room which i refuse first room terrible windowless overlooking inner smoking atrium dark and smoky immediately return to frontdesk to enquire about the upgrade and am told since i used a towel i can t change rooms until the following day constantly overheard receptionists trying to sell upgraded rooms to arriving guests rooftop is crowded drinks significantly overpriced barstaff not the most attentive minutes to get a drink on a crowded friday night while bartenders doing shots with friends corridors elevators dirty and need cleaning and updating minibar charged but not used hotel needs a good refreshing as it seems to be relying on its reputation rather than making an earnest effort at providing high quality four star accommodations
