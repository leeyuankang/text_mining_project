this hotel is a cheater with terrible staff and management i booked a premium room to this hotel and they gave me a regular one when we asked for a change they said to come next day when we get there next day we should come earlier next day after arguing more than half an hour with an arrogant receptionist when we able to talk with some in charge they said the pictures of premium room in booking selected by an agency and they will change it i waited to write this appraisal two weeks if there was a real misunderstanding or they were cheating on tourists i saw that there is not any change be careful about this hotel finally when they changed the room it was obvious that the room i paid times greater than the ones they had me to stay there was not any money refund or apology they caused me almost half a day for everything it was one the worst hotel experience i have ever had
