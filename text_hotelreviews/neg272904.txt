this is a gay people hotel booking website did not inform us that it is a hotel specifically for gay people where sexual pictures and nude guys pictures are all over the lobby elevators rooms and everywhere the hotel is not as per standard for a stars hotel at all the place smelled bad and the furniture was old the entire time i felt that the place is very dirty one of my billow has stains breakfast was not good at all and the cancellation is for two nights shows that they get a high probability of people wanting to cancel thier reservation wanted an iron one night and they told me they ran out of irons i actually was eager to check out as soon as possible
