the rooms are not great value for the money they re okay and the beds are comfortable but there is no closet space and the bathroom is a bad design there is no housekeeping service after a glass broke in my room and the desk manager offered to give me a broom so i could sweep up the glass myself the breakfast was horrible the whole gay hotel seems to have been designed by some tasteless straight interior decorator thinking that they know what gay men like so that they could capture the gay dollar because no gay man designed it it s just poor all the way around
