hours after settling the final bill at the reception upon checking out i received a notification from my bank stating that an extra amount was charged over my credit card by the hotel i wrote to the hotel to inquiry and they replied to me saying that the cleaning staff has found missing items in the mini fridge i wrote back to them stating that i haven t used the mini bar at all during my stay but the hotel wrote back insisted that the items was missing and i should incur the charges hours after checking out i didn t make a big deal out of it because the amount charged wasn t big however this ruined any good experience i had in the hotel
