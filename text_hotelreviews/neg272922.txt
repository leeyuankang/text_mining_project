they call themselves gay hotel so why do gays have to run away from drunk and very aggressive straight russians with their girlies and several bottles of hooch in the whirlpool this happened twice on two days before they shut down the pool sorry for the inconvenience obviously policies stop here at money too breakfast is simply a joke coffee and tea are cold and just undrinkable bread is dry like sawdust fried eggs voil sign it before you eat it the smell in the bath is overwhelming you ll need a good stomach and forget to sleep beds are hard as wood and the motor of the whirlpool is running the whole night above your head we measured it decibel though we think that most of customers stay there for other reasons and to spend as always too much money
