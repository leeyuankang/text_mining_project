staff at the hotel have a lot to learn from their intern have not experienced such a condescending attitude and unprofessional service for a very long time the room was not ready on arrival it was being checked when got the room it was prepared for one despite several calls and reminders to get the missing towel etc these arrived only the next day and so on will not be staying there again by the way the spa costs extra
