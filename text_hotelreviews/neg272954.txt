the hotel needs renovation on the lower floors this has begun and so the hotel may be in better shape in a few months the fittings in the room are all getting a bit shabby and need repair the maid service is rudimentary and they should do better leaving dust on the floor in full sight is just sloppy the bar is nothing special but seems to be quite popular the television is very limited in other axel hotels there are movies and series to watch or rent here nothing except basic cable the idea that there is a charge for the spa if you don t book a treatment is kind of astounding at the normal rack rates that is unacceptable
