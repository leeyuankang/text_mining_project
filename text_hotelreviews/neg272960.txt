i booked for a big bedroom for as we were a couple and they gave us a two small beds put in together we couldn t even sleep together because the beds will split apart at the moment we move we tryed to get changed the room but they told us that i had to pay more it s not about the money but i booked a matrimonial bedroom and already payed for it the internet connection was very poor the room oldfashioned style i mean maybe this hotel was chic at the s but come on guys we re already and for the prices you ve got for a night i can get better rooms and the worst thing ever is to see how dirty are the carpet on the aisle on the way to the rooms awful
