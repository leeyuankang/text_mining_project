when asked for an extra cover as it was cold at night they said they could not offer me another i had a hard time sleeping as i was cold cover was on the thin side partner pulls for himself all night i thought asking for an additional cover would be a simple request but apparently for them this was unheard of the staff at the spa gym were extremely annoying and we did not feel welcome when interacting with them breakfast was poorly served and unappetizing we were charged for an upgrade to our room and received a room with literally a brick wall view this hotel is in desperate need for a renovation the facilities look dated and old
