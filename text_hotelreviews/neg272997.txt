to low staffed in peak hours both in reception and in the sky bar running out of wine one day and not solve it either same day or latest to the day after is not what i expect from a hotel where i pay this much for the hotel and for the wine maintenance of the hotel is disappointing a bit run down i would say jacuzzi only partly functioning roof top terrace and the sun chairs are run down move of the experienced waiters from axel to the new hotel have changed the atmosphere to the worse
