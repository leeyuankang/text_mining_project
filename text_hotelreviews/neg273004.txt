i have never left a review before we travel a lot but are quite busy and unfortunately don t take the time to review places we stay at this time i have to for nights in a standard room quite pricey i thought but the pictures of this hotel looked awesome it was horrible ripped bed sheets wall paper peeling off everywhere bathroom dirty and the bed my fiancee has bad back problems which didn t help but even myself no back problems slept horribly and woke up super stiff the next morning we approached andy at the reception straight after we checked in but the hotel was fully booked and nobody showed any interest of how miserable our room was i couldn t cancel anymore and it was too late to search for another hotel but the next day we left and cut our holiday in barcelona a day short checked out although we had already paid for another night no further comment at the reception nobody made any effort to make up for anything refund or even just nice words
