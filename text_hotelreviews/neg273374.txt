since this was a hotel me and my partner assumed the service etc would be excellent especially in light that we had the best suite in the hotel however we were treated like we could not afford the room hotel and was looked down on by the majority of the staff when we went to the hotel restaurant a main reason why i booked the hotel we were ushered out with no alternative for dinner many items in the room were broken for example the phone did not work and had come off of its stand which meant we could not call for room service even when we went to ask for breakfast to be delivered to our room we were just told to get breakfast and carry it down by ourselves defeating the point of room service we found several birthday decorations in and under the bed from previous customers which would be disgusting to find in a cheaper hotel never mind this one there were also many scuffs around the room bathroom and jacuzzi bath in the suite and the shower had a very poor drainage system which meant our clothes got soaked in the bathroom very little care had been taken to the small details in the room this hotel would have been somewhere we went yearly if it wasn t for the absolutely astonishing staff and customer service
