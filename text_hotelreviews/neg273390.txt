star hotel you expect certain items included in the price there wasn t any kettle tea or coffee included in room nor was there any bottled water unless you take from the mini bar per small bottle hotel is really nice although is starting to look worn in areas however nothing major rooms great and staff excellent pool would have been much better if heated as no one could use it due to it been far to cold heaters on the roof top terence would have been a great touch and made the evenings more enjoyable while relaxing before heading out went last july and the evenings were warm so it was noticeable then however may the evenings was still rather chilly
