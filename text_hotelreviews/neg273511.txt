the only down side to this hotel is that despite being convenientely close to the train station for quick acccess to the airport and downtown and also to the tram station its still a minute walk that with amsterdam very changing weather it can mean you could get very wet as we did also as you wonder around amsterdam center and buy things it could be conveniente to have a close hotel nearby to drop stuff off and keep exploring in this case going back to the hotel and back would be a little to far away yet we did love the hotel and it is much cheaper than most of the options downtown so if you dont mind the commute this hotel is for you
