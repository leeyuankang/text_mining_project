the communication from the hotel was really poor things wasn t said that was really important such as they will reserve money on your credit card and if it didn t go through they cancel your booking without letting you know they should keep contact with guests in such instances the housekeeping is not up to standard we did get clean towels but the beds were unmade and dishes left in the room give the impression that they do not care the dining room area and smoking area is not maintained during the day night when there is no service should have cleaner s to make sure that everything is clean and up to scratch the parking is available but would cost an extra per day
