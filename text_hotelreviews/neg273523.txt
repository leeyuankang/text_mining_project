the breakfast was disappointing in that the staffing levels were poor with dirty plates etc left uncollected at our table during the meal and all around us at nearby tables fed this back to management and some improvement made but still poor in view of price paid for the stay wanted to dine on night one but there was a notice saying the restaurant would not be open very poor and no compensation offered
