staff are helpful but at times a bit disinterested which can be frustrating when you re jet lagged that said management responds promptly to concerns and makes a concerted effort to fix things which abates this it would be nice to avoid this in the first place however when booking a double room you expect to get a double bed if is annoying to be given two single beds grouped together and have to specifically ask for a double bed again a small complaint
