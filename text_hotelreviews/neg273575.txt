after my third stay at this hotel i observe how the standards and the quality of service are getting lower rooms are less clean sheets and towels are old and over used need to be replaced the property management needs to keep up to the rating and first day quality service and need to pay more attention to cleanliness and facilities to keep the customers coming back to this otherwise great hotel
