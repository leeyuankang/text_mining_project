the hotel is run by teenagers in their gym is very minimalist the space available would easily allow for a few more useful equipment so it s obviously a lack of willing the moto a hotel for urban cow boys is hard to witness in the property it s pure marketing with nothing behind the restaurant is not open till an expensive hostel to me
