slightly disappointed that not much english tv available bbc iplayer appeared but didn t work in practice not suitable if you want to walk around in the evening or find other restaurants or entertainment nearby do that first then come back to hotel or go into town again was no problem for us as found it truly relaxing and restaurant excellent
