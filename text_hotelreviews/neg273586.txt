location is inconvenient far from the city center and in a rather criminal district my car s window was smashed and some belongings stolen at the nearby parking suggested by the hotel the hotel occupies floor of multistory appartments building and the rooms are very small there are only two beds and nothing else suggested with discount the price for room was the same as for novotel but the quality and location is beyond even minimum standards
