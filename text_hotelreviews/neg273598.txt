i handed in clothing at reception on time for them to be delivered for laundry i was told that i would get my clean clothing hours later over hours later i called reception only to be told that there had been miscommunication between the morning shift staff and night staff and that my clothing had not been laundered during the hour period no one called me to tell me to get my clothing i assume all staff saw the laundry bag lying there but did nothing about it this was sorely disappointing and an inconvenience to me the location is a bit out of town for its price
