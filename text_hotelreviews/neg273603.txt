restaurant offerings a little bland but more than acceptable to eat after a long flight there is a restaurant between the railway station and the hotel that looked quite nice although intermittent opening hours the bret pub next to the railway station had a great selection of local beers and nice menu would recommend this over the hotel restaurant
