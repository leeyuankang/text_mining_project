housekeeping housekeeping housekeeping when we checked in our room was clean but the next nights showed how unprofessional and vindictive their housekeeping services can be on our second night back at the hotel room after a long day we found the toilet bowl and cover filled with dirt hair and blackish water my husband had to use the brush and clean the toilet himself we complained to the hotel manager veronika who was nice enough to have a chat with us she apologised and graciously offered a token meal and assured us she would have a word with the housekeeping supervisor but our stay continued to be ruined by more housekeeping woes as their behaviour became very vindictive when it came to cleaning our room the very next day housekeeping very messily made up our bed we found dirt and hair on our pillows which indicated that they threw the pillows on the floor while making the bed again the following day we found the pillows placed on the tables instead of on our bed
