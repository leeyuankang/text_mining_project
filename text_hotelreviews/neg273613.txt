the staff at the property were extremely rude they were young inexperienced and lacked the professionalism that is required to treat guests at a four star property there seemed to have been an attitude of you pay so we don t care mentality which i suppose comes with a lack of proper training in customer relations the rooms were also not cleaned properly according to four star standards in the end we had to cut our stay short the manager was very helpful in this regard however and promised to speak to her staff regarding the treatment of guests
