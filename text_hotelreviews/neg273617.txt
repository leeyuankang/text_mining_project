the room was a bit tight but it fit all of us adults kids they had a really neat bunk bed that the kids loved and the beds were actually really comfortable we were able to open the window for a nice breeze and fresh air and the location it isn t super busy for traffic so the noise level was not a bother and we all had great sleeps
