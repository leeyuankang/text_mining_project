unfortunately it was not a perfect stay for us the electric kettle was very dirty and i could wipe dust and mould from it i had to request for an exchange which they did but this kettle was worse there were black stuff stuck at the bottom refer to photo i ended up exchanging it again to find that they had no clean kettle my advise is to check your kettle before using it the toilet bowl looked great but kind of clogged up after a day of light usage luckily they fixed it the next day it s a fun and unique hotel but i really think that it could easily have been a perfect star experience without the issues faced
