room temperature was too low tried first adjusting controls then complained and it finally got fixed then next day it was too low again seems the temperature controls constantly reset to some specific setting c which did not really correspond to true temperature the special requests i made while booking the hotel apparently got lost and were never responded to it was extremely windy during our stay up to and hotel is in an area where the wind will catch you the window glasses are not particularly soundproof so one could definitely hear the wind howling during nights which would somehow be more tolerable if room temperature was ok curiously there was no do not disturb sign one could hang on the door not having this always makes me uncomfortable almost got stuck in elevator once door did not close properly and it got stuck between floors forced the door shut and the elevator got to correct floor luckily wasn t the girlfriend there she probably wouldn t have had enough force to close it apparently this was due to a broken button in the elevator which they already knew about
