perhaps it was better the hotel to clearly state that the taxi fare will be hectic about euro while by train it will be euro from the airport because the website says it will be about minutes both by taxi and train i chose taxi which was a big mistake as soon as the driver said it was euro i immediately said please turn back but he said it was too late arrived at the hotel with an unpleasant feeling the stay itself was fabulous want to come back again
