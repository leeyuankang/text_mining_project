lovely hotel staff all very friendly free teas and coffees for all guests in the lounge area location is good a minute walk followed by a minute train ride from the centre if you are looking to stay out late tho the trains only run until ish and sometimes are changed to busses which isn t easy to see on the signs aprox taxi to airport centre or for a day amsterdam public transport pass would recommend for families couples or friends who are looking for a quiet and relaxing break
