i d booked a family room for adults one of which dropped out thank god he did as the room was a bit cramped between people so i couldn t have imagined what it would have been like with also it said single beds and a bunk bed the bunk bed was actually a sofa bed folded out which was uncomfortable and cramped after a certain time you cannot order food drink the bar is only open from around so if you like a late drink back at the hotel this would not suit also as it s quite a bit out from the main city there isn t many places to get food either
