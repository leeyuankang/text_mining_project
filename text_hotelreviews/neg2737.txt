the room was tiny to put this into perspective we are two yr old females who have travelled quite a bit and have used various standards of accomadation from hostels upwards so it s not like we re accustomed to luxury i ve also been in london a number of times so i understand hotel rooms are small in general knowing this we paid a bit extra for a deluxe double as it was supposed to have more room but the bed was a standard double in size and there was only bare walking room on one side and at the end and you could just about stand on the other side of it we actually found it massively amusing trying to figure out what was deluxe about the room
