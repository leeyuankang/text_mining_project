i definitely wouldn t give this hotel a four star rating the breakfast is awful worst iv ever had and they tried to charge us twice for it the cleaner broke a bottle of expensive foundation when she was cleaning our room and left a note saying sorry when i complained about this she tried to say i broke it myself and she found it on the floor even though i had let her into the room myself when we were leaving and obviously everything was fine i was reimbursed for it but it s still ridiculous and an inconvenience having no make up for two days there is nothing in the area around the hotel bar or restaurant wise so you don t have the option of not going into the centre expensive for an average hotel outside of the centre area
