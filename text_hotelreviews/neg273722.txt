the family room was in fact a normal room where the so called seating area that it should ve had was in fact the sofabed that was converted to bunkbed for the children so in fact there was no seating area contrary to the description hardly any space to walk in the room yet the price was that of a family room i e a room fit for a family the bunk bed squeaked with the slightest movement so all night every time my kid moved and since we were sleeping a meter away this kept us all up we could literally follow the conversation of the neighbours also all night the toilets in the lobby were as bad as to be expected along the highway and it s not even in a nice neighborhood but completely outside of the city all this for euro for night
