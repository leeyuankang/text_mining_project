breakfast buffet had good food but choices limited from what i could see there was nothing else much around the hotel eg restaurants stores residential business area very quiet which was nice but not the best location since you have to take the train or rent a bike to get anywhere price was the highest i have ever paid for a hotel room and the ul is nice but not posh i guess what they charge is reasonable for a dam but that s why i rate it lower in terms of value for money better deals in other cities we liked rotterdam better but if you really want to go to a dam this is a good choice
