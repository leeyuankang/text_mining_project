receptionist young female was very rude when i checked in she said i would have to prepay i asked if she needed a credit card to guarantee payment she said no i needed to pay upfront i said this was very unusual so she argued it was normal in holland i explained i had been staying in hotels in holland for over years and never had to pay up front she said she wouldn t know she was not that old meaning not as old as me i left a complaint for the manager but never received the promised call back in my opinion this person should not be in reception or anywhere in the public domain shame because the hotel is well located but there is plenty of choice in the area so i would suggest marriott holiday inn or any of the other hotels close by
