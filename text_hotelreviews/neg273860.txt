quite far from the city center need or min walk to bus or tram stop then min bus or tram ride to the center but still counts as convenient we stayed in a family room on the ground floor i don t know if it s the drain problem or what but the bathroom was constantly filled with bad smell and the air vent worked not particularly good the room is also pretty small for adults
