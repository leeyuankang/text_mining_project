location was the biggest minus hotel restaurant menu was rather poor although quality of the food was ok the gym could be bigger and maybe some sauna there was definitely enough space to fit some more facilities also i wasnt happy with the room cleaning it was way too basic they would not even take empty bottles or empty rubbish there was no minibar option in the morning you could hear the traffic from the main road
