stay would have been quite nice except i was in a tandem room shared door leading to another room with unrelated guests door was closed and locked but other guests were apparently smoking heavily while i slept when i woke up the next morning i was immediately coughing because so much smoke was coming through walls door all my clothing smelled of smoke i am not exaggerating also the guests next to me woke up vomiting and continued to vomit for about minutes while i got ready i could hear them very clearly since i was checking out first thing in the morning i didn t bother asking to be moved but it was very unpleasant
