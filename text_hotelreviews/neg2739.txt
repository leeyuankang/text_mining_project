reception staff very poor service not friendly not helpful i feel we got fooled with a few things only because the staff in the reception didn t inform us about things like if you prebook your breakfast at the reception the day before is only not more as we got charged when we went down in the restaurant if you ask them to call you a cab they call you a private kind of a chauffeur service which is more expensive then the usual london cabs etc we booked a room for people in a small room there was a double bed and a very uncomfortable sofa one of us had to sleep on that on the sofa also had a few issues with the charges on my credit card in the hotel they were not helpful they didn t give me any explanation they gave me an email to email them i wouldn t trust them again with my credit card
