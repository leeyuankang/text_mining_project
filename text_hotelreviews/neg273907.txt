dreadful experience at breakfast only one small coffee machine working and not continously and staff not bothering helping guests very much result minutes line to get a coffee and very nervous people all around umbelievable that hotel management did not look for an emergency solution by for instance getting their staff to serve coffee directly at tables of moving other coffee machines into the breakfast hall
