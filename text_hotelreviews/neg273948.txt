when arriving at train station difficult to pull suitcases over brick sidewalks be sure to pack light you might be disturbed if trying to sleep late in the morning because both mornings between am we heard a loud strange squeaking noise and discovered it was probably the wheels on something the maid was pushing around the nearby rooms for cleaning breakfast was too expensive for us have coffee tea in your room and bring food to keep in your fridge and wait until you get into the city for lunch
