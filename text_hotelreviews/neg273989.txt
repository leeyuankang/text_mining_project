this is the first time i found that the reviews didn t correspond to the location hotel just opened apparently which is why i don t understand how it can have so many comments and such a good score the menu in the restaurant was very limited and printed on an paper there was a bucket with cleaning stuff left next to lifts was there when i arrived and was there when i left there was no remote control for the tv in the room no bottle of water in the room just a vending machine downstairs it is these small details that make the difference
