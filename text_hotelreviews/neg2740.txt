wish the rooms were a bit bigger we booked a triple room they gave us the one facing the back of the hotel which was very claustrophobic it was so bad we were going to leave the hotel but then they showed us their other triple room which faces the front street of the hotel and that was much better but generally very claustrophobic rooms my teenage kids didn t like it as they need their space
