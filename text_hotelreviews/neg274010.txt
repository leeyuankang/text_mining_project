i think things will get better as time goes on there was quite a bit of construction and remodelling still going on so it was a bit noisy although not in the rooms i think the bathroom could use a few extra towel hooks close to the shower but the shower itself was heavenly we just came from berlin where bicycles were per day to rent so i think if the bicycle rental price here was cheaper that would be a really good thing
