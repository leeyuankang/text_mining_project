the hotel is not central however it is fairly easy to get to the city centre train metro bus and tram stations are close by we got a citycard which does not include train tickets and therefore we used to go to the city centre by bus usually number or by tram number depending on our destination it took approx min the trip would be much faster if done by train i d say minutes we didn t feel the location as being a negative point at all but since someone might we decided to list it as such
