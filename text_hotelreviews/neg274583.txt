staff at reception were unpleasant unhelpful poorly behaved and simply rude there was one man in particular who was unprofessional and rude because the room card was not working to get access to the lift in front of lots of other guests in he reception area he gave an attitude and with an intimidating tone said the lift would work only if you know how to use the key he knew very well that i went to reception repeatedly after attempting at least times and had asked someone to check the card and needed help as i had a flight to catch rooms were tiny and toilet was separate from the bathroom with no washbasin no proper wardrobe in the room glad that i was only stayed night the buffet breakfast was awful and did not cater for those who were strict vegetarians or for religious reasons could not have pork for example the vegetarian foods were kept next to pork and so other guests were using the same servings spoon for pork and vegetarian dishes the pork i e pork sausages were getting mixed with the veg dishes although it is not strictly the staffs fault but if the food were kept in separate areas then it would have prevented guests from mixing the spoons of spilling dropping pork sausages on vegetarian food in the end i ended up walking miles early morning to have breakfast at hilton the hotel has no concierge or anyone to help with the luggage when checking in or out this really is a budget hotel which i am not used to because apart from staying at novotel wien city in vienna i have always stayed at a star hotel so it was a real shock to what i am normally used to i only stayed at the hotel because i wanted to be close to my friends who were also staying at the same hotel if anyone is considering this hotel be prepared to sleep in a tiny room with very little space around the bed and the awful staff at reception it is not good value for money
