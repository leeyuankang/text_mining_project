we would never stay again lots of bad things about this place we ordered room service on the evening we arrived hoping to eat and get out to see some of vienna we requested hot water to heat the kids food to be brought before and were told no problem it would be straight away over an hour later nothing eventually after calling again the food arrived and was a disgrace the burgers were burnt both of them someone had scrapped the burnt parts from the bun and put them back on the plate despite taking over an hour when we were promised minutes the food was burnt but cold we complained and weren t offered a replacement the attitude was that we wouldn t be charged but no apology or offer of prompt replacement so asked to speak to a manager it was over hours before a manager got back to us we had to call twice more and in the end the response was to leave an apple and a small box of chocolates in the room as an apology too little and too late in addition the room was small and was not cleaned to a good standard we found hairs in the beds and on the towels that were not ours the sink in the bathrooms blocked the shower alternated between very hot and very cold overall a terrible stay and very poor standard for the price
