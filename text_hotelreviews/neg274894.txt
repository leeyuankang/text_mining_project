i was freezing in the room old windows leaking cold air in inefficient and noisy heating system apart from sauna fitness room i saw no other extra service which would justify the stars hotel seems understaffed claimed services valet service cosmetic service etc are available when you work for it queue and declare need at reception well in advance only one staff member at the reception at all times multitasking at breakfast utilities were often missing i had to wait ask the staff to bring clean mugs cutleries superior single room had the basic of the basics amenities actually just mediocre quality soap shampoo body lotion but no shower cap no cosmetics kit no toothbrush and toothpaste no shoe polish only a bare sponge or even a pen only pencil no free mineral water or anything complimentary upon arrival this is max stars service maybe i am wrong but i also suspect that they call all their single rooms superior only one pillow too soft and flat to sleep on cleaning could be more careful i noticed that the bed decor cover was dirty i placed it folded on the floor in the hope that the cleaning staff would replace it instead after cleaning i found it thrown on the back of the chair without replacement some bread crumbs remained days on the table after one day s cleaning i intentionally did not remove them myself overall i am disappointed and will not return the hotel seems obsessed with the design art side the lucky guest is offered to buy expensive art items that decorate the room and seems to put less effort in giving a service worthy to stars i have left them extensive written comments at the end of the stay and have not received any reaction since
