that was the worst stay i ever had in my life the stuff are too rude they charged me euros because i smoke in the room and i m not smoking they convinced me that the will just block the amount from my credit card till the investigate and once i checked out the deduct the amount i have tried to contact them and they never reply back the room is too small and it smells bad but i think that s their strategy to force guests to pay the smoking penalty even if you aren t smoking no one from the management their only one person at the front desk and he s not professional at all based on my stay i don t recommend that hotel at all you will spoil your stay
