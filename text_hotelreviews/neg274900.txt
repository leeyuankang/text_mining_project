the hotel was meant to be a star i would say it was a poor star the beds are lumpy we left the room at the cleaner was outside the room after we left she restocked the mini bar and then did no cleaning when we return at she decided she would like to clean the room obviously she was waiting for me to tell her it didn t matter i went downstairs for a bottle of wine they wanted for a local wine the cheapest was just a little high the hair dryer couldn t have dried a tea bag not as there was one or a kettle the tv had news channels in english but did have a small selection of normal films for just just over priced poor comfort very disappointing
