we had a lot of difficulty in controlling the room temperature it was often too hot or too cold and was very hard to find a middle range which meant we regularly resorted to opening the window with the heating on full blast the bathroom of this suite was an awkward galley style which was very long and narrow with dual sinks the shower was powerful with easily adjustable heads and water temperature was easy to control wifi was somewhat patchy around the hotel and often prone to dropout in the room but the speed of connection was not slow and there was a shared user pass for everyone staying
