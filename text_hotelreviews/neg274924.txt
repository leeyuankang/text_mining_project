rooms did not come with amenities such as ironing board and iron when asked the first time staff was fine when asked the time staff was rude and said there are many other guests who need the ironing board and iron we would not be able to use at the time for a star hotel i would assume every room would have a ironing board and iron wifi was super spotty when asked why i was kicked off after multiple times i was told was to wait and then the front desk hung up ac did not work and was asked to leave the windows open our room was over the courtyard and was super noisy at night so it was hard to get a good nights rest we were told that the ac kicks in at a certain temp funny on our last night the most chilly night our ac was blowing super cold air i do not recommend this hotel there are plenty of other options that will provide much better service
