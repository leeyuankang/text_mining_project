extremely rude staff at reception they blocked me from using my room account which i did not want to use anyway so i did not care then asked for my passport in case i used it i replied that i could not possibly use it as i am blocked and so i want to keep my passport after minutes they realised but not before rudeness them murmerring under their breath and general inhospitable behaviour
