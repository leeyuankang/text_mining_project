could have been just our room being that it was in the corner facing the courtyard on the first floor but each day from the break of dawn until midnight we heard loud bass from the sound system in their courtyard restaurant funny enough it was only soft jazz music the bass was simply too strong and must have reverberated into our corner i hope they can fix that
