i was in first floor room every morning i felt dry nose lips we find out the last days that whatever you leave on the table it is full of dust in morning we can t know from where this dust is coming as it is winter and windows are closed we suspect from the heating ducts i had no time to complain when i left the last day as i was in a hurry but this problem has to be solved for future guests
