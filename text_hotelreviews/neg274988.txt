most appalling was the condition of the floor in the room it was visibly dirty the bed was uncomfortable and did not constitute a mattress it made sleeping difficult the room was extremely even by euro standards small i believe i was assigned a room smaller than what i signed up for and the price of us dollars for nights was ridiculous for the size lack of cleanliness also breakfast was not even included
