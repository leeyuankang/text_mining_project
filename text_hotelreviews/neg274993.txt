this is no directly conected with hotel but wiena is turned upside down by trafic works mostly on main streets without any sugestion how to find your destination my gps was gone crazy we were just circuling around about one hour in total trafic nightmare also parking is to expensive per day is far to much if you have more time to investigate you can find appartments with free parking
