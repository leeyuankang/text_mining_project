we had rooms one room no had ants crawling in the room the last night the second room no had a electricity issue we had to wait several hours until to be able to sleep finally at we entered the room without any air condition the temperature was c and we were not able to sleep the hotel was not able to give us another room they said there is one room no which is free but the door lock has a problem the hotel director was only able to deduct eur at first but after arguments he raised it to eur by the way he did not want to speak to us directly but communicated with the receptionist only he argued that it is not their fault but due to technical aspects they do not find it necessary to compensate with more the breakfast buffet is at budget level quality the dairy products are displayed in room temperature imagine that you want yogurt and eat it warm the cereal is of cheap quality and the coffee machine stops often due to low capacity and people need to wait and call the staff for assistance also there is always something missing on the table if you ask for coffee cups it comes without saucers and spoon you need to ask for napkin or if you have omelet the fork is missing etc etc the hotel is not really a stars quality level and definitely not a boutique hotel we did not enjoy our stay at all
