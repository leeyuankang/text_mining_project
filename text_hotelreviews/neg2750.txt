i booked a double deluxe room here online but when i got there they gave me a small room the size of a closet because it was available first even though i had paid the price point for a double deluxe room pounds a night they then transferred me to a slightly bigger room that still wasn t a double deluxe and looked nothing like in the pictures staff were rude and reluctant to help whenever spoken to and at one point in the lounge area we witnessed one of the staff giving a young hotel guest a loud and stern lecture about payment the whole exchange was very uncomfortable and unprofessional for pounds night canadian dollars we would have gotten a spacious room in other countries with wonderful service but here i felt like i had thrown a bunch of money down the drain
