when booking we chose to pay a little extra because of proximity to the beach and the design the pools looked amazing much farther from the beach than we thought what was described as an minute walk was in actuality more like minutes through some winding parks and confusing cross roads no facilities in room and no shop no ice machine no vending machines at all when my partner needed ice for her ankle i had to go buy some from the gas station we had to steal coffee from a business convention as there were no coffee facilities in the room or in the lobby and staff were often absent it was hot but we had no fridge and no way to keep drinks cold the skyline pool looks fabulous but in actuality it only looks over a small portion of the skyline enclosed on three sides and the pool was only open to which was impractical the indoor pool cost extra euros per day
