first of all this is not a star hotel the furnishings in the room looked old and has poor facilities the air condition in our room didn t work and after complaining to the reception they didn t fix it we had to sleep in a sauna while we were resting suddenly housekeeping entered the room unannounced moreover there were hair all over the bed and the floor was dirty we had to keep the window open for some air because it was suffocating there was no kettle or coffee making facilties neither sleepers on the floor i have paid lesser and got much much better facilities in other hotels don t be tempted by the offer its a sham
