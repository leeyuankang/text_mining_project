the view from our room some ugly pavements was depressing the reception staff was bored and just could not try and look interested they did not even looked for a taxi when we had to go to the olimpic harbour we ended up walking and it was actually cool but they were not supposed to know that when we took our suitcases to eventually go to the airport they failed to deliver again the charming helpful and english speaking porter did that so all in all down with the reception staff they should go somewhere and learn to be professional the grounds around the hotel were pretty ugly
