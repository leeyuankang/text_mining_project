never go to this hotel the night shift staff were terrible especially one particular young man and one young lady who pretended to be a manager of that young man for the purpose of assisting that young man in forcing me to prepay all the costs for my intended whole stay i checked in and provided my credit card as guaranty as required by the check in staff on the first night but that young man then for two consecutive nights bugged me for full prepayment claiming that the check in staff had been wrong and he must have my prepayment i asked him to get his manager calling me or leaving me a note for confirmation of such rule but never was there such a confirmation the young man assisted by the young lady finally succeeded in getting my prepayment by withholding my doorkey threatening addtional charges for a ridiculous claim menacing calling in the police and defeating any good impression i could have with the hotel i then realized that it was the same young man who had been scolded by a tour guide for his bad services to his group at the night of my arrival
