the mini bar was in a cupboard and was burning the wood kept having to turn it off to get rid of the smell of burning wood views could have been better restaurant was awful i know me and my girlfriend turned up a bit later on in the day but they didn t bother with presentation the starter was enormous so we didn t finish it to leave room for the mains and the waiter was really quite nasty to my girlfriend about the left food the mains were really bad i had to wait minutes to be able to eat mine as it came out boiling hot and just plonked on a plate my girlfriends was just horrendous do not know what they were trying to do with that once we had finished we were rushed off the table and was going to mention the issues but the waiter was so cold thought what s the point he just wants to finish
