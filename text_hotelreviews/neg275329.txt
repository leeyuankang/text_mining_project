for someone looking for central location it is a bit far from downtown around minutes by cab but since that wasn t the purpose of my trip it didn t matter but if its the location you need for your work it is perfect the mattress might also seem hard for some people but it was good quality so i didn t mind only other tiny drawback tough to find with this hotel really it was really a beautiful hotel with an economy price is that the walls seemed a bit thin but nothing that a set of earplugs couldn t overcome street noise was minimal even from the third floor
