i specifically phoned in the day before to ensure i received a double bed rather than twins i arrived to two twin beds they then tried to convince me to pay extra to upgrade after refusing so they said due to their fault they would upgrade me free of charge all they did was move me to a different room and pushed twin beds together as a result my partner and i slept in the crack of the bed the entire night due to renovations neither the rooftop bar or the spa facilities were available both of which are big pulls for my reason for booking the fact that they were out of use was only brought to my attention after arrival
