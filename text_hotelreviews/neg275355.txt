i had to go to the airport early in the morning the previous night i asked the staff in the hotel to book a taxi but surprisingly they refused to do it instead they suggested me to try in a nearby taxi stand or to stop a taxi in the street eventually it turned out that there was a taxi when i needed it but i felt a bit uncomfortable about the whole thing
