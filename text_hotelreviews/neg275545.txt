we stayed nights at barcelona prince hotel we were first assigned to room the room was in the shadow side and had bad ventilation we found mold on the wall of the bath room we stayed one night in the room and requested to change room and been reassigned to the new room faces the morning sunlight and sea there is no more mold smell but when we enter the room we saw a bug on the bathroom floor which was really disgusting see picture after all the experience we had a bad memory in the hotel for nights the room cleaner has done their job with good efforts i think the problem lays with shower design it is a fault design as if you are not careful when shower the water splits everywhere in the bath room and makes the whole room damp and easy to get mold bugs
