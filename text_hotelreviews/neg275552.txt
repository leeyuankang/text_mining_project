it was a shame not to have a balcony to enjoy the views even more and the sheets in the room had dried blood on them even though changed twice despite this the room was lovely unfortunately the pool areas were always busy which was a shame the hotel is a little far from the airport in terms of public transport over an hour and changes on metro so do expect to use taxis
