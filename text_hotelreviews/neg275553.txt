the area is very touristy so don t expect amazing tapas around every corner rooms are pretty small plus the partion between the bedroom and bathroom is glass so you can see you partner showering or going to the bathroom the wifi is pretty crappy being on the floor meant waiting constantly for the lifts as one was out of order during our stay it meant we spent half our day waiting around in the lobby or our floor the sunbathing area of the top floor pool was big enough either to get hold of a lounger we had to get there at
