the pools although nice do not really accommodate the number of guests staying at the very large hotel we tried to go a couple of times however each time was too busy and we couldn t get a seat the room could do with more plug sockets although a hair drier is provided it was very heavy and required you to hold down the button at all times i decided to use my own instead but could not find a plug socket close enough to a mirror to do this again due to the sheer size of the hotel getting to the ground floor from the floor can take a long time because we had to stop at every other floor for more people to get in
