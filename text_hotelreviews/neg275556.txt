the breakfast looked somewhat ok but it could be better so i preferred not to have it as an option as it was quite expensive the night shift personnel were very rude and actually not any helpful at all i asked for help with luggage and they showed me the carriage so that i will do it myself i know some of the persons working at the front desk during the day were more than helpful and did their best to furnish all my requests while my stay there like my amigo miguel who was excellent but this guy on the night shift was terrible even threatened of cancelling my reservation there for an absurd reason that wanted everyone to give them their id before the room was offered to us so everybody should have their id s ready to get in the hotel even if it was a m and really wanted to go to sleep i believe that most hotels if not all just need the id of the person that reserved the room and a visa card at the most but just imagine someone travelling with children and to have to show everyone s id s before he gets the rooms good luck
