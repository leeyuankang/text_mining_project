the hotel security was sporadic and we had a handbag snatched in reception when no security on duty when alerted the reception staff fetched the security guard gave us info re the police but then never contacted us again during our stay the hotel bar closed early and only room service after for residents bit early when travelling with teenagers and out seeing the evening sights in the city would have liked a nightcap altogether as on holiday
