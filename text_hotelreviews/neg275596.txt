no in room coffee maker at the price we paid the facilities were not great towels were an issue as the hotel had shortage i had to ask for towels multiple times as they were not replaced the shower was poorly designed as the water was leaking onto the floor the hotel is very over priced there was no morning coffee or water available on the lobby for this price there should be more facilities the printers did not work properly either the breakfast was pricey especially since there were no make to order omelettes or pan cakes etc
