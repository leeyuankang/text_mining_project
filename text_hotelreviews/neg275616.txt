the light in the bathroom was bad for applying make up or shaving two cushions per person on the bed one was too small the other too big the hotel has floors but only elevators lots of waiting time and endless stops on all floors before you are up or down the business area is way too hot so we worked in the room instead the gym is very small and the only weight lifting machine was broken after a sweaty excercies we had to pass an outside passage it was very windy and cold before you could go back to your room not handy to avoid a cold
