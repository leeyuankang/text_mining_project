there was no king size bed but attached mattresses there was a huge crack in the glass wall between toilet and shower even after reporting this no action was taken except for some staff at the reception the staff was very cold and not service oriented there are only elevators and a broken service elevator which made waiting for the elevator an annoying daily event i do not know how star are assigned in spain but this is not a star hotel
