the first night that we came to the hotel the bed were uncomfortable and we became itchy due to the fact that we think there were either bugs or those sheets were not changed probably the second day we were moved to another room in which the heater was not working it took three hours for the staff members to let us know that they could not fix it it would need to be fixed the next day the point was that we had called around o clock and it was o clock at night when we got in formed we had called three times insistently and yet no one had told us anything by this time we were tired and we re not willing to wait any longer due to the discomfort of this hotel we had to check out the night before making our trip a very unpleasant one in barcelona
