the hotel is l shaped linked by a glass corridor from the lift being on the floor this was not ideal for my fear of heights so i was given another room nearer the lift so i didn t have to walk the glass corridor unfortunately the water seal at the bottom of the shower door was broken which resulted in a serious flood to my room on my first morning it took me about to mop it up i reported it to a housekeeper who said it would be attended to but after three nights it wasn t fixed i resorted to repairing the door myself by inverting the water seal and attaching the broken piece of it to the top of the shower door as an added precaution i placed a towel at the bottom i m sure the previous occupant of the room would have had the same problem i m not sure euros for breakfast is excellent value but to counteract this the mini bar was free and topped up daily
