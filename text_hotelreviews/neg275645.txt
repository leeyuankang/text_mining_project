rooms need soundproofing could even hear the shades being raised lowered from the room next door the outside noise seemed like the windows were open the street sounds were very clear even above the floor rooms are modern updated but seemed to be lacking in quality the location is close to the water a couple of blocks away but a large fence prevents one from actually going onto the shore the tour busses don t run past this hotel in the off season
