i did not find the crew friendly just acceptable however the prices are quite high one night we paid close to euros and they kept me ranging up in the room until i went down to the reception to pay not really acceptable on this level be prepared that you have to wait for the elevators minutes whenever you use them the walls are really thin you can hear everything what is at the neighbours and on the corridors big disappointment is the wifi so after you pay euros a night you have to register yourself or give your facebook account in order to use it no one wants to be spammed with their unwanted marketing offer after you pay this amount per night
