few small issues on the telephone the button is stuck making it difficult to call the long and complicated room service number small details matter and shoulnd t there be a single button to dial room service also it seems asking for a spare toothbrush does not constitute as room service in a star hotel which is odd they asked me to come downstairs to pick one up then when i got downstairs they couldn t find one and said they would send one up the staff that i spoke to were not extremely friendly and when you re on the phone to room service they are not extremely helpful either in fact it seems they re quite busy to the point where they re almost insisting you get off the phone that s how i felt one more thing when you re in bed you d like to turn off all the lights with the light switch but it seems most of the lights you have to manually turn them off at the power switches which is a bit annoying once you re cosy and in bed
