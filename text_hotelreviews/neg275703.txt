shower was poor soaked the floor room causing slip hazard i fell room cleaning was below par they even forgot on one day the hotel has floors and only lifts so always had to wait on one day mins not good if you are in a wheelchair as my wife the pool on the roof was not wheelchair accessible and the splash pool on the floor had no disability aids not a very wheelchair friendly hotel which is a shame as it could be great
