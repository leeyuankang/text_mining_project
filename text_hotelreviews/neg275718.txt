slow elevators during the peak time you can wait minutes for the lift some times they don t work at all hotel is fairly good located next to the shopping center but unfortunately far from all the attractions you need at least minutes to get to the city center by either tube changes tram or a bus because of that i think this hotel was slightly overpriced small and unequipped gym
