i booked a superior terrace room for me and my partner for a break away the staff were not very welcoming quite rude we were made to pay upfront for the room usually you pay when you check out then on the bottom of the receipt it said no refunds why didn t she make that clear and make sure we were happy with the room before payment nobody helped us with our bags they could see we were struggling the bed was a small double and so uncomfortable room service and laundry services were not answering the phone so i had to keep calling reception more of a corporate hotel
