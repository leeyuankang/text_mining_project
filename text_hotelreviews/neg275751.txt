they do not include irons in the room however they also do not allow guest to rent any irons guest have to use their expensive laundry service unless they bring their own travle iron it would have been nice to have read this in the description or on their website the room service food was horrible see photos below i had to speak to the manager of the kitchen to et it resolved but i never ordered room service food after that when a woman and her crying baby was place across the hall from me i had to request a room change but i also requested to speak to the hotel manager twice each time he was not available nor did he bother to contact me to make sure my matter was resolved i have never seen such an unprofessional lasy hotel manager in my life a guest shouldn t have to chase the manager to obtain satisfaction in a matter i don t recommend this hotel go to the hotels across the street you pay a little more money but the service and everything else is much better
