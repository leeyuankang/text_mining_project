the bathroom shower cubicle water leaked out and across the tiles everytime which was quite dangerous not to mention inconvenient when you have to clean it up the air con wasn t cold enough we would have liked to have changed the temperature ourselves the lifts were a nightmare in general and at months pregnant and staying on the floor sometimes the stairs were actually a better option
