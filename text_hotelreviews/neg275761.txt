this hotel definitely needs more elevators if i d been on a lower floor i wouldn t have even used them but i always waited several minutes once over for them one morning the housekeeper knocked before we left the room and i asked her to come back after her next room by early afternoon it wasn t clean and a male hotel worker told me it was too late to clean or get towels i ran into a lady next and she was happy to clean it for us odd breadfast was not cheap but very good
