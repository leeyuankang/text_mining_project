the rooms were nice but the shower was so frustrating the shower leaked through the door which made the whole bathroom floor look like a pool and it even went into the separate toilet that was annoying loved the free bar although instead of another soft drink it would have been nice to have an extra beer bit annoying when both myself and my husband wanted a beer and there was only one the lift was probably the most frustrating thing out of the whole holiday they just stopped working and when they did work we could wait minutes for one of the three lifts to arrive
