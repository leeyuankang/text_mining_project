room service was not a very pleasant experience the person who came was rude and he didnt like it when i sent an item back because it wasnt what i ordered the floor pool area i dont understand why there was only sunbeds there when there are floors filled with guests that wants to get the chance to sit there i know there is another pool on the third floor but it is also very tiny and felt weird swimming there if there was one other person swimming as well because you came so close to eachother in the pool princess barcelona sells this hotel with its sea views and pools but they were both a disappointment view of the ugly museum roof was not very nice i didnt think it would be so visible at the floor but it was and the rooms walls were very scrached made it not so fresh feeling
