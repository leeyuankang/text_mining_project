the hotel is falling apart when we came back to room the toilette door was out of place it was same with the bath the tap was stuck so we could not even use it the pool in rooftop the one in floor as well is incredibly small besides there are only beds to lie down where you can never find any available moreover people smoke and drink in the pool hence you can imagine how dirty it can get easily it is really far from center and the sea is not near as looks at the maps very sad to pay euros per person to breakfast
