after a trip to see the last showing of the fountains a tram and a metro ride away we came back feeling very hungry it was our last night before coming home and would have liked to have finished off with a final cocktail unfortunately the bar had closed and therefore our only alternative was to order room service due to the location of the hotel we had to make our way back earlier than we would have liked but we were worried about public transport times
