we had asked for a nice room as we were celebrating our month wedding anniversary but we were given a room down in basement level which obviously meant no view then the bed consisted of two single mattresses pushed together on a wooden base which was far too big for purpose the room was smaller than we expected to get for the we paid for the two nights also the shower tray is pretty much on the same level as the bathroom floor so if you re in the shower any longer than a couple of minutes the bathroom floor gets totally flooded all in all definitely not worth the money we paid
