not enough lifts for the hotel would often wait very long times for the lift especially in the mornings the pool is too small for the size of the hotel never any sunbeds available we paid for superior rooms which were vey small and dark and the breakfast was awful the food at the pool bar wasn t nice either for the cost of the food i expected a lot more the beach was further than advertised too i would stay at this hotel again
