had to ask for gluten free bread and pastries even though i d requested this with my booking the first day it didn t even arrive even though the staff confirmed it ll be with me in minutes i was pretty full by the end of the brekkie so didn t bother chasing all good the second day and they were very apologetic about the first morning
