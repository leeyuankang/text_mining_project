we checked in and they gave us a room in which you could not use the bathroom the door actually touched the toilet and you couldn t even squeeze in past the door crazy totally unusable why changed room and had better view and nice size bathroom we traveled all night therefore missing breakfast that was prepaid they would not give credit or refund they could have been a little more accommodating not pleasant either
