the reason i book this hotel was due to the nice pics they have on the web but unfortunately as i arrive i didn t like the reception area it make it look like a cheap hotel it looks very boring nothing fun to see even my friends hotel that they book was more impressive the hotel is huge only needs an elegant and more decoration at the reception area and the smell coming from the toilet was horrible swiming pools were ok because of the sea view i wouldn t be so sure to recommend the hotel to my friends
