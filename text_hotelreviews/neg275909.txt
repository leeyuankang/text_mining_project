sound isolation between rooms is totally forgotten you hear everything on the next room if your neighbors fight each other then you ll have huge problems whenever trying to sleep our neighbors firstly listened music very very loudly then we asked to the reception to warn them then they started to fight each other and the fight continues during all night we called reception again and they sent security but next day we learned that guest were still staying in the hotel and they still listening music very very loudly again so we asked to change our rooms finally they changed our room however if somebody makes you a problem their reservation should be canceled this is totally wrong management
