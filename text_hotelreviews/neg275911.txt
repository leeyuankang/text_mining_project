the window leaked like the window to the outside one of the days rained all night and we woke up and the ledge was soaked in water luckily we only had clothes near it so it wasn t a big deal also the glass in and around the faucet had mold in it it was obviously a poor design b c you cannot get in between the panes of glass to clean around the faucet last the pipe to our sink was fixed with duct tape granted it didn t leak but it looked tacky
