the hotel is located near the sea so it isn t ideal for the city centre bars and clubs that said the metro underground station is very is close by and travel is cheap unfortunately i had to amend my booking from nights to night the system would not let me do this without trying to charge me around for my existing room for night more than the cost for the nights so i had to cancel my room and re book on arrival the cancellation of the room for nights did not show on the system barcelona princess please note i do not want or expect to be charged for nights as one of the rooms i booked was definitely cancelled thank you
