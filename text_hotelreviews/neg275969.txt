we arrived early so we could check in but our room wasn t available so they told us to come back in a couple hours so we went to the beach came back hours later and were still waiting for our room mins later our room was ready but they needed to still send housekeeping up to make the bed a full bed instead of two seperate twin beds the design of the bathroom is just stupid the shower leaks into the toilet area which is divided by a glass wall so no privacy the toilet smelled of old sour mildew and had mold we left for the city one day and put the sign on for room service we were gone for about hours or so when we came back we saw they had taken the sign off but hadn t actually cleaned the room nor made the bed we called for room service waited about they still hadn t came to clean then we called the front desk and waited another mins before someone showed up needless to say this hotel needs a serious upgrade and better communication
