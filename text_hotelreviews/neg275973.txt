the pillows at the hotel were not great there was a huge cushion and a very slim thin pillow we asked for alternatives but it was just more of what was already available we had a double bed which was singles put together which meant there was a gap down the middle swimming pool was too small to service a hotel of floors and guests and was mainly used for smokers which isnt great if you dont smoke
