the room was poor we arrived to find old dirty socks in our room and overall the room was basic and the carpet looked like it needed a good steam clean the location of the hotel for a family isn t great either although there is a carrefour and shops nearby for essentials the beach is a good min walk and nothing like our previous stays in barcelona we wouldn t stay again due to the cleanliness of our room nor the location
