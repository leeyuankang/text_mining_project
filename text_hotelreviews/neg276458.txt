there were no cups in the room for tea and coffee only paper cups which is not good enough for a four star hotel environmentally unfriendly and burn your hands if you like hot tea only one small pillow each the choice of tv channels for the kids was poor only bbc news there was quite a bit of noise from the band upstairs although it ended fairly early the walls were thin and shook whenever a door slammed closed the cooked breakfast was cold and inedible making a cup of tea at the buffet was difficult as they only had coffee machines and hot water the cold milk wasn t near the tea and coffee had to hunt around for it novotel hotels are clearly not for me no feeling of value for money for the euro charge per night
