the staff and the organization of our rooms was disgusting the rooms were available hours after we tried to check in we wasted an hour trying to arrange the check in the receptionist who was dealing with check in was most unhelpful she told us to go grab a drink in the bar by the lobby to which all the staff ignored us and said we needed to go to the roof top bar for a drink we then went back to the reception only to find the previous staff member has disappeared we then had to sort our check in deposits all over again no one apologized about the delay no one was bothered in the slightest we nearly missed our dinner celebrations due to this luckily the restaurant pushed back our table they also tried to put our rooms on seperate floors when we had group booking
