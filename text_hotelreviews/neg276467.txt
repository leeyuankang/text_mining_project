complications on payments due to hotel taking a charge on my credit card due to arrival after and we wanted to pay cash for entire stay eventually resolved but only after involving a number of staff senior staff all friendly but one or two more junior staff on reception quite sullen left short of towels and toiletries on two occasions and would wonder as to extent of daily cleaning as a number of used items left behind after cleaning pool area on roof impressive but pools not heated and freezing note that given the number of people in the hotel the area is quite small and will get crowded easily also noted plastic bottles and debris floating in it but it was not being used at that time minibar prices very very expensive there are three lifts for the nineteen floor hotel so they quite quite busy at peak times i was left waiting for up to minutes a couple of times as people headed for breakfast or checkout
