breakfast selection is extensive but if you do not eat pork your choices are limited for hot breakfast only non pork options are spanish omelette tomatoes topped with breadcrumbs and fried eggs no meat free sausages no hash browns no mushrooms no beans there are however a selection of croissants breads etc staff were okay some more helpful than others but i guess that s life only ate at the restaurant once menu was a bit limited and when i ordered croquettes on the menu they came covered in pancetta i had to ask for the waitress to take them back explaining i do not eat pork my main was fish and that too came sandwiched with pancetta again i sent it back i checked the menu and it does not stipulate that both dishes come with pork and i raised that with the waitress my main was prepared again but the chef did not appear pleased which made me uncomfortable the waitress however was apologetic
