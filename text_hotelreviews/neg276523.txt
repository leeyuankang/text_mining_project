the hotel was fine overall but i did not appreciate that the price which i was quoted and which had been debited from my credit card upon booking the room on booking com was actually in the end higher than quoted so on departure i was charged an extra euros per night without any clear explanation despite querying it i don t think that it is good practice for hoteliers to charge more that what was initially quoted and debited for no real explanation i would not recommend or book this hotel again for that reason and i would like someone to explain to me why this happened on that occasion
