the temperature of the swimming pool was extremely cold like water out of a freezer i was worried the kids would catch a cold we had to ring room service three times for the iron which came the next day in the hotel room description it said for a family of four their would be a queen size bed and two single beds but there were just double beds with lumpy pillows which were quite uncomfortable also a really unpleasant stench like a sewer smell in the bathroom
