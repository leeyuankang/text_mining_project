i found a chewing gum in the window shades that is really disgusting and disappointing almost a night just to find an old chewing gum in the room i couldn t look at it anymore i could not believe that room service did not noticed it i have also noticed that the room lacks soom privacy it tall buildings next to it it is easy to see through the big windows unless you put the blackout all the way down also had to wait hour for room cleaning i have also found a roll of duct tape under the bed really this hotel has all it takes to be an amazing hotel but it fails in the smallest details
