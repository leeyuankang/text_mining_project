don t bother getting the breakfast if you re staying on the weekend we went at different times on both the saturday and sunday and both days juice glasses and food ran out without being refilled or checked they also ran out of tables at one point during the week breakfast was fine and kept on top of we were quoted a taxi price of euros to get from the hotel back to the airport by the staff member who booked our taxi when infact it was just for having three pieces of luggage there weren t as many sun loungers as we thought so we couldn t relax on the roof not very many traditional food places to eat nearby
