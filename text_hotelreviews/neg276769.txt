the personnel was so rude especially the guy who is called martin at reception was terrible the room was not clean the pool on the roof is like a joke the bed and the pillows were so bad that we couldnt even have a good night sleep even the wifi connection was not working properly trust me this hotel only counts on its location but nothing else you can find thousands different hotels in barcelona that are close to metro stations as this poor hotel
