the staff move very slow u ask for a drink and it takes about to make a simple drink not a complex cocktail a shot and mixer i found that shocking also they didn t provide us with the two beds we requested on our booking months before arriving we asked them to change but refused and became quite rude and advised its just a request not acceptable for grown to share beds at a hotel with this star rating breakfast was not included in the cost of this booking we paid for rooms
