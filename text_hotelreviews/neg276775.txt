the pool it is the size of a hot tub one of the main reasons we chose this hotel is the pool especially for the time of year we were there it was tiny tiny can only fit a few people standing up and it s strange because the roof top is big lots of wasted space soundproofing we could hear people next door when they went to pee and with electric curtains in front of windows that makes a lot of noise you could hear all the people living around you when they took them up and down no matter what time of day or night and drink people talking normal voice in hallway was also easy to hear bed i m but normally not a problem here i would sleep with part of legs outside since bed so short and it was very very hard for me that was ok but my wife hated it breakfast generally good but no vegetables only tomatoes it s so strange not to be able to eat vegetables for breakfast but pastry with sugar on they had lots of english other then the reception not many understood it tv shouldn t matter much on holiday i know but other then some spanish and german channels not much to watch was one english if but stopped working i mentioned it and got told they couldn t fix they got tv signals from outside company i could talk to them that just made med speechless wifi i have never had such bad wifi in my life it almost never worked especially in room and so slow like with the tv they told me i could call the internet company myself to fix i m a computer engineer with years dealing with networks i know when the problem is unit or infrastructure
