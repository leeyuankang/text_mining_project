the customer service was not to a star standard during our stay we had two leaks in the bathroom and this was dealt with poorly by staff at the hotel they attempted to brush it off on both occasions and didn t take my complaint seriously we also found someone s clothing in our room the restaurant is also over priced and the food is not especially good
