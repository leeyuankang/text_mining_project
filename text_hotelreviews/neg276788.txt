really uncomfortable bed seriously really really bad sleep the bathroom smelt awful and the water smelt of sewage the carpets and fittings were stained and shabby the staff were dismissive and unfriendly noisy corridors and you can hear the automated blinds in neighbouring rooms the terrace was over crowded the swimming pool is tiny and the bar tapas was not very good quality even the hairdryer was crap
