i would like to inform all the future guests whom will be staying in the same hotel that my mum s bag was stolen in the reception while she was doing the check out the bag was right next to her and the receptionist was trying to distrust her by telling her that she ordered coffee to the room logically the receptionist are right in front of her so if anyone passed by or took her bag they would have seen it or at least the security whom observing everyone who is entering and exiting the hotel main gate however the manager also was not very helpful and did not want to open the cameras and see if it was someone in the hotel or not he said he would have done it only with police report he didn t even try to call them for her as the case did not matter to him this much the bag was brand name of burberry with versace sunglasses and ferragamo wallet with good number of money with all the credit cards and ids i would like to understand if this is not the hotel responsibility then who does
