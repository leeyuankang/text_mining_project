there was no complimentary tea coffee kettle in the room which i thought would have been standard for any hotel the beds were very hard and were only provided with one pillow each the tv worked but was very grainy so ended up turning it off anyway the blinds are automatic and you can open and close them by a switch next to the bed but unfortunately the noise of other people s blinds opening and closing was very loud and woke us up every morning
