staff weren t interested we had booked a suite as a celebration for my husband s and i d asked if they could arrange something special in advance offering to pay of course but as a surprise nothing was done the rooftop terrace which was a major selling point in the hotel was closed this should have been made clear at the point of booking as we would have changed location instead there was a note stuck inside the lift very impersonal and not a four star experience
