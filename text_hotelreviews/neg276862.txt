i was very disappointed and regretted i did not booked for other hotel as my second choice were marriot hotel by the sea the actual hotel room was unfortunately far different from what were being shown in the picture in real in my personal opinion the room is a star hotel and the amenities were pouring and the cleanliness of the room was poor oily service dust in the corner everyday after having a shower the water came out and got wet everywhere please be noted i have already pay for a more premium room the space is bigger and have a sitting area i took my parents for holiday to spain as it was their years anniversary the quality of the hotel brings down the whole experience very disappointed will not recommended to anyone rather due to the central location i would have chosen novotel which is next door and in a much better condition
