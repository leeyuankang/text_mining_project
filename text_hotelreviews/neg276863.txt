the bed was too hard the pool area at the top was closed for days because of a party but we chose this hotel because it had a pool area and i wanted to enjoy the sun during the day so we were really unhappy with that and thought we deserved a discount since no one let us know the pool would be closed for days we found out when we got to the top the staff could have told us when we checked in also the meal replacement for the hot food was not good we sometimes had to wait when it was finished for them to cook more eggs
