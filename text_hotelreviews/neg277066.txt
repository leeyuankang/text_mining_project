minor issues the room we were in was a quite odd shape almost like a l bed was very large so where it was positioned it was very hard to get around the bathroom sink really needed a shelf above so as the shower we stayed nights and our pillowcases never got changed even the sheet was done once i am sure our room was not listed in those photos shown on booking com so bear in mind that might happy
