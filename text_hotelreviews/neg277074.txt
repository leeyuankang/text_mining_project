this hotel had the worst service on floors ever we went out around am leaving the card inviting the housekeepers to make up the room we came back hours later just to find it exactly as we left it we had to argue with the front desk manager who kept saying it could happen well it is not a hotel of rooms and the floor housekeeper had enough time to do it the housekeeper herself was beyond rude to us i suppose angry because she was about to leave and was forced to do her job and we had a walk of a half an hour despite being tired to allow her to do it surprise when we came back all she did was put the bed duvet back leaving dust and hair on it by the way she took away every single towel and did not put back clean ones which was something i realised just about i was to take a shower angry much that she had to work no sign of good will from the hotel whatsoever aside from generic sorry but it is not our fault i suppose it s the guest s fault then
