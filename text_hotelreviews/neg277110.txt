the water flow in the shower was not very stable the water was either hot or cold but not mixed together the distance from the metro station is a walking but not very short about meters which may be frustrating when all you want to do is get back to the hotel at night the bus services to the city center is very convenient during the week but not so much on weekends if you are a tourist and want to explore the city this is not the most convenient location
