didn t like bathroom open to bedroom difficult at night because switching light on woke up partner no bidet but unnecessary two washbasins instead no plugs for sinks but notice asking guests to save water etc safe on floor of wardrobe so not easy to access no kettle towel rack not easily accessible from shower
