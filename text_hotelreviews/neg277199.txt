when we were at the hotel for our first booking june the room was very strange with a wall in it behind which was the tv had to move it in order to see the whole screen very strange the hotel maybe more for business travellers and not tourists as nothing was available in the way of advice as to what to see and staff did not come across as very willing to assist staff however on our return from our cruise was more friendly and helpful and made us feel welcome
