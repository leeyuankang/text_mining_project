they don t have an electric kettle so you can t make coffee or tea during our stay it rained on and off so we asked for an umbrella from the hotel you have to leave a deposit of euros per umbrella they give it back and all but for a star hotel i find it kind of a cheap move i didn t like the fact that they don t have a free shuttle bus to and from the airport the hotel doesn t offer complimentary bathrobes and slippers
