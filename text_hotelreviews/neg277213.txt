this is just a minor quibble the nearest metro station diagonal is a minute walk from the hotel however many bus lines that go into the heart of tourist barcelona pass by the hotel i think it is excessive to charge euros for a breakfastt buffet no matter how good it may be the price discouraged my wife and me from taking the breakfast option cheaper and quite satisfactory breakfasts available in nearby cafes and restaurants
