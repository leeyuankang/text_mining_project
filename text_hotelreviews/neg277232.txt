its a star hotel at everything seems to be already out of date wall papers lifts linens windows like a hotel that must be renovated years ago old old old and the best part is bathrooms new trend to make them out of glass so when you are in the room you can clearly see and hear everything i mean everything so if you like to watch somebody taking a toilet our to be in shower and make sure another person sees you usually they make glass mate so you dont see details but here no they decided it would be cool to make it from clear glass in front of the beds so if you are that such a pervert welcome to the hotel
