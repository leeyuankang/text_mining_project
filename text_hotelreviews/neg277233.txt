i have no complaints about the hotel about the only thing i would suggest about this location is if you are a light sleeper and you plan to regularly sleep late at all do not get a room on the lower floors because of the road noise we were on the floor and it was acceptable but i think the lower floors would start to get loud avenue diagonal is a major thoroughfare and the road noise starts to pick up around am but that said avenue diagonal runs through the heart of the city and is very walkable lined with scenic palms and other trees with many excellent restaurants and caf s in the surrounding areas
