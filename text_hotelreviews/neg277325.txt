the staff was okay but lacked the kindness and warmth one gets at a smaller boutique hotel also we had rooms but we only received one small complimentary water bottle between both rooms and one of the rooms was short towels and amenities the front desk probably gave us a room that wasn t cleared by housekeeping normal things for a big hotel unfortunately we were spoiled by many other boutique businesses on our spain holiday so the hilton stood out as only okay also they refused to input my husband s hilton number into our reservation they said we should have booked through hilton i tried to book through hilton but they were sold out clean and okay hotel but there are better options in barcelona unless you re desperate to be near camp nou
