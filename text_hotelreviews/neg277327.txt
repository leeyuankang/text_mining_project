everything else not worthy per night wifi is very slow rooms are tiny and i have bruises from hitting furniture for days now the bathroom is very small and they gave me a shower despite my request for a bathtub beds are not comfortable staff are rude checking and out took very long breakfast is the worst very dull and tasteless staff in the resturant are not helpful as i asked once for a tea but the waitress just pointed to the coffee machine without bothering to show me how it works although i payed them the whole amount with deposit cash at check in they still charged my card after minutes for the stay which held my money and still not back to my card after days from the stay although i ordered earlier check in i reached the hotel after pm and my rooms were not ready and i had to wait hours for them also i make them empty the minibar in the rooms at check in but they still include everything in the bill at checkout which took long time to sort it out so in general worst stay ever no more hilton hotels for me in the future
