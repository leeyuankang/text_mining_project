the location suited me perfectly close to restaurants excellent shopping and a taxi stand however you do have to walk a few blocks down to get to a metro stop also my room was a little dark with not much sunlight making it in but that hardly mattered as i was out everyday i can t think of anything else and those things are so nit picky that they re funny it s a perfect hotel
