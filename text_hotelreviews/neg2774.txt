the size of the room is definitely smaller than the description befor arriving they informed us that the room we booked had something wrong so they will transfer us to their sister hotel which is two minutes walk we rejected and the first night they arranged us to a room at basement floor which was horriable i think it is because of overbook the hotel is not very clean and at the day the toilet flush button also didn t work well
