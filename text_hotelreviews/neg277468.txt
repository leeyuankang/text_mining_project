i booked this hotel because i wanted something special i dont mind paying more for a hotel if it comes with a good experience but this one was very underwhelming the room was generally ok but the bathroom was dated and dark the staff were very slow in both the bars and restaurants when your paying euros for a bottle of water you expect more
