room was very dated it feels like they ve spent all their money on the lobby and none on the rooms which is very disappointing after the wow of the lobby for example our carpet was threadbare power sockets were in awkward places none near the bed or near the mirrors drinks were very expensive euro for a small glass of coke and closest convenience store seemed to be about minute walk it s quite far out of town
