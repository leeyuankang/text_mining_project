the food on the bar menu was quite expensive according to the in room guide the terrace restaurant was open until pm but when we arrived at pm the host refused to seat us explaining that the restaurant had just closed he did not care what the in room guide stated the restaurant was still full of guests some of whom were only just receiving their first course the rest of the staff however were very friendly and helpful
