the first room we stayed in was on the sixth floor and hadn t been refurbished it was very dated the carpets were faded and the light fitting was hanging off the wall when we complained we were moved to the forth floor and the room was lovely the only down side was the wasn t a dressing table and it was awkward getting ready
