it is unacceptable for the hotel to limit the entry to the swimming pool and fitness area to adults only the hotel advertises its fitness and spa facilities as one of its kind allegedly the best in class it s partially true it is the only star hotel that i know which misleads its guests in relation to one of the most basic features i was advised by the reception assistant to go to one of several sport clubs in the vicinity of the hotel the lady at the fitness club entrance didn t even try to come up with any idea how helpful isn t it the worst was of course my son s dissapointment one can say that you can survive without a pool for a weekend of course you can but guests should be openly informed about such limitations in advance especially in a hotel
