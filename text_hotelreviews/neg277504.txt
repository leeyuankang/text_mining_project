the shower door leaked onto the bathroom floor badly the room lights were a bit awkward to figure out there are pre programmed settings with no on off for any one fixture the scrambled eggs for breakfast were terrible use real eggs instead of the powdered ones please there s no nice sit down restaurant at this hotel but there is a lobby area with tables and chairs where food can be purchased as you enjoy your beverages from the bar
