we were offered to use the executive lounge all day long for euros where there would always be something to eat from breakfast till night but we were advised the food on offer will be a few minor options and snacks we tried this one day but we re very unimpressed by what was on offer and not having a staff member there present to help the customers only made the experience worse the staff were very professional and apologetic when we gave them feedback about it and they even refunded us the money as they acknowledged that a staff member should have been there but they were short staffed that day so the lounge was uncovered at times also i would have liked a balcony on the room to allow smoking but none of the rooms seemed to have a balcony having said that having a cigarette downstairs while enjoying the amazing green view of the garden and trees in front of the hotel was great
