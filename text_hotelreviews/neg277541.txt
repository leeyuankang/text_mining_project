too busy not enough staff we waited minutes in a long queue to book in when we went to dinner we waited minutes and nobody approached us to give us a menu never mind a drink so we resorted to sandwiches in the buffet in the foyer all the items on the hot breakfast were cold the location was at least minutes from the centre of barcelona and was very isolated
