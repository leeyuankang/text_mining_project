the only thing that i d caution someone on is that the hotel is a bit far a minute metro ride from the city center and the prime tourist attractions the metro is close by and convenient so this wasn t an issue for me but if i was coming for tourism rather than business i would consider staying downtown one final note as with most business hotels the food on site is a bit pricey if you re willing to walk a bit there are a number of eateries that are not too far way to go to for lunch for dinner i would recommend taking the metro or a taxi to go somewhere in the city
