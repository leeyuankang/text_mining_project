room magnetic keycard this hotel has a serious problem with their magnetic strip room key cards my cards were never near a mobile phone or tv but they went off a few times in the night stay it was a nuisance and was more painful as these guys have really slow elevators slow elevators only levels but has public elevators but it takes forever to come why they are very slow and when you have issues with your magnetic key like we had a few times mins are gone going back down and back up again
