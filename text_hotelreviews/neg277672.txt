we booked the pullman skipper for our honeymoon stay in barcelona as it was advertised as a star hotel we wanted to pamper ourselves to summarize our opinion of the hotel following our stay it appears that the hotel caters almost exclusively to the business traveller and in doing so alienates the couples and or families that may be staying there the cons are noise we requested to have a sea view but this was a detriment to us the sliders for the balcony are paper thin and you can hear everything this includes club style music that they blast from both pools starting at and not ending until there is also a popular outdoor nightclub across the street where the noise is heard in all rooms until private functions as i mentioned before they focus on business groups primarily every night that we were there they closed off the pool areas by for private functions we were unable to access any of these areas and again the noise was unbearable when these events were going on lack of communication at times it was nice as they would provide a note on our beds as to what the weather would be the next day but one day we intended to go to la sagrada familia and walked for looking for a taxi but there were no taxis we had to take the metro we asked the front desk about this when we returned and it turns out there was a taxi strike that day the hotel knew about it but never informed the guests ahead of time we thought this was a major oversight
