worst hotel in the last years i m only star hotel traveller so it came to me as a shocking experience management in the accor group need to take immediate steps to solve this mess need to ask for everything almost waste of time and energy instead of being able to enjoy your holiday f e why no slippers in the room why i can t get into my room why wifi is not working can we have more shower gel and so on and on staff attitude is not acceptable lack of efficient english speaking staff constant wifi connection problems look photo constant electronic key door problems the bathtub and shower in our room seemed to be shredded by previous guests same goes for half cracked ceramic sink look photos cleanliness noise in the room misadvertised as soundproof disorganised chaotic service especially through breakfast you wait for a waiter to get coffee tea endlessly and than they take your plates when you are not finished it was more like circus than five star hotel
