i m afraid to say i was left extremely disappointed with my recent stay at pullman skipper i booked this hotel based on the location and great reviews i had read on trip adviser however the reality was some what different when we arrived to the hotel we was informed that we had been allocated the second best room in the hotel due to purchasing en executive suite for adults we was taken to a room on the first floor in the far corner and shown to shoddy dark looking room facing the main road i requested a room with a nice view as the trip was for a special occasion the room did not look anything like the pictures dark red d cor with brown carpets damp patch on the ceiling and plug socket hanging off the wall see attached pics i spoke with the manager and was advised the hotel was full so it wouldn t be possible to move today i called a second time later that evening and was then informed a room had become available and would i like to see it we was taken to a room on the floor which was completely different like the pictures much more spacious with light grey and white decor so we obviously agreed to move another issue we had was our cards stopped working on numerous occasions meaning one evening we couldn t get into our room this also happened on a second occasion meaning we couldn t access the rooftop pool most disappointing was the fact when we arrived we attempted to order some wine by the rooftop pool however was informed by staff that there was no menus due to only opening the day before if you are a star hotel and you know what day you are opening surely you would ensure that a menu could be printed ahead of time especially when your menu is only a laminated piece of paper the menu was very limited and food of poor standard we ordered a pizza and this consisted of measly slices
