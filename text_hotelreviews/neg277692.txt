the hotel is near a hospital so there were sirens in the morning and at night but it did not bother us too much the room service menu could do with some improvements on the food selection especially the night menu the pool on the ground floor looked uninviting and could use some deep clean as the floor looked stained and dirty the lobby looked a bit bland
