the wifi in the hotel was terrible i could not get it at the pool and could get it for a moment at a time in the room by lying down pointing the phone to the ceiling but only in a certain direction ridiculous also the hotel do not provide anywhere to shower later on in the day if you have a late flight the only place they have is the toilet area usually hotel would have a changing shower area in their gym spa but this was not the case albeit they have plenty of room to make somewhere
