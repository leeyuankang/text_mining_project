our check in was dreadful after emailing prior to arriving to ask if we could check in early we were told it would depend on availability which we understood but when arriving we were told which we also understood we came back to reception at and still no room we waited till before we got our room which was very frustrating when we could see other people checking in and able to get their room i notice on reviews that this has been a problem to other guests i think it s time to employ extra housekeeping staff when the hotel is busy we have also been charged on our credit card an extra amount we had checked out and finalized our account with cash this needs to still be resolved
