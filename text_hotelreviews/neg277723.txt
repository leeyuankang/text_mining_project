the check in was made by not well trained and competented srtaff as a result we were given keys of a room that was not ready and pre authorized the room charge and expenses twice the fact that a girl spoke our native language is definitely not enough to work with clients it is better to put more attention to the staff training in advance the water in the bathroom of our delux room either sticked or pored out i asked another trainer girl to send a staff to our room but nobody ever came it is a small thing of course but flowers in the vases in breakfast restaurant were in awful condition and were not pleasantly looking it is better to change the living flowers or to put the artificial ones the breakfast choice was good but did not give a feeling of first freshness unfortunately especially green leafs and vegetables because there are no elevators for staff use thouse we shared together were pretty crowded and slow to come
