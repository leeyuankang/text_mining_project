we were made to wait mins after the check in time we arrived at am paid for our weeks stay then left our luggage with reception until checkin at after visits to reception we were told we had already checked in and there were no rooms no one seemed to know where or when our room would be available it was a poor experience compared to the excellent service we received a year before there was an empty box of pringles in our mini bar on our arrival into the room which we could have been charged for had i not notified reception the shower heads were dirty on arrival there are not enough sun loungers at busy times and guest should not be allowed to leave towels on loungers for long periods of time during busy periods i know this is a common problem but it needs to be addressed by the hotel to prevent guests from fighting over loungers
