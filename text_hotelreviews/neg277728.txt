we arrived early after leaving a cruise whilst i didn t expect them to have a room ready in the morning it took till nearly in the afternoon before we could get our room they did give us a couple of free drinks though very close to nightclub area so in the morning there are lots of drunken revellers everywhere and lots of vomit on the streets having said that inside the hotel you can t hear anything
