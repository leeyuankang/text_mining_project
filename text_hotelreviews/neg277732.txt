this is not a star hotel it may have been when it first opened but those star details are definitely lacking now there were poorly fitted fittings in the bathroom the bath was cracked the bed was really lumpy they had a hugely thick duvet in the bed there were cables hanging from the tv the bar on the roof smelled of sick the toilets around the pools were not the cleanest the breakfast buffet though good again is not what you would expect from a star hotel having said that the things i have mentioned would not put me off staying here again but only if i got a good deal and lowered my expectations
