overall i was very disappointed with my stay at the pullman skipper barcelona i had high expectations considering the star rating and the fact it was so expensive but it certainly did not live up to that billing the staff provided inaccurate information on our first morning regarding a city tour which resulted in us wasting over an hour of our time waiting for buses we stayed nights and we never received fresh towels or had the room tended to in any way some of the staff were friendly and helpful others were not we also had to wait mins to check out while staff remained outside the check in desk not assisting anyone overall very disappointing stay considering the cost and not what one would expect from a star hotel
