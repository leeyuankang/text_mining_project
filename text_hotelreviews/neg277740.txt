the key didn t work and the staff tried to prove me it was my fault or rather that i didn t know how to use it or that i kept my mobile near the key etc with first room they have assigned us not even their master key worked so we changed rooms it didn t get any better considering we both had copies of keys it really was hard to accept all the excuses during our three day stay it hasn t changed reception promised to send a small gift to make up for all the troubles but it didn t happen not very cool to make empty promises they charge per pet per night which is the most we ever paid as not even charge that much but i guess spain s anti dog policy is to blame as very few hotels accept dogs will not be back to barcelona and to pullman any time soon
