room wasn t ready until and only offered a standard drink after a day of travelling i had to ask them to look after my bag the staff were very rude missed items on room service and in restaurant on meals and drinks access to rooftop pool didn t work via room card i had to call reception to come each time there were no clean towels provided on one day they provided no drink or meal service to the pool and they shut the rooftop pool for days of my stay we went for drinks at the w hotel and the attention to detail from staff was excellent and no comparison to the pullmans lack of service
