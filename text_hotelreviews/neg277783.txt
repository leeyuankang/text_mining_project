the staff at this hotel were appalling except one it is a very busy hotel and i assume because they have such high capacity they think they can get away with being rude and unhelpful everything we asked the reception staff was too hard every request impossible everything was our fault not the attitude you want to put up with when you are travelling with small children we stayed for nights over a weekend the hotel was full every night yet there was no general manager working thank god for ben on reception or i would probably still be waiting for someone to fix my door that wouldn t lock because i supposedly wasn t doing it right it was actually a flat battery in the swiper when someone finally came to look at it just one problem in the list of many that i could recite from our stay here we were disappointed with our stay here to say the least and it spoilt our time in barcelona
