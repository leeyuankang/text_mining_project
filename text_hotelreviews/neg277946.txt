booked a three bed room which wasnt available when we arrived fortunately a co worker had a twin room and was able to accommodate the third person we accepted this for the first night of eight nights and checked on two more occasions whether we needed to change to our triple room we were told we could stay put if we liked and they would leave us in those rooms despite the fact the accommodating co worker was checking out one night before us we were happy with that as the rooms were well positioned then on the last night no one seemed to be aware of this agreement due to lack of communication between their staff we were told one of the rooms had to be vacated because they were fully booked and they also had no triple rooms available despite out booking we had to pack our co workers belongings out and after we some discussion they placed us in a disabled room that could accommodate a third bed they also refunded the difference between a double and a triple room for the duration of our stay and threw in the safe key charge for free after we demanded they discuss that with the manager
