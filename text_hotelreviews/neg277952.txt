it was a soul less box when i arrived i thought i had walked into the reception of an office building this hotel has no atmosphere luckily you are so close to the gothic quarter that you can walk a couple of minutes to get atmosphere in the bars and restaurants simple things like shower gel would be appreciated and are expected at this price
