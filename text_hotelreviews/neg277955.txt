the hotel is using some air freshener spray in the rooms and we could not breath and we had to switch the room there is no carpet on the floor at all the breakfast offer is good just we couldnt eat in peace because the tables had been cleaned every time we are there and the rubbish bag was in front of us or close to us during we had a breakfast also it was very noisy because the kitchen door have been opened all the time the breakfast is served in the basement without windows although the hotel has nice lounge behind the reception with street view which is always empty a room isolation could be better
