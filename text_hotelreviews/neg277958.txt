if you have a car to park this hotel isnt the ideal because they have a parking space however isnt in the hotel is like or blocks away and you need to be catching the keys of the parking and delivering the keys leaving the car badly parking even for a short moment just to deliver the keys isnt very comfortable the breakfast is nothing special and very expensive like the parking
