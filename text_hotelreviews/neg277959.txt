the shower had leaking taps water pressure barley more than rinsed the shampoo out of my hair another thing that really annoyed me was hat the day before i was due to stay in this hotel they took the first nights fee out of my bank account which was never ever allowed to happen they said this was standard procedure but it is not stated anywhere on the booking com site or the hotels site so i wasn t impressed when i questioned the desk staff they just said we can do that if we want wasn t impressed with this at all also a lot of them didn t speak very good english but were all pleasant also for a star hotel they should have free shampoo and conditioner and other toiletries a very small slim little bar of soap does not cut star standards
