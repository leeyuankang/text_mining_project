the morning receptionist was awful when i needed to get my car out of the garage in the morning my son and i were in a rush to catch our flight the receptionist wanted me to fetch my car and then find my way back past road works and one way streets leave luggage child etc in the car on a double yellow line on a busy road and run into the hotel to return the garage entrance zapper eventually after much stressful complaining he reluctantly sent someone to come with me to open up the garage i had a child and luggage with me however the housekeeper that was eventually allowed to accompany me was wonderful kind and understanding thank goodness for her ps it must be noted that the night porter the previous evening when we checked in was much better than the morning receptionist the night porter acknowledged that the garage was very hard to reach with the road works so he let a member of staff guide us to the garage on arrival a big thank you to him
