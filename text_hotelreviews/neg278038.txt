bar food was very good but very expensive breakfast ludicrous price two bakeries cafes within walking distance serve excellent patisserie coffee sandwiches etc for quarter of the price and you can sit outside would have liked a couple of extras like a pool table or table tennis table to make it a little more family friendly some of the hostels at similar prices with those were full at the time we booked similarly lounge bar area a bit impersonal so we didn t tend to use it or be tempted to dine in apart from expense but then there is so much to see we were out for hours of the day pool in stunning spot but so very small it s really a plunge pool and too busy to use in high summer unless you wait for a long time for a turn best to go out of town to the sea
