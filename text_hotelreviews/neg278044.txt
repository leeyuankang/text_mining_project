only two slight complaints we had in our stay was the air conditioning wasn t working properly for the first couple days but the hotel staff were very helpful in trying to sort this for us it was made better but still not working properly and the other was the tv had very few channels with english and even fewer that worked in english trivial i know but it s nice to be able to relax in the room for a couple hours after a long day of sight seeing and understanding what s being said
