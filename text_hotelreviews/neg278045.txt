the website did not state how small the size of the rooms were and the first room i checked in the ceiling was leaking and had to wait hours before they gave me another room also the snack bar which offered finger food did not deliver what they offered on the menu didn t look anything like the picture i am aware that it s not always what you see as the picture is what you get but honestly i ordered fish and chips and it should have been called fish and chip literally chips in the basket
