the was no tea coffee facilities in the room there was a fridge which contained bottles of water when we arrived and was not refilled be warned if you want a holiday relaxing by the pool this hotel is not for you the pool area was a roof top pool max capacity to be comfortable about people but don t expect to swim its more hot tub size there was no waiter service at the pool side so had to go down floors for a decent drink or food there was a maximum of chairs on the pool area with only a foot to walk past and no room for children to play there were no parasols decking was shabby and the chairs were deck chairs not sun loungers so not really a relaxing time the ladies toilet door did not close properly
