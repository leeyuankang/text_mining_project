room service should be changed to serve yourself we needed a bottle opener so we called room service who brought a broken bottle opener and then asked us to go to the nearby store and open our bottle there at am we asked for towels and blankets and the room service guy chose to kick the door with his legs like police breaking into a home shocking and totally unacceptable real rooms are nothing like the room pics you see in the website stars is too much for this hotel or would be more appropriate pay a euros more for real value trust me total waste of money
