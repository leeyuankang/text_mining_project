overall we were delighted with the hotel and don t have any negative comments only thing i would point out is that the pool is small just in case you have aspirations of swimming lengths every day didn t bother me at all as what do you expect for a rooftop pool but i d guesstimate that it s maybe only didn t eat in the hotel at all so cannot comment on quality of catering nor did we have time for the spa
