the hotel is located a bit off city centre it claims to be a star hotel and maybe it once was but it definitely needs a makeover especially the rooms and the corridors service was good but housekeeping was poor the room we got wasn t clean when we arrived and wasn n properly cleaned during our stay either smoking is probably allowed in some rooms because the corridors reeks with stale tobacco
