reception staff should not work in this area with all the irregularities invoking the politics of the hotel which you do not know there is something dubious here because even though the payment was made as early as april you are also required the card and you are copied after this card such requests have not met anywhere in this world at any reasonable hotel otherwise the hotel is great fantastic breakfast good restaurant and rooms are very comfortable
