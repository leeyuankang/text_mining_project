the reception staff were reasonably friendly but unreliable upon booking the hotel we paid for breakfast for every morning however our flight was rescheduled for a morning departure and thus we would have missed the final breakfast we informed reception who unequivocally stated that no refund was possible but they would provide a substantial picnic to take with us the receptionist gave every assurance that this would be provided however upon leaving reception at we were extremely disappointed to find out that no picnic had been prepared for us and no refund was possible we left the hotel hungry and angry
