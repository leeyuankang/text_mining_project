in a local area out of the way which is good for a quiet stay the rooftop pool is very small and not much lounging space on the terrace the aircon was really not great never got my room below even at night or day the rooms are not soundproof so noisy neighbours coming home at midnight were a problem for sleep no main restaurant for hotel for evening meals instead snack menu which is limited not many places to eat near so is best to eat before coming back to the hotel
