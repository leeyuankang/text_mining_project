we were booking hotel with breakfast and in hotel they told us breakfast is not included we rented the car and hotel parking cost per night spa sauna jacuzzi is on extra charge too you only can use swimming pool when it s on opening hours and there is enough people to disturb you if you want to spend time relaxing too many drunk people shouting around and room service is knocking one time while already coming inside room
