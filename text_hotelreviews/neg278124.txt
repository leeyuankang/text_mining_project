the property was in a great location there is a bakery next door with cheap breakfast i would go there before i paid for breakfast at the hotel though the hotel was clean looked very classy and the rooms were super spacious for being in europe i was impressed when we walked in the room they also had larger tubs which was nice for a bubble bath after a long day they also gave us free drinks at the bar upon check in the safe in my room didn t work i called to have it fixed no one came to fix it the walls were kind of thin finally the water temperature was either super hot or super cold kind of uncomfortable but i appreciated it to soak my feet after a long walking day the wifi wasn t to great in my room we did stay in the top level so i just chalked it up to distance as i was connected to the same network in the lobby and it worked great and fast i would recommend staying on one of the lower levels there wasn t much of a view anyway all in all i would definitely stay here again when visiting barcelona
