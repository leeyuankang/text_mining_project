i was waiting to get checked in for minutes because there was only one guy at the counter so people were lining up the bed didn t sleep well and i ordered a double bed but got twin beds the chicken wings in the restaurant were dry the street is very noisy and keeps you awake and wakes you up again the fridge in the room only has bottles of water the elevator takes ages when you call it the lobby is always boiling even when outside is cooler
