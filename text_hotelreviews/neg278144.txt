room was small and narrow so the bed was taking all the space between one wall to the other making it difficult to pass floor and wall was a bit damaged maybe we were unlucky with this room because based on the booking pics the hotel was looking much better the bathroom door was not a real door my room was towards the main street ask if possible to get a quiet room to avoid the traffic noise
