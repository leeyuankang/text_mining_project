sat waiting for breakfast service for so long ended up getting a coffee in the main bar and breakfast outside of the hotel unfortunately although the spa is pictured and for the money you would expect it as part of the package we needed to pay to use it each day so a five day stay would have incurred extra the room was small but had a comfortable bed but lots of bits left on the floor and hairs in the bathroom and one dirty towel no tea coffee making facilities in the room which was disappointing whilst the hotel can t be responsible for their guests behaviour a lot of noise heard late at night and banging and glasses and crockery etc early in the morning
