the overall state of the hotel was a big disappointment not what i would rate with four stars the hotel rooms were really wore down and in need of refurbishment the air quality poor probably as a result of some water damage to the ceiling grey dots in the ceiling also when entering the reception area there was a very strong stench of chlorine rooftop pool area not very inviting and very small very low budget feel to it
