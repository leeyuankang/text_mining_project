booked premium room which was on the ground floor slightly strange i thought when entered the room literally the edge of building so was on a diagonal and felt cramped considering premium room also a bit bizarre as not much natural light due to small window which looked out at street level so people passing by and main road traffic windows are tinted on the positive being on the ground floor also felt the vibrations noise of passing trains underneath from local station room had some minor water damage on the walls which should of been dealt with prior to letting people stay in the room as did not give a good impression of the hotel and also the room was pretty cold and had no option for heating to be honest to call the room premium is a bit of a joke as if i had known this is what i would have got probably would have gone for the standard rooms which were above the first floor
