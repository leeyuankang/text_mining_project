we were robbed someone walked into our room and stole mobile phones and the hotel was rather non plussed about it in fact it seemed like they were not surprised but were trying to act as if they were they were not terribly helpful after the robbery aside from informing us where the nearest police station is and that there is nothing they can do they also insisted that it could not be an inside job and that many people had good equipment to break in
