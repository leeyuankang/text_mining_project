the room is soulless with no pictures or seating area no coffee or tea facilities in the room the location of the hotel isn t great for bars restaurants so at night you are a bit stuck toiletries are very basic one bottle does all bath gell body wash and hair the roof pool is more for a dip rather then a swim because of it s size our room wasn t serviced one day and reception did not seemed that bothered the hotel is currently receiving a much needed makeover and you can hear the work taken place also major metro and train station is beneath the hotel and you will hear and feel the trains from early till late
