we booked rooms for a family of persons rooms were good average but the aircon in one room didnt work and was too loud we were offered a gas heating unit to be put in our room which we declined we asked for a new room unfortunately the aircon in the next room was too loud as well the next room stank of tabacco and was very small finally they found a room where the aircon was still loud but nut unbearable unfortunately that room was in a different w ing to the rooms of the rest of the family and in a different floor very disappointing
