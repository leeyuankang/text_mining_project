i don t know how this hotel got such a big score we were expecting more for the price really a not a hotel as you enter the odd smelling room you notice that although it s not very small the lack of ergonomics given by the old furniture quickly transforms the slightest movement through the room into a nightmare the interior is dominated by white brownish marble that stretches from the bathroom throughout the room the result is really old looking and the bathtub with rust stains and the complete absence of ventilation in the bathroom confirms your bad choice impression going to bed you start feeling the cheap overused mattress and try to work with enormous pillows just praying that you don t get back pains you will and if you manage to go to sleep you have a wide array of noises that will most certainly wake you up at some point traffic just by a big blvd and the old windows that augment sound more that block it the room ventilation system if you dare turn it on the room maids or people in other rooms of course the walls are pretty much transparent to noise etc breakfast costs euros pp which is just obscene as you can eat a full gourmet breakfast at the nearby diego s restaurant for euros i highly recommend it
