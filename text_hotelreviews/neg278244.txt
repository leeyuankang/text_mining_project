maybe i can complain about things that i didn t like first of all about the wall sockets not many there were just on the desk and none free near the bed the second one concern the breakfast for very early check out i made i worked in a stars hotel and when our guests made check out before the breakfast service begun we prepared a bag with something to eat and drink i know that in the hotel there are vending machines but i paid for breakfast included but these are just two complains that didn t influence in my positive stay in this hotel and also i sure choose this hotel for my next stay in barcelona maybe there will be just some suggestions to feel better at home away from home
