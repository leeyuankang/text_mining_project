no english channels on the tv which is annoying because most of barcelona restaurants don t open until and then they close at and don t re open until so you have no choice but to be in the room for long periods of times about an hr walk from centre city so not in the best location pillows were very uncomfortable bath showers really dislike them and the shower curtain made the floor get drenched ordered room service and food was cold as they wouldn t deliver until the rain stopped but seems like the pizza was cooked and left for a while
