the location wasn t fantastic and the hotel is a little further out than stated in the advertisement it took us about to get to la ramblas however we knew it was further away than we would have liked having originally booked our holiday with low cost holidays and a hotel that was right next to the beach they went bust then of course so in fairness we were lucky to get something for the same price even if it was a little way out my advice would be to figure out the metro we did this and by the end of day we had it sussed and this made our journey to and from the hotel so much easier forget taxis there are so many traffic lights in barcelona that it takes ages a ten trip ticket for the metro is only and worth every penny also figuring out the metro makes it easier when visiting some sites that are a little further out like nou camp and sagrada familia
