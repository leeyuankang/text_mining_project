one of the reception staff a male was always very short and impatient i called reception and he put the phone down on me when i had not finished my conversation and it was about the blocked toilet the bell boy who came up to look was very helpful and friendly even though nothing was sorted as all that was needed was a plunger and cant believe the whole hotel did not have one in the end i used a coat hanger to plunged it and it was done the pool was a joke so small and over crowded the pictures was deceiving very intimidating especially when you bring young children to swim and it is full of adults checking out was unfriendly too
