up until the last night we had a really pleasant stay however upon returning to the hotel from a night out neither of our room keys worked went we went to get this sorted at reception the night receptionist was rude and extremely unhelpful after several attempts to reset the key it became clear that the electronic lock was broken the receptionist said that there was nothing he could do for us and couldn t leave the desk unattended after asking where we were supposed to sleep we were told that there were no spare rooms available and he didn t know after an hour and a half and several phone calls plus by friend manning the reception desk the receptionist managed to get us in to the room we couldn t risk the lock breaking again so had to sleep with the door propped open while i understand and appreciate that things like this happen i was not impressed with how this was dealt with the receptionist huffed and puffed and cursed us under his breath before hitting a wall when one of his attempts failed when we checked out the next morning we told the morning shift what had happened one lady laughed and a gentleman just shrugged not once did someone apologise to us
