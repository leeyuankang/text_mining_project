we tried the room service and it did not work at all we waited for one hour until we called and asked where our burgers are they blamed on the place delivering the burgers that they didn t respond it would be nice by the hotel reception telling the status while you re waiting also the opening hours would be nice to have all this started off by us wanting to have a sushi menu but that wasn t available it turned out after we ve been waiting for minutes also the first impression when we checked in wasn t very good when we were asked to give a copy of our credit card it also turned out that the credit card number was showed in clear text on the receipt this is information that should be protected by having your credit card number not readable for example xxxx xxxx as an additonal smaller thing a glass was missing after we arrived in the evening when we called reception we got the glass in minutes so that was quick delivery
