i asked for a double bed as i was on my own i booked the hotel in february when i arrived they had given me a twin bedded room opposite the lift i asked to move rooms but they said they were fully booked i got very little sleep the walls aren t sound proof and by the lift i could all the comings and goings plus the pillows were long and thin so not easy to sleep the bathroom was modern but the room could do with a touch up
