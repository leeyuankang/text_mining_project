we were given a tiny room with two single beds pushed together with each bed made individually when we had booked a double when we arrived at there was a queue at the reception desk with six individuals or couples waiting to be checked in and only one receptionist after waiting half an hour it was disappointing to be given a lousy room when my husband went to complain the receptionist said sorry sir but we can t move you we are full and my husband said but you weren t full when we booked and paid a month ago basically we were bumped off because we had prepaid to give them their due the hotel did move us to a much better room the following day but only because my husband was very angry the snack bar was also understaffed
