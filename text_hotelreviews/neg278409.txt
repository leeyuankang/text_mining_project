we were very disappointed with the room true we booked a double bed but this was the smallest room on the floor plan with very poor ventilation and no ventilation whatsoever in the bathroom to sit at my laptop on the desk one would have to keep the window closed since if opened it obstructed the desk when we complained about the room the receptionist said that if we had booked singlr beds the room would have been larger we asked to change rooms but were told by the receptionist that none were available and that we were only staying for nights otherwise we couldn t complain about anything else
