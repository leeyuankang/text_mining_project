as stated above we chose a premium room but were initially given a tiny room you could barely walk around the bed we complained immediately and were told that there were no significantly bigger rooms available however they did provide us with a much larger room the next day which was good other than the sound of rushing water mentioned above the lady on reception was not very helpful and ignored us when we were talking to her about it
