the room given to me was not the correct one booked on booking com the staff manager said the pics are not uploaded correctly and it s misleading after insisting and advising them that my colleague booked the same room and he received a room more than double the size of mine they offered to refund me which was ridiculous since i needed to be there for work eventually i was given something that was a bit bigger housekeeping does not refill toiletries and when i asked reception they said that they do not have extra you have to pay to use a scale to weight your luggage and reception does not give you change nor can they add it to your room
