staff is not that helpful we wanted change of some euro they refuse and gave excuse that they don t have change of also so poor hotel doesn t have sad hotel is ok inside safe area seems just ok but too many drama people around as one lady was cycling and fall down dramatically on street and looking at me and my husband that either are we looking at her or not next morning same front area of the hotel there is internet caf we faced two ladies with one kid tried to say something in her own language which i told her i don t understand sorry english she tried to push and snatch my bag i ran and went in caf so the caf owner said these ladies with kid they are baggers and thief so plz stay here for while let them go i think hotel should work on the surrounding security which effect their guest so in night we stayed in hotel and even in day time we were careful so be careful i guess in barcelona you have to be careful extra
