the swimming pool on the top of the roof is very small in high season there is little possibility that you will be able to use it the worst thing was that during my stay the crew started to paint all the walls on my floor s corridor the paint smell really awful although the stuff from the reception desk was ok the women bartender who worked on morning shift wasn t very nice maybe she felt a little bit sleepy in my opinion the cost was too high compared to the offer
