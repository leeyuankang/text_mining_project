the room was really small considering what we had paid and there was a corner that still had bare concrete it hadn t actually been decorated the worst thing about the room was the water pipe running past it it was ridiculously loud to the point where we thought the bathroom was flooding it banged loudly on a regular basis and woke us up a couple of times a night there was one lady who worked in the restaurant bar who seemed rude she did not smile once and gave one word answers she didn t say a word when she brought our food and just slammed it onto the table this member of staff was definitely the exception though the area the hotel isn t the best and not very pleasant to walk through alone at night if you re female the swimming pool was absolutely tiny and there wasn t enough room for everyone who wanted to use it
