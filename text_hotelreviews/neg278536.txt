we had a very bad fishy smell in the room we complaint about this and the only solution they had to offer was a spray of deodorant which made us cough also the beds at the pool did not match with the pictures there were some relax chairs but it was not possible to lay on your belly also no parasols next to this the food in the snackbar of the hotel was awful dont take the pasta bolognese is my advise
