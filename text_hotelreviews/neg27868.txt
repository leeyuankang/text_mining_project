the staff very rude upon checking in unpleasant greeting was not escorted to my room came back to the hotel after a night out staff engaged me and others into a rude line of questioning had to look for my key to get into the hotel as doors were locked i would expect the door man of a five star hotel to recognise guests staying in the hotel as i was walking into the hotel on this night the door guy let the door hit me on my way in as he didn t hold the door open it seemed a bit racist to be honest i paid almost a thousand for two nights for such ill treatment was not impressed by the room dinning food was plain worse food i ve eaten in a five star hotel one more thing upon checking in staff rudely asked for my passport whilst i m actually a resident here i gave him a debit card to process the payment for the room and after he rudely asked if i could use a credit card instead and then he seemed disappointed when i said i only have debit cards i don t see the difference between a debit and credit card i think it s a racist hotel i m staying in jumeirah carlton next time and i do come to london a lot your loss losers
