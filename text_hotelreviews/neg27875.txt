i did not have evening cleaning service called the manager on duty at night when i came back from dinner and she told me that housekeeping was closed how can it be closed in a hotel i was told that they will investigate i received no feedback and anyway this was not adequate when you pay so much money you expect service also about the cleanness the room had lots of dust you could see on the furniture however i have to mention that the room was otherwise clean and housekeeping when working was very friendly to end there was not a no disrurb sign in the room
