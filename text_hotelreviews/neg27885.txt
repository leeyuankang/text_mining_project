the parking area in the basement is very expansive for or hours however they said it s not owned by the hotel but even still paying guarantee for each night i stayed for night and they wanted me to pay x not reasonable but after talking to them and negotiate it they let me pay only hotel like this you should not put a trainee on the reception during busy times when checking in or out they just makes life harder for the guests
