they lost our booking through you i had e mailed them that our trip had changed and we would only be there night instead of two pre paid for two of course i understood no refund but asked for maybe an upgrade to our room they found the reservation and agreed we would have a nice room it was no better that our two other visits in fact was smaller construction going on for a remodel project like the location and service but this time it was not good and would make me not go next trip to barcelona
