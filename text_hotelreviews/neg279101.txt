there is a lot of graffiti and undesirable characters near the hotel and the casino on the same block parts of the hotel are very tired and need an upgrade we specifically asked for non smoking room yet we could smell the cigarette smoke from the smoking floor coming through the air conditioning very unpleasant and i would not recommend this hotel to others plus the noise from the street was continuous especially around when the local night club closed
