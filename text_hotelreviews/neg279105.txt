the smell of old smoke is everywhere i was first given a non smoking room but the stench in the hall was so bad that i was choking before i reached my room i then asked for a room on a non smoking floor while that hallway smelled better the room clearly has had smokers in it i decided they don t really have such a thing as non smoking rooms so stayed but wouldn t go back again for this reason alone d cor in halls and rooms is tired price was high considering standard of rooms
