expensive they charge a lot on the wifi though it was bad and slow they charge a lot on kids movies almost pounds each movie no variety in breakfast take in consideration if you request something from the concierge he doesn t fulfill your needs like booking having taxi ready in a certain time i had to wait for taxi to give me a ride to the airport although i requested that a night before i requested reservation for attractions the concierge promised to call me to confirm but he didn t so i had to start over again and wasted my time though robert alfonso from the concierge were nice and helpful
