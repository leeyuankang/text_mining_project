absolutely it is not a star hotel hotel was so noisy because the building is so old and the equipments in the room was not like a hotel since it is very common in barcelona to charge much more than expectation as a hotel they did not put boiler either tee or coffee in the room and asked us to go to the apolo cafe and buy if we want after asking for kettle for at the last night they put kettle in the room and wanted to charge us for nights euros just for kettle which we did not have time to use it for sure i did not pay for the unused kettle but i am so unhappy for hidden costs in spain every where
