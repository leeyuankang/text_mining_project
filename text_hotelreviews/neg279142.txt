i am not sure how this hotel has received a star rating the hotel is run down and needs a major renovation when you check in you have to pay at time of check in the front desk is very casual and not at all like a hotel the rooms on the street side are very noisy the bathrooms are old and need major renovation and rooms are old an tattered the carpet in hallways needs to be replaced you can stay at a much nicer hotel in a better location in barcelona
