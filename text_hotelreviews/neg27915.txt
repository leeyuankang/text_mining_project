even though i put a notice that i need an early check in i reached at am to check in and the room was not avalible yet which fine since they told me that during my booking the staff promised me to get the room by so i kept my bags with them and went to harriods to spend time till the room gets ready i came back at pm and still it was not ready and they told me they are cleaning the room this experience was a let down to me and they charge for in room wifi i used to get high speed internet while staying in a start hotel in hongkong so i expect a high standard from a start hotel in the middle of london
