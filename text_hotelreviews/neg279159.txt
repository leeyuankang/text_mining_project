the website reservation i thought i had made was for a per night room that had been discounted by to per night the room we received was what one could describe as an average hotel room with old fittings in the bathroom and worn carpet in the hallways as a wyndham privileges owner i would expect a much higher standard than was in evidence i feel i have been duped by false advertising and will be very wary of booking com in future
