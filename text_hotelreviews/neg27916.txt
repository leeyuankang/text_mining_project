instead of a room with park view at a higher floor i was given a room on the floor which was not a relaxing one as you can hear the road and building jobs next door hotel was so nice before and now it definitely needs refurbishment not a standard anymore if the owners and management think that russian and arab guests have to pay for location and there is no need to keep the place to a certain level they are mistaken not luxury anymore
