my wife and i were put in a room with two single beds no kettle for hot water no facilities for ironing no body cream they should know that guesses may arrive late at night travelling from abroad when i requested for a king bed the staff at the reception were not polite at all and told me it is first com first served as if guess has to fight go get what they have paid for or they should be penalised for booking a late flight however i was promised a king bed in the morning for which i had to argue agin as apparently there was no communication between the of the and the previous ones i felt ridiculous in front of my wife finally my room was changed with one with ironing facilities and a kettle however it was impossible for us to make any movements at night as the bed was the noisiest bed i have ever slept on for the money i paid i expected better facilities including the toilet sit i still need enquiry with booking com or the hotel to get money paid back to me i paid the tourist tax at the hotel reception with cash against no receipt once back in london i noticed that the hotel took an extra from my credit card i don t think i will ever use this hotel anymore
