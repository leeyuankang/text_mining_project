hotel stuff not being good to a frequent guest as well as a regular guest i guess they lack a proper hospitality as the hotel always run full occupancy even as an spg member i was treated like a normal guest i ve discussed this with them they answered me coz i booked through booking such an attitude yet this attitude is repeated again and again with every visit i make so this time i decided to leave a comment and i m going to send an email to spg loyalty program about my history with this hotel i visit other spg hotels i really was treated differently than normal guest enough is enough the hotel should do more than what it s doing
