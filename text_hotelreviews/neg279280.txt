location is really bad while parking around was possible eur per night of parking feels excessive for a hotel that almost requires to have a car room was quite unpleasant as it was facing right in front of a catwalk for eur a night i would expect a little privacy without having to pull the blinds there is absolutely nothing around the hotel no shops bars or restaurants be ready to walk minutes to find some commerce shops or supermarket
