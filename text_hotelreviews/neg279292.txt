room was not ready at check in time and staff asked me to wait to after refusing they changed me double in a single room so i could check in forget my ipad later and had some misunderstandings retrieving it as staff insisted it was not found even after using apple device locator and threatening with an official police report it was found don t think it was on purpose but staff could have been a bit more thorough in investigating the issue wifi works very slow not what you expect in this type of hotel
