if you are not here for a convention at the fira then the location has little to offer restaurants in walking distance are mediocre at best i walked for hour through the neighborhood and didn t find anything appealing i ended up at the hotel restaurant if you are not accustomed to the spanish meal times here is the next surprise the hotel restaurant opens for dinner at pm and for breakfast at am both is not very convenient if you have an early start i e flying back to the us early morning breakfast is outstanding though front desk staff was very friendly but relatively slow due to a rugby tournament i paid a hefty per night
