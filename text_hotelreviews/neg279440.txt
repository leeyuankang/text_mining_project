i would not recommend this hotel to those who have tight sleep since i could easily hear trains most probably from deep beneath coming and leaving each few minutes in my room first i tried room bit it was noisy there from street traffic as well anyway most people would not mind that constant noise but for me it took days to get used to it therefore avoid this hotel if you prefer silence during night especially because doors slamming is also quite noisy
