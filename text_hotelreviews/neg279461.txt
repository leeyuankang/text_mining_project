first they wanted to charge us more for our seven year old boy even though the room max capacity was for three people no where in our reservation said there was an extra charge for children we didn t have to pay extra but it was not a good initial impression the a c didn t work and they couldn t make it work either and they did not do much about it we had to ask for our room to be serviced because some days nobody cleaned it there was no tissues in the room and we had to ask for some in the reception in short we wouldn t come back to this hotel nor recommend it to anyone but you can take your chances
