the restaurant let the hotel down it was very expensive for the amount of food that was served we waited minutes to be asked if we would like a drink and an hour between starters and main course in fact we had to ask them were our meals had got to when they arrived the food was cold and so were the plates that it was served on we decided not to go to breakfast
