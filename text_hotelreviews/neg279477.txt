requested a high floor and early check and neither was met little out the way from the city centre taxis everywhere all added up about walk from camp nou not really any supermarkets nearby to buy refreshments as the hotel was quite pricey around walk to the closest would maybe stay near les rambles gothic quarter next time we got a taxi from the airport to the hotel which cost on the way back we wanted to take a bus or metro but the hotel staff told us there was no bus service from the hotel we could get a metro but it would take metros and an hour travel time which i didn t understand because it was only in a taxi we opted for the taxi and it was just on that journey which was more reasonable that having said all that i would return to this hotel but would maybe seek other options also
