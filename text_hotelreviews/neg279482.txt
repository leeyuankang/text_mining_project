i booked this hotel for my two very senior colleagues on a business trip because it was close to the bullet train station the office they were visiting it seemed bigger than the average size a stars hotel and had good reviews after the first night they asked me to move them to another hotel as there were all kinds of small but inconvenient issues the air con appeared to be working but the room was not getting any cooler shower had low pressure the room seemed a bit outdated breakfast wasn t nice etc i had two rooms booked for days one of them a suite i asked the hotel to cancel the other nights and keep one night as cancelation fee that s the policy if you cancel less than hours before the stay and on booking com it appeared that it can be cancelld anytime if you pay one night print screen attached they refused saying we can check out but pay the remaining nights for each of the rooms i sent emails to booking com with print screen of the reservation that seems to show this cancelation policy they did not have any answer they just encouraged me to take photos of the room so we can convince the hotel that the room is inappropiate i can t really take photos of shower pressure and temperature my boss who was actually staying at the hotel had business meetings all day and didn t want to interact with them so he asked me his pa to negotiate with the hotel i made the booking from my account i handle all his travelling arrangements especially abroad outside japan the hotel refused the request because the person actually staying in the room did not report directly despite telling them many times through the booking com customer center that i m their assistant who made the booking the people actually staying don t have the available time foreign language ability disponibility to negotiate with them
