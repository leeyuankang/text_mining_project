paying for room on arrival payment on check in at this hotel is policy and in my opinion is not acceptable for a star internationally positioned hotel the front office staff are invested with insufficient authority to be able to waive this condition if you don t like it and if you put your foot down they just call the hotel manager escalating this request just makes for a fretful confrontational check in and taints the hospitality policy of the hotel a big negative
