very hard bed room was part of a conjoined room on the corner of building resulting in bad view from windows of hotel balconys of opposite hotel house keeping noisy at times and food in panaramic restaurant was limited and not very nice would of had better food in downstairs bar so this was disappointing on arrival we weee met by a lovely member of staff who we thought checked us in and took payment however when returning to get room keys it turned out our details had been lost frustrated staff bickering in front of us and i feel the room we were given was not to the standard expected for the price paid
