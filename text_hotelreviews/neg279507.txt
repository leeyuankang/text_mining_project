at check in i was asked if i wanted to pay in dollars or euros in the moment i chose dollars but looked at my statement after and realized that it would be less if i chose euros i asked the front desk to change the charges and they would not also when we first got to our room there were pubic hairs on the toilet seat and a blood stain on the wall by the toilet paper dispenser which means the housekeeping does not clean well upon check out the front desk insisted that i ate breakfast and i had charges in my bill so when i asked to see the sign in seat they reversed the charges
