well there was a great idea which was an ice machine in the hallway that would fill a water bottle with water and ice however when i tried it it didn t work and the machine itself was full of dirt when i call down to the desk they said it hadn t worked in a number of years so if they re going to do something like that why not get it working otherwise everything was great
