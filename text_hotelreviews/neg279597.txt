the only disadvantage that i have strongly noticed is a prominent smell of the air freshener in the lobby spinning door it is nice to see that you would like your guests to have a great experience in your hotel but this smell is definitely too much also the ice machine did not work and you have to call room service for ice which is not a problem at all but passing not working ice machine everyday is probably not the image that you want your visitors to have about your hotel
