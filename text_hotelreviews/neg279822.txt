electric tea kettle in the room would be nice there was only a coffe maker and although it was possible to use it as hot water dispenser the water was not enough hot to make a good tea and it had a taste of coffe which i don t like it was a pity that the terrace was closed for reconstruction it looked fantastic and it would be great to have a drink there
