there was no working pool but is mentioned on the website the jacuzzi was full of dirt so we didnt get to use any of those facilities we also asked the staff on the day we arrived that the safe has been closed by previous people who were in our room and he mentioned that they will come sort it out but unfortunately wasn t sorted until we left so we couldn t secure our valuables in a safe place
