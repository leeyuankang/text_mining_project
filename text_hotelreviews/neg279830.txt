we arrived at the hotel after a charity bike ride cycling from manchester we also arrived on our wedding anniversary and the hotel were aware of both nobody acknowledged either i wasn t after flowers or champagne an acknowledgement would have been sufficient in addition my sister arranged for a delivery to our room of cava and beer to be there on our arrival it didn t arrive until she chased it when we checked out the receptionist also divulged how much it cost for the cava beer as our bill was incorrect and had to be recalculated unprofessional
