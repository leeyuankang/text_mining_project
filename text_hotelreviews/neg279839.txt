the rooms were tiny i mean couldnt even open our suitcase tiny the bed wasnt even a double more like one of those beds and yet that was so uncomfortable the hotel itself is a short walk to the train station but also situated next to a prison about mins walk into barcelona city centre limited food places nearby not what i would call a by any means we didnt bother with the pool which was the main reason why we booked here seen deeper padderling pools glad we relocated nearer to the city which weirdly has bigger rooms
