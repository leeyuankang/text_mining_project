i didn t like the standard room which we initially were given it didn t seem like it should be in a hotel not to mention the bed was creaky and wasn t properly attached to the wall i d recommend if staying here you should opt for the superior room it s very much a bedroom though perhaps my experience of the standard room isn t what they re all like i m not sure also there didn t to be much happening in the area around the hotel like bars restaurants etc this made the sans station nearby so necessary
