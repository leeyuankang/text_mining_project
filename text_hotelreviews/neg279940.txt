our room key kept not working so we had to go to the reception everytime we wanted to get into our room we were on the floor it was quite far from the city centre but was close to the magic fountain etc the aircon didn t work properly and the room was really warm and humid throughout the night bathroom tiles were smashed in and just looked really worn out it was expensive for what it was
