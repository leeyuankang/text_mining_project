room service food excellent in the middle of the week dont try on weekends as it is terrible missing ingredients which were rectified after we complaine told by waiter it was first time he had prepared this then told us he couldn t make dessert we d ordered as he didnt know how to we asked if anything else off dessert menu could be ordered he said no we were totally shocked by what we experienced this is simply not good enough for the price paid for this hotel
