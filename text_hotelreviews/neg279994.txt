reception staff went missing when the lobby was busy with guests looking to check in and check out we waited ages to check out with only one receptionist on duty we expected the swimming pool on the roof to be quite small but we didn t expect to touch both sides at the same time it was barely big enough for two people for a hotel we didn t expect rust on the side of the bath or the door frames be be badly water damaged the cleaners were very stingy with replenishing the soap and shampoo we had to go out and buy our own
