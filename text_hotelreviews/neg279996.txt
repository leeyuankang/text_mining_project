the wifi was awful extremely slow and rubbish connection also considering i paid almost for nights i did find the actual duvet was stained and the fact not even one channel was in english was sad i found brown stains on the carpet around various areas in the room despite all these issues i must say the friendliness all staff from the cleaners to the waitress that we met in the morning made it difficult to complain
