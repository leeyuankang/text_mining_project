many staff members do not speak or understand english it was hard to communicate with them when we wanted to put a few request such as a mattress for our baby cot what disappointed us the most is that they offered us deflated and molded floaters for our months old baby girl when they pride themselves as a stars hotel when we requested to have a new one since we were staying several days there the staff asked us to go buy and get our own definitely not the type of service i was expecting from the melia hotel chain
