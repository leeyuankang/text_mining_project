the hotel is getting old they are trying to keep it up to date but for a star hotel i expect everything to be perfect and it was not perfect at the time of booking we were happy to see that there is a spa but when we wanted to use the spa facilities we were told that it is per person per day in addition to our daily rate it was not mentioned anywhere during the booking process that the spa will cost us extra each day the other downside is that the hotel is about min walk to la rambla but is only for a taxi
