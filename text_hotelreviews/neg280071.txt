very poor tea and coffee making facilities just small milk pots in the room and coffee sachets we had a coffee on arrival and again when we came back to the room at night and then nothing left for the morning mega expensive breakfast mini bar and room service astronomical maybe ok for business men but not recommeokded for ordinary visitors to the city
