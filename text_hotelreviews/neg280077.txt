the use of trainees at the front desk is a concern for example we wanted to use the express checkout which we understood meant checking out the night before we did this through a trainee who did not seem to understand the process she only checked us out for the nights we had already been at the hotel so we had to checkout the next morning anyway to pay for that last night no time savings at all in addition the trainee told us our boxed breakfasts would be delivered to our room at am yet they went to the front desk we would have appreciated having something to eat
