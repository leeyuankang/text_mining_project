here are the points that i am very disappointed the shower door were missing and the door supports were sharp and were left there this might have caused injuries the bath door had a problem in closing and it is moving freely instead of closing the air conditioning was not working the iron board was in an un acceptable condition and the most disappointing i had mold in my room this is outrageous for a hotel mold is a danger for health and can cause health issues
