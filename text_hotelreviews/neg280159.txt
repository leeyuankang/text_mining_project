the room looks nice in the pictures with the big windows but in reality it is surrounded by wooden bars that make it feel like a cage windows give on the street so if the curtains are open everyone can see you especially with the tourist bus stopping right in front of the room there was dust in the room and the corridor was only cleaned once when we were there a week there is a big plasma tv in the room but no channel in english so we only watched youtube videos the staff was cold and made us feel unwelcome every day even if we stayed a week and even if the hotel was empty they didn t know our name and we had twice the reception staff looking at us and asking what we were doing there and if we were staying at the hotel each time we said seriously we think that because this is one of the most famous restaurants in barcelona they care more about the restaurant guests than the hotel ones one evening we went to the lounge and the staff told us we dont serve food and we have no drinks menu when i asked if we can have a drink he said what do you want and we will prepare it then his colleague came with a drink menu we later saw them distributing food and understood that the lounge is used for the starters of the restaurant tasting menu and as we were not going to the restaurant we disturbed their service and were not welcome after days we asked if we can cancel the rest of the stay but they said that even if we had a free cancellation rate that is only applicable if we cancel before a week and that we would need to pay for the rest of the days anyway as it s the hotel policy so not negotiable so we finished our stay there feeling trapped in prison and were shocked that no one asked us not even once why we thought about leaving and how was our experience even when we checked out they didnt ask for any feedback which confirmed that they didnt care
