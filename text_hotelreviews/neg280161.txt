we paid extra for a room with a private terrace but the terrace is anything but private there are windows overlooking the terrace from all angles there is a public walkway with a bench directly opposite the terrace and a direct view from a bus stop where open top hop on hop off tour buses stop every few minutes we didn t use the sun loungers on our terrace because of this this was described as a quiet location but it s right next to a busy and noisy main road and junction again we didn t use the terrace to relax because of this and i had to shut the terrace door at night because the traffic sounds woke me up we had read reviews of the restaurant and splashed out on a tasting menu with wine pairing this was beyond disappointing the food was so bad that we felt we were forcing ourselves to eat it out of politeness and on some of the courses we just couldn t finish it at all the menu is very fish dominated i love fish but the taste of the fish here was strong and pungent for example the first course came with a soup of plankton the extreme fishiness of the plankton was so overpowering that that s all i could taste for the next courses then the corn tacos had such an extreme saltiness it tasted like someone had dropped the top off the salt when they were preparing it i could go on as a general rule i prefer not to feel like i m gagging when eating a meal on the plus side the wine pairings were awesome i think it was this fact alone that got me through the meal and the presentation of the food was very nicely done the quality of service at the hotel was varied the lady who checked us in was very accommodating friendly and professional but when we ordered room service and dealt with someone else we asked for a drink and were told no just take something from the mini bar which wasn t very helpful as this didn t have the drink we wanted
