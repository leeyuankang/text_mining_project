the only thing i didn t like about the colon was the fact that breakfast wasn t included in the room rate and the room rate is significant from memory the hotel wanted to charge an extra euro for a continental breakfast consequently we went out for breakfast every morning so the hotel missed out on our business there are plenty of reasonable breakfast options in the area this meant that we never actually ate at the hotel as we went out for dinner every evening as well there is an outstanding restaurant nearby called neyras which we went to instead and it was terrific great food and wine at very reasonable prices the hotel colon recommended the restaurant to us in the first place lucia looked after us most evenings she is lovely
