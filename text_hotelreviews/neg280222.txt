there was a marathon scheduled to run right in front of the hotel sunday morning so we left very early in order to get a taxi to the airport since the whole area was closing down just an fyi check for local festivals etc the area is busy and noisy with the cathedral bell tower chiming regularly but the hotel has very good windows that really keep out the noise just don t plan on keeping the windows open on a saturday night if your room faces the cathedral plaza
