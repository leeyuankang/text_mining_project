room was quite spare no luggage racks no bathtub although one was advertised on booking com we did have a lovely walk in shower however no info on calling reception or wake up call no air conditioning in the hotel after and our room was stuffy very good hotel overall but expected a bit more for the money also didn t think the service was especially friendly except for the fabulous bell hops who helped us hail a taxi and helped us with our luggage
