my room faced the interior atrium a small area inaccessible to guests all interior rooms have a view of this space i didn t spend much time in my room but those planning to do so may want to spring for the pricier rooms on the exterior side there is a rooftop terrace with a gorgeous view open to all guests but it is only open from so early morning coffee or a late night cocktail with a view is not an option additionally be aware that the pool is little more than a wading pond and there are only a few deck chairs in the pool area this is typical for many european hotels but the photos on the website are slightly misleading
