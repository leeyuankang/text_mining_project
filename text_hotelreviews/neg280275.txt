we did not eat breakfast at the hotel as we were told it was not included when we checked in however as we checked out we were told it was included lots of little places close by to have coffee and people watch in the morning better then sitting in the basement for breakfast at the hotel but we would not have paid for breakfasts each day if we had known it was included the wine selection in the bar was not very good if you wanted only a glass of wine bar staff not so friendly
