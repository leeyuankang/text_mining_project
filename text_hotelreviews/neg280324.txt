because of the central location there was tons of street noise all night in addition to that the hotel is completely renovating the first floor which means there is a significant amount of noise between we were directly above the noise and it was so bad we couldn t stay in for even a short break from sight seeing we asked for another room but they were booked so they gave us free breakfast which is euros normally breakfast was terrible very over priced and totally not worth it staff were not very friendly not rude just not friendly at all i wouldn t stay here again also they should not be booking the second floor rooms when so much construction is going on on the first floor
