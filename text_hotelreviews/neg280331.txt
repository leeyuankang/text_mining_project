staff were not apologetic when on arrival they had given travelling friends a room with a double bed when clearly our booking requested a room with twin beds they did not acknowledge their mistake nor did they offer an apology they just said we fixed the problem and gave us a noisy twin room on the first floor with a view of the trees planted outside the window we had paid for a cathedral view no street map no attraction brochures offered just rudeness from the staff who just talked over you and could not see why we were unhappy constantly replying we fixed the problem we left the next day to a beautifully furnished hotel with delightful helpful staff and in a better location winners
