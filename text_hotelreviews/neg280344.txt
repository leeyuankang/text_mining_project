upon check in georgio looked at my wife and i and then told us that i had booked a single room with a single bed and i should have booked a double room he insisted that there is no such thing as a single room with a double bed and unfortunately they were full and had no double rooms yet after a few minutes he found a double room for euros more a few minutes after that while i was planning what in the hotel i was going to destroy first he finally found me the miraculous and elusive single room with double bed at the booking com price my advice watch out for this trick and make sure bed size is specified loud and clear somewhere in the booking
