we were very disappointed that a very ugly large book fair took place outside the cathedral many little wooden huts which marred the view our main reason for booking at this hotel was the the beauty of the cathedral in front of us as in pictures and brochures of the hotel i believe they should have let us know that this was happening and it may well have caused us to look elsewhere it also brought many vagrants and unsavoury people into the vicinity of the hotel one particular arrogant front desk person looked as though it was an effort to assist us with taxis and in a nutshell it was not the family hotel we expected
