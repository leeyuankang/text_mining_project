extraordinarily rude young front desk person who said and i quote this is not america this is spain when i asked if he could assist in finding a high quality restaurant for dinner at ridiculously short notice something that i went to pains to say i knew was unlikely but that i wanted to try none the less apart from the insulting commentary the fact that i am not american and the fact that i was initially very polite have had a home in spain for years and speak fluent spanish seems to have escaped him when i tried to explain in as nice a way as my odd years have taught me to do he just rolled his eyes like i was an idiot honestly then i was not so polite as this ex ceo of major global bank might be an idiot but at least i am not a year old front desk junior being rude will never stay at this hotel again and an apology from this hotel s management is undoubtedly due to me and all the american s who stay there
