the wooden furnitures for the tv doors were old and look rather run down need refurbishing the breakfast was sufficient however not too variety for daily basis same menu every day shld have different menu on different days and we were there for days so it gets rather repetitive the hot towel rack is not working the chair legs for sitting down in room was somehow loose and sideway the design of the chair legs are not safe friendly as it s jutting out thus many times accidentally kicked it
