a group of about men in their thirties at the pool drunk and yelling during the afternoon this lasted at least hours after that we left tired of it so we could not use the pool and could not rest in our room either since my room was facing the pool on the floor i ask for the manager but i was told he was in a meeting later i asked again no more success therefore i could only address the front desk who told me these guys were also customers so there was nothing they could do details the carpet in the corridor is dirty the hotel overall does not deserve stars
