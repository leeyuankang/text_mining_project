had problems with our shower a new hose was installed and it was way too short so we had to hold it above our heads they replaced it the following morning though without any problems i would look out of our window over the pool every morning i thought it was funny that the same english people went shuffling down to throw their towel over their sunbeds they d then go off to breakfast i find this very selfish and unfair to other residents i arrived the same time as a few hen do s they were all well behaved until in the morning when they came back drunk and with no respect for others this is not a reflection on the hotel at all as they have signs up asking people to show respect if they come back late
