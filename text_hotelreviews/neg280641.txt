i stayed at this star hotel for nights in may there was of us so we had rooms one being a junior suite my room was for the stay firstly i d like to say that this is not a star hotel it s dated dirty over priced and the service is poor in every area the rooms are okay basic a bit ugly and dated it felt like they were rushed to be finished bad painting jobs wonky canvases etc etc but there is a good size tv a wardrobe with a safe a mini fridge etc the beds are quite comfortable but the air conditioning is awful and the cleaning service was quite poor the bathroom in particular didn t feel clean at all and it smelt a bit funny too one day we were left without towels and toilet paper my parents had the junior suite room which was not a suite any suite room usually provides rooms or areas a bedroom and an area with a sofa and a tv the only difference in the suites is that they are a bit bigger they also had terrible issues with the heat in their room and described it as dirty and uncomfortable over for nights the reception and restaurant inside is okay quite dated and a bit cheap worn but the pool area is nice and there s a large and very pleasant seating area for food and drinks outside one night we had some tapas from the restaurant which wasn t great pretty sure it was all bought frozen stuff but the cocktails were pretty yummy each we also had breakfast every day at per person per day it was quite nice but not really what you would expect for good bread some mini pastries meats eggs bacon yogurts etc but bad coffee from a hospital waiting room kind of machine
