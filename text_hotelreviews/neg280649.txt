way too overpriced for such a generic place gym is a joke rooms are very basic and stuffy internet is awful and they said there was a hot tub which there really isn t the location is hit or miss depending on what you want near the water which is amazing but far away from the action so you have to constantly take transit depends what you want overall i do not normally write reviews especially poor ones but i was very dissatisfied with the hotel especially for the price they charge it s not worth it in my opinion
