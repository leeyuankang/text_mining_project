all of our party adults all agreed that despite a good selection of food the buffet breakfast was spoiled by virtue of the hot food not being kept warm enough in the respective trays etc overall the service in the restaurant was poor upon leaving and settling our accounts payment for the dinner on our first evening was still outstanding despite the fact we had all paid cash this was eventually accepted by the management
