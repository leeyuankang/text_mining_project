there was nothing star about this place when we arrived there wasn t a soul at the reception floor no help was given with the luggage and the floors windows were dirty but that s nothing compared to the family room we were given for us and our children each time you opened or closed the bathroom door the whole lot of planks on the bathroom ceiling went up fell back down due to the change in the pressure making a huge noise similar to that of a building collapsing to top that up the noisy bathroom fan never went off the whole night there was mould around the shower and you could smell the damp throughout the room there was no duvet instead there was a very old blanket in between the sheets when we asked for the manager a girl whose outfit looked no better than the duvets with creased trousers and worn off shoes no make up came to the room she said we would ve sent the technical team to the room during the night we then spoke to the general manager who offered only to take euros off the we had paid breakfast was no different from the rest of the service we can cancelled our second night and left for another hotel with the kids this place should be shut as it s not managed properly at all
