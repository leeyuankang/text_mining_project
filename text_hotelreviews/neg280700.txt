i travelled with my year son as this hotel is in a residential area and some of the buildings where rundown of a night it felt very isolated as a first time visitor to barcelona and with no other obvious signs of life i didn t feel safe to explore of an evening even the next morning the directions i was given to the tour bus by hotel reception staff took us down deserted streets as you can imagine i was more than a little disappointed in my choice of location the room also had water damage by the minibar i didn t see it until the second day i m just sorry i didn t take a picture the room was i paid for breakfast one day only i wouldn t recommend it it wasn t value for money per person regardless of age no child reduction but i have a fussy eater who wanted beans on toast he ate some of it then refused to eat anymore as a fly landed on his plate pan chocolate has a soggy buttom only one of the coffee machines worked
