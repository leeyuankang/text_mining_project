we were visiting in late september and there was major street construction all around the hotel it made it difficult for us to find it and then figure out how to park in the garage also although it is close to the beach which didn t really matter at this time of the year it is so far from everything else if i knew better i would have stayed closer to the gothic quarter or las ramblas restaurant didn t seem to be a good value for the money
