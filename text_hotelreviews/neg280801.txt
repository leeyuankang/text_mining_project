we booked a room of people and the third bed was a poor exuse of a bed mattress was thin and had a massive dip inside it also the springs dig into your back after the staff failing to change the bed even after the promised the would we ended up sleeping people on a bed of the most disappointing service i have experineced the staff caused alot of confusion with this and communication was poor between the front desk staff and house keeping we also asked the staff to ring a restaurant they told us they called and found out they dont take reservations we took a taxi there and found the restaurant was closed
