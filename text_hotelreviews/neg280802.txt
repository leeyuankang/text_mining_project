at check in they requested the payment for the total stay for both rooms this was the first hotel throughout my experience that did it next day i knew why woke up on an unbelievable hammering drilling knocking sound underneath our room kids were scared and i couldn t believe what was happening heavy duty road construction at the street right in front of the hotel not the hotels fault but also not our fault to travel thousands of miles and spend thousands of euros at the hotel to end up sleeping in a war zone hotel should have announced about the construction and should have sold the rooms half price or close them till construction ends after objecting the second day to the reception they moved us into a room with no air conditioning we informed the reception but no help they insist that it is working on the system staff always put you under the impression that you are a liar they say maintenance staff not available we moved back to a room at the street with the same construction noise hotel lacks maintenance and no ventilation in bathrooms air conditioning system is useless to make a long story short sb icaria spoiled our long awaited vacation in barcelona and advise all to think thrice before booking at sb icaria i will never forgive them for ruining my stay
