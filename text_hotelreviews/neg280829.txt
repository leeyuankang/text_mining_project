we sent an e mail asking for a spescific room and the hotel promised that they would do their best to give us the room when we arrived the man in the reception told us that it had never been an option for us to get the room very disappointed i guess they just answer requests with standard polite phrases it s a kind of service i don t appreciate strange smell mold inn the corridor rooms are a bit outdated but ok if you don t need to spend much time there a bit too expensive given the location and standard but taxi is cheap and always available
