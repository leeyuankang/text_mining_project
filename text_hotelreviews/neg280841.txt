both poolside showers were not safe and could fall over one of these also had a broken show head the pool area wasn t cleaned until i spoke to the reception there was a band of dirty oily residue around the pool above the water line and this was finally cleaned when the surrounding paving area was cleaned there is no shade around the pool which can be a problem whilst there are ice dispensing machines on all floors they make a lot of noise and at night you get this noise in your room i think they could do with being replaced for something quieter
