i was a little bit disappointed with this hotel if i m honest i read lots of reviews on the net but when we arrived we had a massive stain facing our room on the carpet which was slowly approaching our room we told reception about this problem but nothing was done until our last day also a strong smell of cigarette smoke was lingering outside our room for the whole duration of our stay again we spoke to reception about this and they just said ok we travelled with our baby daughter and that was the concern regarding the smoke smell i was also looking forward to using the sauna and steam facilities but they were both out of order i stayed in january i had the feeling because it was out of season the hotel wasn t up to the standards it probably would be in the summer months
