one of the main reasons we booked this hotel was to enjoy the outdoor hot tub this was turned off during our stay when we asked about it we were told that was the way it was a big disappointment also the shower kept changing temperature resulting in the water getting extremely hot for a couple of moments every minutes not very relaxing
