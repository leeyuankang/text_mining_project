everyday you had to make a decision between surfing on the internet via wifi or lying on your bed to relax the only way to combine these two things together is to move the bed to the gate of the door the wifi signal was terrible in the room from the outside the hotel looked quite morden but the indoor facilities were very old the room was far away from my expectation based on what i have paid and my travel experince in such big cities what experienced was not worth what paid
