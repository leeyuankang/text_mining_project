i have stayed already in this hotel this is why i had made a reservation for nights unfortunatelly this time they gave us a room extremely warm the air condition was not functioning properly wifi also was not ok the door from the bath was difficult to open we change the room next day but this new room was very small also the bed the doors were shut all the night was impossible to sleep i would like leave this hotel the next day but i had to pay for all the nights at the check in i believe the staff could be much more careful when you are staying such a long period
