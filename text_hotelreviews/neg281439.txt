my room faced the street and noise insulation was not good there was a lot of street noise which made it difficult to sleep my room was opposite the lift which was an extra disturbance there was no room service as far as i was aware and i was not given information about the hotel bistro breakfast room my friend stayed in a five star hotel with sea views for the same price so universal was not good value in my opinion
