i asked the reception staff to order me a taxi to the gare nu nord train station but when the car arrived it wasn t a taxi but a app based car such as uber but local if i wanted that type of transport i would ve ordered it myself but since it s there i got on nevertheless the hotel rep said the trip would cost euro and when we arrived the driver showed me his phone and i was shocked to see the number was euro with a remark minutes waiting time of course this is a scam because i didn t make him wait for anything but since he can t speak a single english all he did was point to the bill on his phone so i paid him that s pretty much the tiny dent to the otherwise perfect stay
