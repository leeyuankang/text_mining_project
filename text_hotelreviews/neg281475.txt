everything was good except for that time when i really needed to have a quick nap in the middle of the busy day right when i fall asleep the phone is ringing for some reason the reception lady wanted to ask if i need my room cleaned although i have the do not disturb sign on my door not a big deal of course but a bit inconsiderate for a four star hotel
