the amenities are pretty old and it look like the hotel has not been updated for more than years the bathroom cleanliness was a little bit lacking especially around the bathtub and the shampoo shower gel very low quality the air conditioning did not seem to be working properly as the temperature in the room never decreased below degrees celsius lastly there is a strong smell in the rooms and especially in the hallway
