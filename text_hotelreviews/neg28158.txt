am at a loss to understand how the room we paid for could be descibed as a junior suite it had a comfortable bed with separate bath shower toilet facilities but only had one small chair and small table in the bedroom no separate sitting area unless that was the balcony which might have been fine if weather had been better very nice coffee machine in room but twice we had to ask for coffee pods just to get one each per day
