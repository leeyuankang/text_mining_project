the location in the gothic quarter was good in that it was close to everything however it was difficult to get to by car the main way into the area was blocked off for several of the days that we were staying there also staying in the gothic quarter meant dealing with lots of crowds all of the time next trip to barcelona we would consider a different neighborhood for this reason
