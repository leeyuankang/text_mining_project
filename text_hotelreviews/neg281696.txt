these are not things that would stop us from staying here again just comments for the hotel to consider mattress was a little too hard for my liking we stayed in a family room of us and you want us to reuse towels to assist with saving the environment so then please put up more towel rails hooks in the bathrooms there is plenty of space so please use it wisely
