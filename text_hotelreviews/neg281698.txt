no bar or restaurant onsite despite this being shown as included in the facilities on the booking com website at the time we booked bearing in mind the location this was not a major problem however it had been a deciding factor in our booking and therefore we were disappointed the bar was greatly missed on the very rainy evenings we were extremely unlucky to have rainy evenings though not our normal experience
