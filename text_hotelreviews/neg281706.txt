the automatic glass doors at the entrance are a little inconvenient they can only be opened by an electronic key or by the hotel staff at reception on the side wall it says not to knock on glass door but by the time people see the sign they usually have knocked already and the staff cannot see very well if someone is there to let them in until people actually knock so entrance can be a little tricky and delayed if you don t have your key on you
