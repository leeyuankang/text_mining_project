upon our arrival i wish i would have asked or wish they would have told us that they had a gym with a shower we only discovered this later although our room wasn t ready as expected we arrived at after a long flight it would have been wonderful to take a shower in the gym before heading out to the city as it happened we both changed clothes in the small guest toilet room just off the lobby yet there is a nice sized gym and shower just one floor below worth the money we paid around us for one night and i d say here again this said you can find lots of great places in barcelona for much less so if cost is a factor this may not be for you but there are great options all around
