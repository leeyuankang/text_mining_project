booking a room that was not the room photographed in picture and being told that there is only one of that room in the hotel and that it was taken our room was definately small and not worth almost dollars per night pool and top deck was awkward and small and was divided by plants to other top floor executive suites no privacy for them or myself the hotel rooms are small and the bed so close to the cupboard that you can hardly open the doors without hitting the bed
