nothing that we didn t like enough to make any real point of without sounding like typically miserable sods the lack of a bar has been mentioned previously pah lovely little bar seconds accross the street no place to eat also raised bah the street is littered with lovely little bakeries selling fresh local food in a morning fantastic little authentic places to eat huddled in the surrounding streets the one next door is wonderful as is the little tapas bar just on the street perfect to kick back in with nice local food and a rioja after a busty fun packed day around this amazing city
