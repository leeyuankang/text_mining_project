check in was a nightmare it took forever and they couldn t give me a specific time that the room would be ready i arrived very early in the morning around and didn t expect the room to be ready initially they told me it should be ready around so i left my bag and went out and came back then but i kept on getting a similar response of come back later without them being able to tell me when this kept on until the official check out is when i asked the supervisor why its taking so long to clean the room and i was given some line about this is policy understaffed this is not a hotel in the end the room wasn t that clean either and needed a good vacuuming
