there was no full length mirror in our room the lighting in bathroom looked good but did not light up shaving make up mirror or even main mirror properly as a contact lens and make up user this was of particular discomfort for me as approximately half or your customers are woman these are big oversights slightly nicer china wouldn t go amiss either
