breakfast package scrambled eggs were salty and greasy it was pretty much the same for all the other cooked dishes only good thing is fresh oj to cut the grease get breakfast elsewhere location is great but noisy if your room faces the street you will hear traffic noise so if you get a room where the thermostat to control heat or cooling does not work and you open the glass door for some air be prepared for traffic noise and smell of car exhaust if you get a room along small atrium it is quiet but stuffy for people occupancy
