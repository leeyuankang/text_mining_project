i found some of the staff at reception a bit dull and sour faced to start on arrival guests should be greeted with a smile this sets the scene for the rest of the stay there is a gloomy atmosphere in the hotel and management should take note the shower was in a dark corner of the bathroom no lights on that area and difficult to tell whether you are washing your hair with shampoo or body wash
