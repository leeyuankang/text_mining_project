the cleaning of the rooms was problematic we were away from the room until and the room was not cleaned until then and after they would clean around so if you were at the room at the time you would miss the cleaning service for a day if they did clean always forgot to add the paper and the amenities the indian receptionist was not friendly at all at the limit of being rude
