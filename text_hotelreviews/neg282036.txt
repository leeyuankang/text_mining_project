the room was too small really for three of us an extra bed had just been wheeled into a double room for our year old son the extra bed actually blocked one of the wardrobes and the window so it was a bit awkward moving around furthermore it was unbearably hot in the room at night although only in april there was air con but it didn t work we couldn t open the window because of the noise of traffic outside so difficult to sleep receptionist quite indifferent to our comment on how hot the room was we opted for half board and the food was good but we were offered quite a limited menu which would have been fine for about three nights but not for six coffee not good from a machine and not at all fresh tasting
