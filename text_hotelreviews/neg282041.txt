we visited in february but it was not too cold the hotel only had the heater on in the winter i called to confirm that but the room gets pretty warm during the day and we did not need heating at all it was not possible to have fans without heating or cooling ac we had to open the window to let some cool air in but the street was very noisy the room got stuffy and too warm without ac or an open window we kept the window close for the night but had to get up and open it a couple of times during the night to cool down the room i suppose it d have been perfect in the summer when only the cooling ac is on
