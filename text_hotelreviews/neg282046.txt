the room was incredibly hot no air conditioning to have a bit of fresh air we had to keep door and window open we asked the staff for another room but we didn t get one the room was full of dust and the tiles of the bathroom were dirty black at breakfast the personnel was absolutely unkind and annoying they were rushing continuously to have the tables free on a sunday we have witnessed the scene of a waiter insisting on a client to leave immediately the breakfast room because it was and way beyond the breakfast time all this for eur a night beware
