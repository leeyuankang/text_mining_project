no major gripes at all the bar staff could occasionally come across a bit surly mainly when we were after some tea we are british after all but i think this may have been more due to a little bit of a language barrier and also in comparison to the reception staff who couldn t have been more helpful and seemed fluent in every language that was thrown at them one thing to be made aware of which is good to know because we didn t is that tickets for places like parc g ell and the sagrada familia are based on entrance windows rather than just queuing up to eventually get in not knowing this beforehand created instances where we d arrive at say to be told that the next available entrance time would be which left us with an awkward wait time that didn t give us enough time to go somewhere else and to get back but was also a little bit too long to just kill by mooching about there are only so many times you can look at bar a themed fridge magnets whilst we made the best of it with a little picnic and enjoyed the relax it s the kind of downtime you can t afford if you are trying to see as much as possible in the time you re there especially if it s happening or times my advice would be to spend your first morning day hopping on and off the open top bus booking your tickets day s in advance for the time slots you desire and then you ve got better structure to your trip and can plan accordingly this was our first city holiday together so we ve certainly learned from it if you re a veteran this is probably old news
