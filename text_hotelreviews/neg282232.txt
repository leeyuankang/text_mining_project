i think the restaurant of the hotel could do better the lighting is wrong with no ambiance too bright it is too open as it is next to the reception the prices are a little expensive considering the great restaurants in the area i would think the hotel would do much better if they competed more with these restaurants more food variety more tapas lower prices and a better overall feel to the restaurant its a great space so with the right vibe look and feel and better pricing it will bring in more business staff are great though
