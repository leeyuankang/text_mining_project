i was so looking forward to my five days at the hotel and there were some things that were truly great but it s always those annoying things that ruin a travel experience and for me they piled up a little too much at the olivia balmes readers will have to judge for themselves whether any of these are a deal killer before i arrived i had several back and forth emails trying to get an answer regarding my booking and payment was very frustrated with a few days to go before i left not having my urgent requests answered just ignored my emails in the end i just chanced it that the booking was confirmed and it was one day the lock did not activate and for hours my door was just not locked door was shut but when i arrived back i just pushed it open and realized it had not locked hotel did check it and it worked nothing was taken i love to swim and when i say the photo of the pool i thought it was a huge wonderful rooftop pool it was the main reason i booked it s actually not a pool for real swimming the lens distorts the size and it s actually a very very small barely lap pool not the one you see in the photos if you don t like to hear your neighbors well the walls are quite thin in my opinion my neighbors came in late and when they lay on their bed it banged loudly against the shared wall you hear a lot in the corridor one last thing they change the wifi password every day and you need to collect the new one from reception each morning became a real frustration
