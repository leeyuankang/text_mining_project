i liked most of the staffs they were very friendly except few few staffs seemed very busy so when we booking tickets and didn t know what to book the staff showed a bit annoying and wanted us to decide quickly i didn t want to bother the staff too much because the staff have strong accent so i tried to figure things out and book it quick but this made us not that comfortable i mean
