the family tried to swim in the pool after it open but not only was the pool super tiny but when we swim apparently water were going over the side glass and down floors below on to people trying to have breakfast so we were told to try not to make any splashes until at least for another hour note we were just swimming and not playing water fight or anything that i believe is a design fault the glass should be higher everyone around the pool ended up just staring at it for fear we get water on someone s head and we never went back another small incident also on the first days of our stay was a housekeeper walked in without knocking while i was changing and it happened to both rooms could have at least knock
