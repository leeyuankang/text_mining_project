the pool area is small so over weekends it can be hard to secure a sun lounger i propose they secure some more for the other side of the terrace the location is walkable to the centre but maybe minutes although public transport is easy too i think i d prefer to be more central if and when i return the bathrooms in the bedrooms are wonderful so long as you are familiar with the person you re sharing a room with otherwise you may find the layout and not having a separate enclosed bathroom uncomfortable there is not daily complementary water in the rooms a small thing but makes a difference
