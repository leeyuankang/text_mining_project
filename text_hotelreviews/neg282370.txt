we got an upgrade to a room facing the back of the hotel with a view of the wall the hotell missed that we travelled for my wifes anniversary and since a couple next to our table got a small birthday cake one morning i where a bit surpriced we where charged for one breakfast to many even though we ate outside the hotel so all in all for the money spent on this hotel i think you can find better value for money
