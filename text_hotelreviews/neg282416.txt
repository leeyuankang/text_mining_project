our shower head was leaking so it would spray the room as there is no door so they fixed that right away which was great but the screw attaching the holder to the wall must have been stripped as it would rotate so if the handle was not put back in a certain position it would spray the room some of the finishing in the room looks unfinished the paint in places and the led light strips little details otherwise great
