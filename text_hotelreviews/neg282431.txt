we could not have early check in which i understand but one would think they would take into consideration length of travel and try to expedite check in the bathroom didn t make sense there was no mirror above the sinks the closet in the main sleeping area could not accommodate anything longer than a shirt poor view of an apartment complex with their laundry hanging out i don t agree with the other high ratings it was just a very very average hotel with absolutely nothing special or noteworthy about it i would not stay here again
