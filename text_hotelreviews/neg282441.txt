too much noise from the inside of the hotel it has a structural fault slamming doors that shake walls and bed flushing toilets from other rooms talking guests and screaming children can be heard all the time walls seem paper thin guests on the second floor could hear and feel metro passing under the hotel i felt it in in the shower floor etc if you want to get a good night s rest do not go to this hotel windows are well isolated you cannot hear anything from the street plus the pool is by far not as big as it seems on the photos the photos are a pure lie in this regard
