the rooms are small for a family of four they accommodate the two queen beds a couple of suitcases and not much else that didn t bother us since we were always out but keep that in mind if you are the type to hang out in your room also they should stop calling it a swimming pool it s a swimming sink basically for one family to fit in and that s about it and there is not enough room to actually swim so you get the picture
