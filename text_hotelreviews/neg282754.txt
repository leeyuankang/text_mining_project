parking is small and difficult however the price is half compared to nearby public parking lots if you have a medium or large car or if you plan to use the car every day i would suggest that you pay the extra money for the public parking lot sometimes you can feel the vibration of metro train this is very common in barcelona we didn t use the pool but it s very small for swimming
