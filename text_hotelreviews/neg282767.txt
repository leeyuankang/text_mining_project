we did not get a double room as booked on the website but a single room we got only one key and asking for one more that was the first time when the receptionist realized it is not a double room pretty ridiculous it was a m and two people standing in front of his desk we had to move to a different room but still pay more very bad service the next day they apologized and gave us a nicer room on the floor
