a piece of my jewellery went missing it was an expensive and sentimental bracelet that i left on my bedside table before going to the beach for the day when i returned it has been taken and i didn t assume it was taken until i searched the whole room top to bottom i informed the hotel staff who told me that they would get the housekeeper to look i went back a few hours later to see if there was any good news but unfortunately the hotel staff hadn t noted my problem so no search was made and i was greeted by the rudest man i have ever encountered he may as well have said he didn t give a damn about what i was saying and even abruptly told me to slow down as he couldn t understand my accent i have never recieved such bad customer service in my life not one ounce of concern was given by this hotel member who i believe was the manager and there was no consolation or even an option to be sent my jewellery if it was found overall a horrible experience and put a downer on my whole holiday
