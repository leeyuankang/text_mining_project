terrible hotel my room personally had ceiling boards that fell on me during my stay at the hotel along with water dripping from the ceiling when i alerted the hotel staff about my dripping ceiling they offered me euros off my euro bill they said water damage to my clothes can be washed and the board falling on me was my fault for apparently walking too fast and shaking the walls good to know i have attached photo of a person inspecting the water damage
