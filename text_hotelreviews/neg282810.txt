no where does it mention in the hotel literature that our group read that the hotel is located either directly in top of or immediately next two several metro lines and a railroad line the trains and metros ran until a m and started up again at a m then on saturday night and maybe even sunday i am still so tired from staying there i can t remember if it was sunday night too the metros trains ran all night long metros are wonderful for traveling because they come along every minutes or so but for sleeping or even just relaxing they come with noise and a rocking motion and we had specifically requested in our booking a quiet room we thought airplanes were landing the first night before they told us about the metro the hotel did change us after the first night from the floor to the floor and it was a fraction better but everyone in my group of rooms slept very little the entire days we were in barcelona i personally was only able to sleep at all by pretending that i was in hawaii at the kauai surf hotel and that the noise was huge waves pounding on the cliffs every minute or so honestly that s the only way i could relax enough to sleep the bottom line is the perpetual noise and motion at this hotel should have been made known to us in advance as we would have never booked this particular hotel
