breakfast staff when you arrive for breakfast you feel you entered a different hotel nervous anxious vey uptight you feel like you are intruding i tried to speak to the head of the restaurant to ask if i could sit in the bar area because i had museum tickets and could not take long he abruptly answered something totally irrelevant to my need and took off dismissing me i waited for him and caught him face to face and told him all wanted was to sit at the bar answer oh i didn t understand you solution never returned for breakfast had room service which was perfect
