a little cold in the restaurant though in their defence the weather had changed significantly just within the last day i did make this point and immediately it was dealt with but still it felt cool after half an hour perhaps it could have been where i was sat near the window i asked about the fire in reception it is never lit apparently i was told the remote control had broken i stayed over a year or two back and it wasn t lit then
