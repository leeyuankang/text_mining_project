the extraction fan is broken in the toilet the distance you have to drag cases to the apartment was a concern maybe walk away from the hotel lobby to a completely different block of flats as this would be a daily issue for visitors why not have service like a golf buggy with trailer to get guests cases from a to b hopefully something could be arranged for next time there were of us in our party me my wife and our friend i would have thought our bedroom was going to be seperated from kitch lounge but unfortunetly not so each of us heard every toilet session every snore from our friend and visa versa no privacy even with an appartment be ok if you were sharing with kids but adults
