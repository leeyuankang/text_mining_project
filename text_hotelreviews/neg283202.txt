unfortunately the lift was out of order both in the evening and the next morning having agreed to a room on the top floor the climb for rather ageing people was a bit much help was on hand with our baggage the bathroom window has no blind and faces east so when the sun rose at am it was as if someone had switched on a very bright light we had to improvise a curtain for it annoying in the middle of the night
