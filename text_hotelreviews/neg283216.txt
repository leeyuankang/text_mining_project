the rooms though visually attractive were quite badly thought out the bath was so high that when climbing in and out of it i had to practically jump onto the floor which was wet after a shower because the shower screen wasn t wide enough to keep the water in leaping on one leg onto a wet tiled floor felt a bit dangerous and i nearly slipped several times this is an accident waiting to happen especially considering i am of average height and a shorter person would struggle even more also the lighting in the room was really badly designed there were no side lights by the bed only lights set into the headboard which were extremely dim almost like night lights for children so i had to bring the desk lamp over to read by which then meant the rest of the room was very dark a floor lamp would help solve this problem but ideally the bedside lighting would be better too
