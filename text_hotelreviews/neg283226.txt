we had a flight overseas at and asked for a late check out we were granted this but advised a pounds hour charge would apply which is a bit ridiculous i understand if it is peak season and the room is booked however this was not the case we ve stay in star hotels four seasons fairmont and westin and we have never been charged an hourly rate we stayed for an extra hour and half and was charged accordingly kinda crazy
