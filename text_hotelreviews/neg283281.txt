on check in i was not told or shown where anything was such as the bar restaurant etc my room was quiet dark with the window overlooking offices so i had to draw the blinds while getting dressed which made the room feel even darker the carpet was very stained and there were no slippers available so i had to put socks on while in the room the rooms felt needed a bit of love refurbishment the bathroom has a lot of wood paneling and it had rotted a bit in certain areas felt dated they don t give enough toiletries for two people that felt a bit stingy
