the one and only thing that immediately comes to mind is the bathroom tub shower situation the tub was big but i need a shower i don t like to sit kneel and use the handheld just doesn t work for me i was surprised to see it in such a modern excellent hotel i have encountered these before in europe but usually in smaller or more traditional hotels the hotel is located just inside the london congestion zone we drove from chipping campden to london the enterprise car hire drop off is at st pancras so it was convenient but we were not allowed to idle at the side of to drop off my family and bags which would have allowed an easy turn onto pancras rd for car return so i had to turn onto belgrove st to drop them and turn around which resulted in a congestion zone charge for the mere minutes i dipped into the zone not really the hotel s fault but still a caution
