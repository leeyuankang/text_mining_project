on arriving home from our stay i noticed a decrepancy in my bank accounts they had pre authorised the first nights stay on the sunday before we had even arrived on the monday then in check in they pre authorised the further nights which is fine until we came to check out and go home i paid the final balance if on my card and thats the only receipt i received arriving home i checked my bank and an extra had been taken out separately without for one my consent and secondly unsure as you what or why i rang the hotel to find out why and what it was to be told they couldn t help i had to email the hotel so i emailed straight away on the saturday in the mean time i had checked my bank accounts again and i was missing pound that seemed to be in limbo somewhere after calling my bank it was different pre authorisations from the megaro i rang the hotel again to be told i had to email i already had done they were not helpful at all in dealing with the situation i finally got a message back to say sorry for the inconvenience and they had refunded the and the pre authorisation for the was voided so would return to my bank soon but due to the weekend it may take a while nothing mentioned about the as apparently there is no record of that amount apart from my final balance which is what i paid still waiting for this days after my stay it will be another phone call to the hotel later to try again to solve this problem but i doubt it
