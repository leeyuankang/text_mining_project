i checked in late and upon arrival the r ception staff informed me that i had been upgraded in an annex of the h tel similar to an appartment the aircon was not working hence it was really hot there was a strong damp moisture smell coming from the bathroom which is adjacent to the room i asked to be moved back to a r gular room in the h tel and was answered that it was fully booked not sure then about the upgrade they just offered what was available and it was poor standard to my opinion
