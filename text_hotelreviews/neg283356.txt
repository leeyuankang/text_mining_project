step between the kitchen and living main room is very dangerous and blend with the color of the floor there is no yellow marking or lighting or marking to indicate there is a step once you go from the kitchen to the main room once you enter and i almost failed one time because i failed to notice the step this might be a recipe for an injury from a guest it would be nice to have a thick solid drape or sliding door between the living room where the sofa bed is and where the main bedroom is for privacy sleeping or watching tv when one side want to do something else than the other side it would be nice to have a polished window for the toilet corner it is embarrassing at time to use the bathroom while people see you through the transparent glass door
