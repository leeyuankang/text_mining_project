we did not like that the megaro was overbooked and that we were asked to go to the california to stay one night in hindsight we should have turned them down as the california does not measure up to the megaro it was small stuffy and hot with no ac and other patrons and the neighbourhood were noisy we wanted to shake off the jet lag but didn t do it here it was ok but the megaro was so much better
