whenever i arrive at the megaro it is early to mid morning after a slog of an all night flight from se asia every time they say check in time is every time i say i really can t walk around london for hours till and can they please find a room for early check in every time they manage to but it is something they should do automatically even with full occupancy the night before people will check out at different times and rooms will become available at different times some quite early they will not all become available at the same time at the check in staff need to understand this when a guest arrives early instead of trotting out the check in thing they should understand the guest s needs and set about finding an early check in opportunity every time i push the issue they manage to find one i don t have to push hard but i should not have to push at all if they used their initiative and appreciation of the situation if this happens again it will be the last time i stay there
