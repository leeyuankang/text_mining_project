the noise from the apartment upstairs was a downside i just missed out on the top floor apartment which i will request next time the lights hanging from the ceiling made a chinging type noise from the vibration above when people were walking around this did affect my nights sleep but not enough to put me off staying again on top floor as i am a very light sleeper it may not affect people who are heavier sleepers
