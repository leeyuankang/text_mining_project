after checkout i discovered the hotel had taken extra out of my account which has only been returned days later after contacting the hotel for support i received extremely poor service after waiting days to be contacted a member of staff shouted at me interrupting me and all around providing the worst customer service i ve ever received despite attempts to make contact after this i was completely ignored and still feel it was unresolved and as a result i had to go to my bank who sorted it for me i would only advise staying here if you can afford to pay double what is originally advertised as i ended up with in total out of my account rather than the i expected to pay the staff were awful in dealing with this matter and completely uninterested in anything i had to say despite having evidence from my bank that multiple transactions came out of my account i really cannot mention enough the terrible customer service absolutely disgusted
