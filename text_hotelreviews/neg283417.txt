they didn t inform us that it would be separate appartment in different building on basement floor almost without windows though we planned to have separate rooms and the breakfast was in another building and the waiter in restaurant forgot about the order and disapeared and we were late to the airport as we were waiting for breakfast will not recommend it though the location is good
