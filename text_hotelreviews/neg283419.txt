when i arrived at the time indicated in my booking p m the hotel told me that they have given my room away to other clients after a long trip i was really disappointed about those news what is more selling my room to another customer without even contacting me by phone or at the very least dropping me a message by e mail seemed really unprofessional to me to be fair they offered me a room in a different hotel minutes away by taxi but as i had a very tight meeting schedule and this was in the wrong part of town i respectfully declined will certainly not return to this hotel after this experience despite the good location
