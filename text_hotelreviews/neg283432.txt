these are not criticisms but factors you need to be aware of when you book the hotel fronts euston rd which is busy and noisy even on the sixth floor with the windows closed didn t bother us but a factor to think about the bathroom is large and well appointed with big semi opaque glass doors so not for those who like total privacy the menu in the room implies that it is available all day but it is not at it is highly limited and if you don t eat meat or cheese then you are left with soup and chips good soup and chips but an odd combination still there are plenty of places to eat in the area particularly with the stations opposite
