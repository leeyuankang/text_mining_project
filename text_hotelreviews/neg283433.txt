had to wait for an hour for the the room to be ready although we were given a complimentary drink whilst waiting i was booked in under the wrong name the room was very cold even after visits from the maintenance man who turned it on and off again asked for extra free standing heaters none we re produced when checking out we were asked about our stay told them of experiences guy apologised but no reduction or concession was offered and considering we paid just shy of thought this wasn t very good value all in all probably wouldn t use again
