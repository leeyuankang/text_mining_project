when i book an apartment i check this hotel have lift however when i check in staff told me this sort of room is not in main building but it s ok for us and that building do not have lift we are lucky because our room is in ground floor our luggage are very heavy but i feel unhappy because they didn t give customer current information which about their hotel i think that is very important to all customer heating system too noisy because of apartment is not in main building when we call reception they took long time to our room
