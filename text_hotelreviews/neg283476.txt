we didn t realize when you book a room and an apartment that these would be in completely separate buildings and although minutes walk apart it meant our group wasn t together also the one bedroom apartment we booked was for of the group and stayed in the hotel room the one bedroom isn t a one bedroom as there is no door on the bedroom just a large oval opening so the person using the sofa bed was practically next to the couple in the bed like a room with two queens so neither had any privacy but the worse thing was the toilet and shower doors opened straight into their so called bedroom and the toilet door was see through glass so you could see the person on the toilet from their bed definitely not a good arrangement for sharing and some couples on their own would also find this rather strange from the shower you either had to dry and dress standing in the wet shower or move across to the see through toilet to dress or ask the couple to leave the room so you could get changed just really didn t work for us at all these rooms are better for someone on their own
