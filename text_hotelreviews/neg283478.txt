we stay at a studio unit with kitchen and separate toilet the deign look fashion and new but not quite functional feel like a designer with not much house work experience for example the faucet water can easily spill out of basin the shower water so powerful that almost flood out of shower room the kitchen sink button is almost flat hard to drain and collect waste properly either case create difficulty of maintenance
