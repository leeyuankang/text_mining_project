the front desk staff who checked us in was not friendly and talked to us like we were his student the reservation was a junior suite but it was actually a double bed plus a sofa bed in the double bed room a suite is misleading in addition there were only two glasses for brushing teeth in the bathroom and two glasses for drinking water while we were a group of three i called the front desk and the same staff answered the phone he insisted that there were no glasses in the bathroom and even there were the hotel would not provide an extra glass for brushing teeth to us i requested him to come to the room to show him what glasses in the bathroom i was referring to and he agreed so i then put down the phone without saying another sentence he came to the room after mins with one glass for drinking water he then insisted that the hotel would not provide the glass in the bathroom after i showed him that there were two glasses in the bathroom i was so shocked at his answer and i did not want to argue further with him before i closed the door he turned around and said to me next time when you finish talking on the phone you should say goodbye before putting down the phone at first i did not understand what he meant but then i realised that he actually complained about me putting down the phone without saying goodbye how ridiculous is that i think he forgot that i was the guest and he was the staff i did make a complaint when i checked out and the female manager did apologise to me however this really affected our mood staying in this hotel
