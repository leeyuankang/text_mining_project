the stay had been going pretty well we decided to go to disneyland on one of the first days we got to paris on our last day in the hotel the cleaners took the presents souvenirs that we both from disneyland we advise the reception about this straight away and the said they would ask the cleaner about it the next day and send me an email as we were leaving a few hours later i waited days to hear something back from the hotel and received nothing i then took it upon myself to email them and they replied saying there is nothing they can do and that i have no proof they took anything i did not find this an acceptable or professional response i replied to their email and have still yet to hear back from them two weeks later i would not recommend this hotel as i find it uncomfortable to think that someone was going through my things took something that wasn t there s and to be told i ve no proof will definitely not be going back
