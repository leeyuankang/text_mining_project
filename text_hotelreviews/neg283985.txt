i knew about this in advance and it was fine for me as i wasn t intending to spend much time relaxing in the room but some people might not like the fact there was no external window the window was onto the foyer which meant keeping the curtains shut for privacy there are sofas in the central lobby though so you could sit and read there as an alternative i ate in the restaurant once and i have to say the food wasn t all that impressive
