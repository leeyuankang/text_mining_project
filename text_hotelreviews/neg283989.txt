unfortunately the cost for adding on breakfast was very expensive almost euros and not quite worth the cost additionally we were completely unaware there would be a city tax of approx when we arrived also the room faced inwards a nice idea but meant curtains were closed most of the time and therefore no natural light at all in the room we can t complain as the room was lovely but it wasn t clear online that this would be the case
