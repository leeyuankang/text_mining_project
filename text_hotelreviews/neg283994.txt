there were no windows in any of the hotel rooms at all there was air con but i feel that some people would not book if they knew this up front it may have made me change my mind before we stayed but it was ok to be fair i also had a query on my bill which i emailed the hotel about they sent a copy through to me but on a further query regarding items charged to our room i have heard nothing it seems it is not up for discussion service was extremely slow for breakfast and waiter service outside to the point that we had to leave without our drinks arriving before we headed out hence i feel this was one of our extra charges to our room even though we did not receive them and could not find a waiter to cancel the order
