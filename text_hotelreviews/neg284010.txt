breakfast was average they never informed us we could order ala carte we had to figure this out ourself and missed one morning as a consequence the waffle was very good though the worst part though was the fact that they charged me when i booked even though it was stated very clearly that i shouldn t have to pay until i got there getting the hotel to reimburse the money was a hassle and they were not easy to work with however i did get free breakfast as compensation also when you make your booking email the hotel and try to get a room with a window with daylight half the rooms don t have any natural light and a quite dark as a consequese i booked a more expensive room thinking i d get a window with daylight and i didn t and ended up switching rooms
