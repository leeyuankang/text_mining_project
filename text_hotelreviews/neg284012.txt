for this price you d expect actual windows not just a window out to the hall if you like to sleep with windows open or like fresh air book elsewhere the room is rather small but we were informed we were upgraded to a superior room with a larger bathroom due to our category being fully booked the bathroom was indeed rather large boasting a shower and a bath which i find unnecessary on a short trip i d gladly have exchanged the tub for a proper window we didn t opt for the breakfast as you can easily get something excellent for less money on your walk into town
