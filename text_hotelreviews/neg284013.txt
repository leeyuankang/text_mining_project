on arrival at the hotel the receptionists were unwilling to proceed with check in unless we produced the credit card the trip was booked with i booked months previous and since changed my credit card so could not do so after minutes of arguing and some instruction from a boss we were eventually allowed to check in not a great start but thankfully things improved from there hotel seemed slightly further out from the city than we anticipated however once we had mastered the tram system this was not a problem it was approx minute walk from central station we learned the hard way although we seen plenty of the city along the way
