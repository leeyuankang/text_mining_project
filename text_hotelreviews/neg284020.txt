the junior suite that we stayed in had a number of paint chips on the walls it made things look pretty tacky and was not a sign of quality the beds were tidied and not made on the three nights that we stayed the tea and coffee items were not replaced at all which meant when we wanted a drink there was nothing to have the toilet was in a cupboard i m aware that it was in a historical building the doors did not close properly and did not offer privacy there was no air system there should have been some comfortable addition to the flooring in the bathroom bar the concrete no mention was made when we booked on the ongoing work outside generally the room was not comfy and was a little austere
