building works going on guests were provided with ear plugs but i think a little extra than that should be provided for being disturbed whilst on a holiday wine and olives that were left beside the kettle were charged as mini bar items it costs in a taxi to get to this hotel from central station extra for breakfast is way too steep the front desk booked a taxi for us vip taxis and the company turned out to be very expensive for what was promised to be a maximum journey advise them to book you a regular cab whilst you are staying there
