not my first stay at this hotel this time i was really disappointed and did not enjoy the stay there are construction works at the hotel which start in the morning cleaning in the rooms it was not nice to find the white pillow lying on the floor and the top of the garbage box over my clothes i put the do not disturb sign to avoid anything similar the next day brought my dress to the reception desk thursday evening monday morning found out that it has not been sent to the laundry yet hopefully the lady from the reception working that day tried her best to speed up the process anyway i could not wear it for the business dinner as it was planned problem with booking we agreed before my arrival with the booking team about the details of my stay but receptionist did not have a clew and there were any marks in the system and i had to pay for my last night euros more that it was planned in advance
