the room is without window impossible to know the weather outside and day night the double bed is combined with two single bed impossible to sleep with your partner the room is seperated with outside by a glass wall you can hear everything outside also means people outside can hear everything inside lack of privacy for couples the staff is not so friendly they seldom greet customer even you walk in just in front of them they didnt give any advices or information about the hotel and nearby we found there are plenty of nice resturants and a food court just next to the hotel on the last day
