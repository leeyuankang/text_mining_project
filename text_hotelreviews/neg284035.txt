we had no bottle of water on our room but the barkeeper gave us one for free so not a big deal we had no proper door just a folding door to the toilette which was ok in general but the toilette made a quite loud noise during the whole night which was a bit annoying but these were just very small things which wouldn t stop me to fully recommend this hotel
