in our check out we were charged a city tourist tax euros per night and we had no idea for this also i found the breakfast p p a bit expensive although this is what most hotels charge the room wasn t very clean and in one occasion it hadn t been cleaned until p m besides our room was in the ground floor and it was noisy some nights because of the people in the hotel s restaurant finally some of the staff members could be more kind not all some of them were fantastic
