staff at reception was uninviting we arrived too early room wasnt ready receptionist steph was in bad mood maybe and she was not concerned at all told us to come back took our bags and ignored us after no smile no hello how was ur trip it was off putting the other girl next day paid more attention and had excellent approach this one girl made very bad impression the other con is that bicycle rent is so expensive euro per day there is local shop next to hotel that rents for hotel should make more effort to lower price we stayed in hoxton before and bikes were free also l find it rude when staff chatt to eachother in dutch when client is in front of them girls were making arrangements and us and group of other people were english speakers pointing at client and saying things in dutch comes across as quite rude thats just few observations
