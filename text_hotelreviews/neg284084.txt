the description said window facing court yard but failed to say that it meant glass wall towards hallway the room lacked window which strangely enough didn t bother us on the contrary it made the room secluded and peaceful we lacked hangers for towels and there should have been more than one soap one night the staff forgot to turn off the up beat music in the hallway which was of course disturbing at breakfast the staff was not really on their toes for another star dirty dishes left behind etc the neighbourhood was okey though nothing special veggie market in adjacent street
