as soon as we arrived reception staff informed us that we could not check in because they overbooked the hotel and that they would send us to another one but not as nice as this one however we eventually checked in but when we went to the room we realised that the room was just a standard one and not the deluxe one i booked months in advance we confronted the reception staff and they did confirm that in fact they gave our room away so they sneakily downgraded us hoping we will not realise disgraceful and disappointing to say the least to make up for it they offered to give us breakfast for one even though there were of us we got out room the next day and the free breakfast but the it put a bad spin on what was supposed to be a special birthday present also to add that the ac in both rooms was making a non stop whistling sound making it almost impossible to sleep not going back
