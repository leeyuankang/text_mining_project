no windows in the room except the one overlooks the reception that takes away privacy for i had to keep the shades shut off entirely all the time no one to help with the luggage so i had to carry them to my room finally a mistake that ruined my mood at check out the receptionist released the amount paid to the hotel that was the full amount of my residency that i have paid once i arrived to have the peace of mind spending the remaining amount in my card after doing this the remaining amount in my card was blocked and the hotel kept trying to withdraw the amount that will take more than a week to be restored i don t carry cash only cards when they have blocked my card they have caused me trouble cause i couldn t use my card neither in the airport for i was leaving to another country that day and i m still crippled because of this until today this hotel will never be my choice again
