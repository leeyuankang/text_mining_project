i have read it in previous reviews already but it was a little strange for us not to be able to open a window however we had the best sleep there as it is always dark inside the room due to the missing sunlight i felt the room itself was quite small but the bathroom huge bath tub and shower it can get noisy if people walk passed your room in heels you will need to get a tram ticket or otherwise walk mins into town every day
