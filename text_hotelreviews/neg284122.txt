bathroom privacy isn t great in any room i was shown a few some rooms just have frosted glass separating bedroom from bathroom area other rooms rely on an l shaped layout for privacy but have no doors at all awkward when sharing a room with someone the communal areas outside the room are great of passing the time while someone else is in the bathroom
