i spent the weekend sharing a room with my adult son the bathroom has glass doors and wall that gives no privacy to the person using the bathroom the doors should at least close properly so the occupant feels shut off and not worried if they can be seen heard replace the glass with a proper partition wall and door would be my suggestion my wife says she wouldn t stay there with doors and wall like that
