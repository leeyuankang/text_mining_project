i hated the fact when someone took the stairs it moved the front door so i felt that someone was coming in the room i also noticed that anyone can enter the main hotel reception and access upstairs with security the reception is most times at night unattended and you don t need a key passcode to activate the lift for a star hotel this is needed it made me feel unstable
