the hotel room feels a bit old the corridors carpets worn out the bath tiles cracked the tv reception was absolutely horrible impossible to watch anything as the picture was distorted and keeps freezing every few seconds luckily i had my laptop so i could watch movies on it the breakfast was ok but no warm choices except an egg not much around the property its mostly residential booked and paid for a room with balcony but didnt get that also it was supposed to have a cooking facilities but the room i got only had minibar which was also expensive
