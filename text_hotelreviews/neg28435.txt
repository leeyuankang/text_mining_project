i did not like that the hotel was short of staff in the evening by short i mean there was no one except one person at the reception and that was it so for everything i wanted i had to go downstairs room was very small for a family of there was no space to move in the room no place for luggage at all no tissues were provided to us in the room there were stains on the carpet the room was cleaned everytime we went out but the cleanliness went down as the day passes by we were in the hotel for days
