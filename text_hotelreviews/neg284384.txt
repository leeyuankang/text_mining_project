the staff was not knowledgeable or very accommodating for the level of hotel this was supposed to be no concierge the lines were long and only two people to take care of everyone when we checked in we were asked if we wanted to pay in us dollars or euros last time we were in europe this was not a question that was ever asked i picked usd after the staff explained the exchange rate would be dictated by my bank not exactly true the room overall was ok but small no privacy as the bathroom is basically in the bedroom for almost it does not meet expectations
