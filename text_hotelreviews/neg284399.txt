room service has a lot to improve phoned to ask for a bottle of water and was told that i could come and fetch it for myself otherwise there was a long waiting time after mins i got tiny bottle although asked for a big one after mins i called them again and finally got what i wanted took only an hour next time i just went downstairs to get a bottle of water and had to wait for mins as the staff was too busy to hand it to me at the spot in the description of the rooms the terrace room should be mentioned as the one with no view as the wall is m and blocks all the view saying that the terrace was huge and we loved it
