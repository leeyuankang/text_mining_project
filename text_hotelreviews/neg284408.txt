bit strange being asked to settle bill on arrival door entry needed new battery which required several requests to change so several times we could not get into our room staff on reception were not the most competent asked for restaurant reservations and they forgot then eventually a lovely girl whose name i can t remember did help us and recommended place was great gaudim also the bottle of complimentary cava in dsughter s room disappeared after days asked for it to be brought back but never got it overall though enjoyed our stay
