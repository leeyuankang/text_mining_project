on our first night the ac in most of the hotel was not working which was a nightmare had to sleep on the terrace for a couple of hours we addressed this with the hotel and they very fairly compensated us with a partial refund and free breakfast they also sent us fresh fruit cava and lindt chocolates all was forgiven and ac was working the next day
