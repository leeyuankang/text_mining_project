the hotel s temperature control cannot be adjusted to guests preferences we stayed at the hotel the week where barcelona s weather was relatively hot for the time of the year we tried to lower the temperature control in the room to cool it down only to find it cannot be done we called reception and they made a show to regulate the temperature control only to tell us later that the hotel s temperature was set at default and cannot be varied or adjusted we were informed that should be want to cool the room down we have to open the windows this is a first in my extensive travel experience
