the hotel is advertised as star in europe the stars are not awarded for their luxuriousness but rather for their amenities it has star amenities but is not a luxury hotel we booked a normal room and we found that the room furniture is more like what you get in a nice motel nothing wrong with it but as i said not star on the luxury scale the doors on the rooms are very thin and the halls echo so at night you can hear the other guests slamming their doors and talking in the halls and it is like they are in your room with you other than that the hotel is as advertised
