the hotel was quite dated and the family room we were given was very basic the heating in the room did not work so for nights we were literally frozen no attempt made to rectify the matter or be given an alternative room we did complain but no response as of it received from the management the hotel was very pricy for the facilities it had the lift was slow and often took the stairs as it was quicker the restaurant was very average and basic with not a great selection on offer the reception staff were friendly but not great decision makers
