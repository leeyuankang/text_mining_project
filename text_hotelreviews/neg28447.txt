the first night our shower would not get hot upon calling to complain they said they would fix it tomorrow the next day the host barged into our room after knocking with a secondary person without introducing her they then disrespectfully stood on a towel in our bathroom and left in on the floor after judging the fact that we were not out exploring at noon felt very disrespectful and unprofessional he then told me to repack my stuff and meet him downstairs so he can give us a room in a few hours it was absurd i went down to complain and finally there was some accomodation
