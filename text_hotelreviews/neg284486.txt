even though the rooms had inner doors people in the corridors were very audible we were woken up by the voices and work of the cleaning staff both mornings long before we wanted to be up we had two rooms next to each other on the second morning in the very early hours one of the rooms had a leak in the bathroom the floor was covered with water and the problem was growing a call to reception resulted in many disruptions until finally one of my friends asked if they could be moved to another room so that they could get some sleep once they were moved those of us in the other room were woken up by what seemed like the demolition of the room next door all of this before given the lack of sleep my friends requested a late checkout which was granted the hotel offered free breakfast which is usually euro per person and which we hadn t signed up for to begin with not to mention we were planning to now sleep through breakfast upon checkout i asked the manager if he thought it was appropriate to charge the full amount of the room for the night where there were so many disturbances he quoted us a discount and reminded us that we were offered free breakfast i told him i didn t think that we didn t think the room should be free for that night but surely a free egg and cup of coffee did not compensate for a lack of sleep and missing out on half a day in barcelona during our weekend away he was quite rude and his attitude towards our discussion is what left us with a negative impression of a hotel which we would otherwise recommend even with the plumbing issue it happens and a less than adequate discount for our inconvenience if we can t rely on polite good service we may as well stay at an airbnb and provide our own services
