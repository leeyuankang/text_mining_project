the front staff who i think was manager did not help us with luggage it was three adults with a year old also we had two rooms with eiffel tower view only one room was ready the other wasn t ready until pm i think their are understaffed with their cleaning crew we had to ask for compensation for one room not ready they gave us a free drink thank god we only stayed one night we were on the fourth floor with view of only half of eiffel tower by their advertisement it showed a better view of the eiffel tower which i thought i paid for there is a fifth and sixth floor which probably had a better view i did ask for a late check out for one of the rooms but was told no even though they advertise that check in is pm we did not get one of our rooms until pm so i would think we could of had late check out i would not stay there again wasn t what the pictures show of the eiffel tower
