there was a weird disturbing smell no idea what it was but it was horrible and after some days we thought that the smell was actually all over barcelona so it might not be the hotel but it was disturbing and even we were in a floor it was getting to us so we thought that it must have been the sewer system or something another minor thing is that the balcony doors were not actually closing but they were double double doors so this did not affect us at all
