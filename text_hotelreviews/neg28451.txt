the hotel seems to be better in picture in reality the room was too claustrophobic there was no staff to help us with the luggage we had to drag the heavy luggage ourselves reception was a podium with a single person with laptop attending the guests me n my daughter felt disgusting with the hospitality after such a long journey from india we recommend to go with branded hotel chains
