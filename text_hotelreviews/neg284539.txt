we paid a lot of money for a night stay and unfortunately our evening flight to batcelona was delayed so we didn t arrive at the hotel until midnight we were allocated a nice room which was modern and nicely decorated sadly at in the morning the shop refurbishment next door started and we were woken by a hammer drill drilling into the wall the hotel staff moved us to a suite on the floor which had great views but had tired decor and electrics that tripped out when we used the iron value for money was poor and i wouldn t return again
