our first room an upgrade leaked from the bathroom above obviously not a new problem from the staining we could see but the hotel was still using the room we were moved it seems the upgrade consisted of a kettle as the next room didn t have one cups teas coffee but no kettle the unhelpful man on reception said not all rooms had a kettle over a night and no kettle a kettle duly arrived poor no sound insulation between rooms we could hear normal conversation from the room next door the disco a room on the ground floor was hired for a party we were on the third floor and it was as if we were in the disco no sleep before a m attempts to contact reception went unanswered perhaps they couldn t hear the phone above the music one member of reception acted as if he was always doing us a favour too many poor points be considered a good stay other guests paying just over a night what happened to booking com s guarantee
