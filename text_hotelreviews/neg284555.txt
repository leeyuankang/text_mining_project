the staff seemed short handed we checked in early to our junior suite and was told our luggage would be brought up to us in minutes minutes later and still no luggage so we called the front desk and was told her colleague was busy so we came down and got our luggage instead the next day we asked for two more towels and they never came seemed a little ridiculous given how much we paid for the suite
