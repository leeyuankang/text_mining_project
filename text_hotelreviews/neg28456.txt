i paid extra for an eiffel tower view as it was my boyfriends birthday but the view was shocking nothing like the pictures i wanted it to be special and romantic but all we could see was the very tip of the tower not worth the extra money and i would have stayed at a different hotel had i known staff could have been a little bit friendlier as well
