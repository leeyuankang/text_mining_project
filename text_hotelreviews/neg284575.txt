really enjoyed our stay although we spent very little time at the hotel with so much to do and see we did have a lovely meal at the hotel one evening which was really good value and tasty cheaper than some of the meals we had outside great to have the pool and a g t at the outdoor bar staff were good although service not always with a smile they were efficient and very accommodating
