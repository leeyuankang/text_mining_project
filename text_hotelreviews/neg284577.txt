when booking my credit card was charged without my knowledge and then i paid again upon arrival it was only after the double payment appeared on my bill and after calling did i find out the first charge was a deposit for the card and i would have to wait business days for the refund still waiting had i known this policy i would not have booked and probably won t book again as i have to wait for my money to be returned at almost canadian a night this is ridiculous this policy should have been told to me upon my arrival
