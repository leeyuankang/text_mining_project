there was building works going on next door to the hotel so it was very noisy in one of the rooms that we booked but we were moved to another quieter and better room with a small balcony as soon as i mentioned the problem and the staff were most helpful i felt the additional cost for breakfast was high i had my three teenage children with me and because they are all over we were all charged full price i felt some leeway would have been nice especially as they don t eat a great deal
