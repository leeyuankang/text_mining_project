the is the first time that i stay in a hotel in which housekeeping did not change the sheets every day even when there had been a very noticeable makeup spill on them the wifi in our room kept going in and out we couldn t always unlock our door and it was frustrating that we complained to three other employees at the front desk with no resolution it was a bit annoying to find that because the pool was not on the top floor there were very limited hours to get sun it was mid july but the sun only reached the pool area from approximately or to about it also would have been nice to have had a free bottle of water in the room or at least a jug to a glass of water in the lobby
