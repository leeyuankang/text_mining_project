the rooms were much smaller and older than we had expected for the price and star rating we opted for a terrace room but it overlooked dirty looking roofs of the nearby buildings and yes the small hotel pool if you stuck your head over the railing to look straight down so that was disappointing and we wouldn t recommend paying extra for it
