unfortunately there was a lot of noise from the airco system and from work on the building next to the hotel the self service breakfast is very good but hygiene is poor because some of the guests touch the food with their fingers instead of using the cutlery and than put it back on the tray again as for the staff some of them are nice others are not the swimming pool was very small and it was not possible to take a swimm after breakfast because the area was still being cleaned at that time much too late i would say this hotel is very unique in a peculiar way it is the only hotel i ever encountered where the bill had to be paid at arrival instead of departure
