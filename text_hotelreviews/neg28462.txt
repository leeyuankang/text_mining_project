just a little incovient at the checking in one of the staffs said they were not ready with the room yet ask us to wait and forgot about us there for mins and it was when we were there how could they didn t have the room ready yet also it will be better if the room is bigger the size of the room is enough for two but don t feel the luxury feel like good specification standard hotel size room also we booked for tower view rooms they are right next to the metro and we have been given the first floor so there is not much view of the tower more of watching train passing through gladly the window is very good to block a lot of noise otherwise it will ruin my trip so try to avoid first floor tower view room if you can it doesn t worth the money
