check in was chaos needs massive renovation breakfast was awful and at euros extremely overpriced asked for nonsmoking room it smelled of smoke as did the mattress and as for non smoking it s more of a suggestion also if you want a safe ask for hardware at check in or you ll have to go back down to the front desk good luck with that
