air condition was not available in rooms they were too hot and uncomfortable for sleeping had to leave balcony door open at night which resulted in a draught some staff quite abrupt in particular one girl in breakfast room also charged for one breakfast on my credit card on morning of departure even though we had not eaten or booked it unfortunately i did not notice this until my return home otherwise i would have questioned it also i had treated myself to a spa treatment as there was a offer however on checking out this had not been deducted and the girl on reception said she knew nothing about this as the spa was not connected to the hotel even though it is advertised as one of their facilities i refused to make the full payment and reluctantly she contacted her manager who instructed her to give the discount the complementary drink didn t include a soft drink hubby doesnt drink only wine or beer unfortunately these things took away from an otherwise lovely trip to barcelona
