the beds were terribly bad the tv in our floor room did not work properly the toilet seat in the bathroom was broken as was the sink and the whole room was rather run down after a poorly slept first night we were given an opportunity to move to another room on the floor and got much better beds and even a little balcony and a room that had been clearly better maintained there obviously are big differences between the rooms so do give feedback
