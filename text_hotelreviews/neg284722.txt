my credit card got debited double once when i booked and once at the check out i needed multiple phone calls being asked to call back later being redirected getting no answer or people just hanging up etc finally i have been asked to write an email email address was spelt wrong at first so had to call again then email finally sent had to wait another days to finally receive an answer apparently they needed to insure that my credit card was valid and use the money as a guarantee the problem is that it will take almost a month since my stay until i get my money back
