i booked three rooms any pre paid them under my credit card and had to argue with the front desk worker as well as the manager to get the key to the third room i had to argue with them for quite a while and eventually told them that if they didn t give me the key to the room i was going to call my credit card company and tell them that i was being charged for but denied access to they came around but then one of the three rooms had a mysterious am wake up call that was not requested the next day we also had quite a bit of trouble upgrading our rooms i tried to go to the hotel bar one evening and i had to go hunt down a bar tender to get the drinks and then he left never to be seen again all things considered i would not stay here again however the catalonia las cortes in madrid same hotel brand was a completely opposite experience the room was great large and well kept and they provided free food in the afternoons in the lobby as well as great bar service in the evenings the location is great walking distance to everything you might want to see in the city center i would not stay anywhere else in madrid
