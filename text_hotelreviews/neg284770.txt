i was very disappointed that there was no tea kettle in the room on requesting one i was told that it s only for superior suite guests and as the hotel was fully booked they could not make one available to me it should be a basic facility provided in all the rooms the hotel advertises a safe in the room there is one but without the lock and key great help that is i had to request the key and was told that the hotel was full and no safe key was available yet so i had to wait till one became available one became available on the second last day of our stay after i asked again i should not have to ask for a safe key it should be a standard facility provided in every room with a code to lock the safe not a key
