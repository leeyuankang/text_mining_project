the room was a complete let down i paid a lot of money to have a room with a view of the eiffel tower as it was a very special occasion instead i got a very disappointing view of the tip of the tower it is not at all as described in the pictures in reality what you get is a very small room with a perfect view of the metro line and the supermarket across the street i definitely will not be visiting this hotel again and would never recommend it to anyone travelling to paris as it is not good value for money i still managed to have a good time in paris but the hotel almost ruined it in addition to the disappointing view they lacked basic amenities such as an iron i arrived on a friday night and there was literally no one in the bar at the hotel we planned to have a few drinks there but i think the bartender had given up as there was no one there to even serve us drinks
