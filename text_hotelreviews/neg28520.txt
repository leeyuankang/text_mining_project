the breakfast was expensive and did not offer too much to choose from so the advice is to eat outside there are plenty place around the region when we arrived at which was one hour past the check in time our room was not yet ready we had to wait and the front desk person did not even explained initially why we had to wait and after minutes we asked what was taking so long and he in a very rude manner told us to be patient the room did not had an information brochure e g if you need to call to the front desk you need to magically guess that you need to dial i also needed to use an iron which i had to go downstairs to get it because there was no way to know how to call front desk and the receptionist asked me to bring it back after i was done very informal hostel kind of approach so those little perks you expect to get when you go to a star hotel you will not get it from this one
