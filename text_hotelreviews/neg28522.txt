i booked rooms for effel tower view but when i arrive hotel with my family hotel staff told that they do not have eiffel tower view room i felt very bad when i asked hotel what is the purpose of booking in advance they replied that this is my choice now if i want i can go to another hotel i was very angry as i visited time in france anyway i manage but when i paid the bill they charge the full amount of the room they should charge less as it was given the room without any view when i asked them to give discount as you have not given the room of my choice hotel staff told me that you write a e mail then they will think to return some amount this is really very bad
