when we arrived we had to bring our own baggage in and take it to our rooms via the lift that was still being finished and had wires hanging out and loose tiles in the floor no explanation was given for this there is no fridge in the room and consumables weren t restocked each day when i went to book an additional night purely to avoid the hassle of moving our luggage i was quoted a price i could get cheaper on booking com many times i told the staff that it was my wife s birthday including when booking but nothing was done to make the stay special for her at all pretty disappointed especially for the price
