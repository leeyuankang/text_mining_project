the hotel is classed as a four star but has no facilities to speak of we arrived at about and wanted a drink but were told the bar was not in use the restaurant did service breakfast but that was it if you wanted lunch of evening meal you had to go out luckily it s in a vicinity that has lots of restaurants our bedroom was advertised as having a view of the court yard but all we had was a blank wall facing us
