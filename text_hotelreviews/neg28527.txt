we arrived at the hotel on a sunday and found that our names were not on the arrival list at the lobby unbeknownst to us we had through our own fault made a booking for the wrong day monday instead of sunday instead of working with us to try to figure out what was going on the man at the lobby immediately told us in the most unpleasant manner that he didn t have our booking after ignoring our repeated requests for the wifi password so we could look up our booking confirmation email he instructed me very patronisingly to calm down informed us repeatedly that we were wrong and proceeded to give us a condescending lesson in etiquette though we were at no time rude and only confused and understandably alarmed at the thought of possibly not having a reservation in the end a room was available and told us we could have it for which we were grateful though he did it in the most unpleasant combative manner the lift to our room was malfunctioning so we had to lug our luggages up two floors of steps without any offer at all of assistance our room when we got to it was well appointed with a lovely view but had a strange and mouldy smell a pretty hotel but the welcome we had gotten just left a vile aftertaste
