the last day i was there i had to checkout and come back in the afternoon for freshing up before i go to the airport they told me they had a bathroom in the lobby floor the i could use for that purpose when i came back in the afternoon i found out that this bathroom was just a small toilet booth was very smelly in there and very clustrofobic with a sink next to it which faces the bar needless to say it was very uncomfortable and left me with a bad taste maybe it s just me but i really expected more i felt dirty all the way home after that
