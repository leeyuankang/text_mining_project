the room was awful designed by a man for a man probably no dressing table or anywhere to sit and put on makeup as you have to stand to attention in the bathroom and there is no shelf over the sink you have to keep bending down to pick up things from the little unit underneath the sink the spare loo roll holder is in the doorway of the shower the toilet has a little platform halfway down it which catches everything double gross there is no sanitary provision ladies just a gross open bin underneath a light there is a glass topped table in the bedroom with a lethal sharp corner in the dark the kettle flex is too short you have to unplug it to use which means bending low beneath the table and banging your head on the pendant light fitting each time you stand up you can t avoid it
