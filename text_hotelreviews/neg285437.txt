the room is not well isolated and everything was very loud you could hear the metro passing in the underground and all neighbours moving the room located in the floor and at the street corner did make the stay very uncomfortable as you could hear everything on the street like being next to the people on the nearby terrace very uncomfortable bathroom as you could not realise how much it could be seen from outside the room was superior only by the dimension otherwise a room to raise it to a standard some investments should be made by far too expensive for it s offering apart location
