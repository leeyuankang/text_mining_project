everything else the room was not ready by check in and i had been sitting there waiting other hotels would make sure your room was done before guests who hadn t even shown up yet the room was super tiny and the one small window opened into a shaft it was claustrophobic no star hotel i have ever been in has ever been so small and uncomfortable the pillows were flat and the walking space was so small the gym and pool were blocks away and for a pretty high fee while the location is fantastic i m sure there must be better places to stay in that area
