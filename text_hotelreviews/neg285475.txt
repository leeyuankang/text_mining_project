hard pressed to find negatives about hotel regina i suppose it would be nice to include breakfast in the rate although there is a place across the street that serves a reasonable priced breakfast plus there are cafes half a block from the hotel this is minor but i would rather have less drinks stocked in the room fridge at high prices and allow more room in the fridge for the guest to store water or other foods we may purchase at the boqueria market or other nearby stores that is just my opinion others may like having beverages and snacks available for purchase in the room the above were minor issues highly recommend hotel regina and would stay again
