i paid for a stars hotel the hotel deserves stars maximum here s what i saw there old building old and slow elevator the shower has a small head but was okay bathroom was poor air conditioning was very difficult to adjust when you walk on the floor it makes noise they didn t provide tissues and toilet papers unless we ask for it free water just for the first day small mini bottles should be for all the days the reception i called them around times they picked up twice when i complained about the issues i m facing the front desk manager rude and not even wearing a name badge told me if you don t like our hotel you can leave it and you shouldn t compare it to hotels in europe someone remind me where is spain he didn t even try to satisfy me way too too expensive poor value for money i don t recommend this hotel
