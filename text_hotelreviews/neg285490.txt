i asked for a place to eat where the locals would enjoy the hotel recommended a place called trocaderos about minute walk away food was terrible must be a partner of the hotel because they gave us a voucher for a free cava don t trust their advice look on yelp prior to going breakfast was per person and with a family of four would have totaled for breakfast pretty pricey starbucks and cafes and la boqueria really close by so we didn t waste our money on the hotel food the window on our room went directly to an outside access for maintenance this didn t really make me feel secure because you could literally walk out the window and go to other room windows and break in etc won t be back
