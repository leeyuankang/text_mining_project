the room had no soundproofing could hear everything from other rooms embarrassing when you have you kids with you we booked for two adults and two kids however there was only two glasses for water essentially two of everything no consideration for more occupants two lifts and one was antique no atmosphere in hotel bar lounge no music not even background the parking is an external car park however linked to hotel for payment and despite asking multiple times how to get into it early in the morning they would not come and show us we ended up walking down the ramp with suitcases and kids in pouring rain very disappointing stay
