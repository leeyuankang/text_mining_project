i have registered to nights although i knew i will need only this is due to our flight that was late and i didn t wanted running the risk to conduct the checkout early at the last day problem is that i paid by mistake for the breakfast for two for the day and they didn t agreed to cancel nor to give any discount or even to give us some voucher for next time and for that i will not arrive again as for the hotel facilities the rooms are very old fashion and this is different than reflected in the hotel s website the hotel location is excellent but the hotel is expensive only due to that
