not really a four star hotel i had a superior room clean but stark not very welcoming for a four night stay no touches you expect from a four star superior property it s really a decent three star rickety lift very noisy during day from building work i was in barcelona working at an expo and had a half day to explore popped back to hotel and it was constant hammering ive read since there s a spa really wasn t told about it no info at all in room so didn t know very mean with one v small bottle of water on first day
