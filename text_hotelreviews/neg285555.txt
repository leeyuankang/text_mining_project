there was some building work in the hotel which started early in the morning which was slightly annoying obviously this will be time limited the hallways could do with new carpets and a lick of paint i thought it was a little expensive for a basic double room for nights per night midweek in october with out breakfast included there are plenty places nearby though to eat both better and cheaper would i stay again probably not mainly because there are better options nearby for the same money
