checking in was a nightmare forced to wait after a long exhausting journey for two extra hours in the lobby to get the room i booked a month earlier still didn t get what i exactly booked at the end desk staff made me feel that they are doing me a favour getting the room i purchased ready despite the additional waiting time also when i booked online using booking com the site said good breakfast nothing of the sort just basic and very limited cold breakfast that costs around euros per person i must mention here though that the hotel has a very nice breakfast area
