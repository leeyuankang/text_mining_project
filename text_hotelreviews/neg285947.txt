the rooms are small we walked into our room to find a cockroach running around the staff moved us to a better room one with a balcony the lift was broken also so it took ages to wait for the other lift the outside garden was out of action as they were doing work so some facilities were not on hand we loved our trip very much but slightly concerned about cockroach if wanted to come back but for the price it was not on point enough
