staff was nice and spoke good english but it was clear they were not well trained and did not know the hotel policies three incidents with the front desk first when we arrived over easter weekend we asked if there were any parades going on and when they didn t know they proceeded to make us wait for minutes while they literally googled the answer in front of us if you don t know something just say it i can google things for myself second we were told that the roof top terrace closes at which is kind of silly since dinner in spain starts around or the front desk informed us that while the terrace bar closes at we could order drinks at the normal hotel bar open at reasonable hours and bring it up to the terrace a day this of course is not true and it took some back and forth with the bartender and the front desk person to clear it up third we were told our breakfast was included with our stay we ate breakfast of the days it was decent and there was never anyone keeping track of room numbers or any way to get a paper bill the third day as we were checking out we mentioned we d be getting breakfast and the person at the front desk informed us he was going to charge us euro for it i told him that when we checked in they said breakfast was included in the stay and we had been eating there with no problems the other two days and all he said was he wouldn t charge us for the other two days what a nice guy the final thing to fix is that we got a paper of all the hotel amenities and in black white it says gym with indoor pool i m not sure how this gets lost in translation but there is no pool and we got looked at like idiots for asking where the pool was all that being said the accommodations in the hotel were fine but my note to management would be to get all your front desk staff on the same page
