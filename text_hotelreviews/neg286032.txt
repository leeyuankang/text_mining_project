we loved everything just a little tip to guests who intend to rent the bikes the ones at the hotel don t come with a lock a very kind receptionist employee however informed us that we can reserve bikes with them via a local bike shop which gives you a discount so we paid per person for hours of exploring the city on bikes with locks
