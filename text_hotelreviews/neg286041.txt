the staff were unhelpful terse slow unprofessional i experienced sleepless nights with failing air con and loud noises at all hours through paper thing walls a waitress blowing her nose in the kitchen at breakfast three times with the final insult wiping it with her hand i had an argument with the assistant manager about my disappointment in the lack of communication from his staff in making a reservation at a restaurant if you can t do it just tell us and we ll make alternate arrangements this went on for three days he stood over me at the front desk saying he thought it was fair that they have changed their advice four times regarding whether we had the booking or not i m not confrontational but he was out of line and beyond unhelpful if you like being looked after when you re in a five star hotel beware
