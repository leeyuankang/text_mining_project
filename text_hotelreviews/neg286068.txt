price was high over us per night however this may be the norm for barcelona and central location of this hotel and room was very nice double bed was two twins pushed together they did not have an electrical converter in the room and wanted to charge us to buy one but after i said that should be included with room for the price we were paying they provided two converters at no extra charge
