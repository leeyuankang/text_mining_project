the staff could be a little less cold i feel while this certainly does not apply to everyone there are a select number of staff members at the reception and the bar who were not rude but not quite nice either speaking in an almost sarcastic manner when addressing guests perhaps it was because of the season or lack of guests but the roof terrace is not open except for weekends
