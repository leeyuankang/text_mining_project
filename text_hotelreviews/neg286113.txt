there are quite a few points don t take a room in the floor coz at least in our case their laundry man drops the washed laundry in the middle of the night and he cannot do it quietly unless you are someone who s out partying till late you can be expected to be woken up in the middle of the night call the front desk and their response is i apologize for the inconvenience sir but the man has to do his job you ask for a laundry bag to pack your soiled clothes separately and the response you could get is i have quite a lot of bags in the lobby please carry what you need to pack with you i can provide you with the bag seriously you expect the customer to walk down with their soiled clothes the rooms are quite small and the electrical fixtures are flimsy we explicitly asked for a room with a double bed and we were given a room with two single beds not sure which part of my request was not clear to these guys when we asked for an alternate room we were shown one in a corner where if you turn you ll be facing the wall
