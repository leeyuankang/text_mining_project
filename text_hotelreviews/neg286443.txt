the room had a very strange smell heating did not work so it was very cold staff were very unfriendly so we were not too keen on asking them for their help breakfast was disappointing too many cakes and sweet stuff were served eggs were cold not very much choice for vegetarians and vegans for this price i expected much more for breakfast and more assistance from the staff
