extremely disappointed and annoyed about the car parking as this was one of the main reasons i booked with the hotel as it stated it provided car parking however this was not the case and i had to park out on the street which resulted in our hire car being towed away as it was parked illegally this resulted in a euro additional cost and immense upset caused to the family at the start of the holiday very poor communication by hotel regarding car parking
