i booked a double bed and got twin beds on arrival when i asked to change they said that since we arrived late they gave all double beds to other guests they should really only sell double rooms until they run out and then offer only the twins they have left also there were no tea coffee facilities on the room very expensive breakfast and parking at euro each luckily there is a nice cafe to get breakfast nearby and free parking readily available across the street
