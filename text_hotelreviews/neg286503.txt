poor attitude of staff was very disappointing they were very unhelpful when they made a mistake with our parties booking and we found someone else in our room at first they refused to give us a different room as they said they were fully booked after complaining to the hotel manager and the company we booked with they miraculously found a room available for us it s a nice place to stay but i wouldn t say it s star at best
