there was a high pitched noise when others on my floor or around my room where showering and at first i thought this was a sound coming from my own room or my ac it took me going out into the hall to realise it was permeating the entire area of my floor probably not much can be done but when it only lasted for the duration of others showers so it wasn t a problem
