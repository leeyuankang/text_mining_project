we booked a twin room this was on the first floor to the street it was very noisy so we decided to ask for a quieter room we got on in the backyard as we saw it we aksed if it was smaller as the other room which it was but the employee told us no it isn t and talked on after he left and we got our luggage to the room we firstly heard the ventilators of the air condition units which were directly in front of our room the night was horrible and i think this room is a standby room or something like this because the towels were dirty and also the shower and there was dust everywhere we didn t understand why we got this room as we asked for a more quiet room so we asked the next day for an other room and we got help from martin and also an upgrade thanks for that
