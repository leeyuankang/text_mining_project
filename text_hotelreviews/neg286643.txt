i was very disappointed with this hotel i booked nights prepaid with booking com the first night the wifi didn t work in my room and i couldn t do any of my work when i said it to the staff at reception she nearly laughed at me and told me every room has wifi the next day i told the receptionist again and i was moved to a room with no air con when i said it to reception they moved me again to a room that was extremely noisy and had a green light on the ceiling it looked like a smoke alarm but wasn t i honestly had the worst night sleep another thing i noticed in the two nights i stayed in the kingsley they only had one person on reception at all times
