i had a kingsize room but it was still quite basic no hair conditioner provided instant coffee only no minibar only tiny water glasses the bathroom was cold and no heated towel rail or it didn t work the reception staff were slow to check in out seemed more interested in chatting in the back office it s also hard for taxis to stop at the front of the hotel and there is no doorman to help this was my second stay i don t think i will use again it wasn t cheap and you can get more luxury for the same price in a boutique hotel or apartment
