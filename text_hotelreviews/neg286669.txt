the room booked was described as a deluxe room in fact the room was very small and the air conditioning did not work as the weather was very hot when we were there very lucky weather wise the problem with the a c was a big problem and made for a very uncomfortable night with little sleep we were moved the next day twice and were in the end given an executive room and a breakfast all stressful whilst only there for two nights whilst the hotel manager was very helpful in trying to rectify our concerns re the a c i feel that these rooms should not be classed as deluxe as on being asked to see a standard room we were informed that the hotel does not have standard rooms surely for a room to be classed as deluxe there must be a basic standard room for the client to gauge whether the cost of a deluxe room is a better option we have only given the very low rating on facilities because of the misrepresentation that we feel is being given regarding the label of deluxe
