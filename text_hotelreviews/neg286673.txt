a bit awkward to get to the front door from the footpath i had to hoist a heavy suitcase up a short flight of steps would be handy if there was a ramp along one side to wheel your suitcase up would also allow wheelchair access laundry facilities turned out to be a send out service with a hour turnaround ok but rather expensive however there are dry cleaning laundry outlets available on the street in the neighbourhood which are much cheaper
