i stayed in room and whilst this is a lovely room they forget to tell you when booking in that you are unlikely to get a good nights sleep right outside the window by the bed is a noise that sounds very similar to a helicopter hovering outside your room all night i rang the duty manager after when i realised this noise wasn t going to stop i complained this morning on checking out and was told as soon as the general manager natasha ludlow came on duty that they would get her to ring me i returned to the north of england and rang the hotel again at as i had not had a call i was once more promised a call as soon as natasha came out of her meeting it is now and it must be a long meeting as i am still awaiting my call i do not expect to pay in excess of for a room i cannot sleep in no matter how nice it is
