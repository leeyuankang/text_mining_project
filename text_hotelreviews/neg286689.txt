our room in particular had no views whatsoever from three separate windows this wasn t too big a problem though because it s a hotel and we were only really there in the evening all of the windows pointed in towards the building into the vents and piping etc they also hummed a fair bit but wasn t too noticeable at night so this wasn t a problem it was a very nice hotel and was a real treat however it was also very expensive and in hindsight it probably would have been more sensible to stay at somewhere cheaper as we were only using it as a place to rest our heads
