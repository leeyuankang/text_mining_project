i was told the hotel has a business relationship with a local gym so that guests can use it on a day pass basis with discount however when i went to the gym they said they had never had such a relationship and this was confirmed by a call from the gym manager the following day to the hotel this was a shame since such a facility would be a massive bonus when staying in london for an intense week it was also a bit embarrassing to turn up at the gym and then to be turned away
