poor value for money last time we stayed breakfast was included in the price and rooms were great but the room we got this time has never been a deluxe room the room was very small even though i had asked for a twin room the zip bed although unzipped had to still be pushed together the room was freezing due mainly to drafty windows my bedside lamp was flashing and making buzzing noises which was scary as it was wired into bed head and even after reporting it it wasn t fixed the bathroom was cold the towel rail was so close to the door that if you had towels on it the door wouldn t close and even though the room was cold the towel rail was red hot and this worried me as i am diabetic and was scared of catching my arm on it on the way to the loo in the night the furniture was in poor state too the staff were unhelpful and the concierge left me and my daughter to struggle with our bags when leaving definitely not worth the money
