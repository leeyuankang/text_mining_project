i have stayed in many hotels all over the world and have never had a hotel with staff so disinterested in the customer we did not once have a smiling welcoming staff member from start to finish no idea about location of theatre even though it was marketed as one and you felt like you were a nusisence if you asked for information the hotel is lovely but they do need to invest in training as the staff lack basic customer service skills
