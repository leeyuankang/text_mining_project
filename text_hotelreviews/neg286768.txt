room very small had requested prior to arrival that extra sheets be placed under the duvets not there on arrival informed reception who promised they would be put on beds whilst we were out but still not there when we returned asked at reception again and then had two different people bring sheets then had to make up the beds ourselves better communication between department would have prevented this inconvenience also a ridiculous arrangement for buying breakfast which incidentally we d experience on two previous visits on first morning were told we had to purchase vouchers for each at reception were told by restaurant staff that if we paid in the restaurant the price would be next morning we were told they had no more vouchers and had changed the system so that we had to sign for breakfast in the restaurant which we duly did the cost not most confusing hopefully they have changed the system so that you simply sign for breakfast of course what would be even better would be to include breakfast in the room rate it is quite expensive
