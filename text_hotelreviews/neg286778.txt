we were not that bothered that our deluxe room with extra space could hardly have had any less but had noticed that one of the two hotel lifts was out of order on our arrival we had lots of luggage but despite this were allocated a room on the floor and located through numerous corridors with double doors to open and a very lengthy walk from and to the remaining lift we were offered no help the second lift then also failed that afternoon but the hotel assured us an engineer was on the way and this would be repaired that night though as a precaution we were promised though only after we asked for this help with our luggage if the lifts were still not working in time for our early morning departure our taxi having been booked by the hotel both were still out of order the next morning but after no help arrived in time for the taxi we eventually took our own cases and bags down floors where we were greeted by a smiling receptionist asking if we had enjoyed our stay
