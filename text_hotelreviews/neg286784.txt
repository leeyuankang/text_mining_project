i have been to this hotel for many years and during the last two visits i have not been impressed with the menu in the restaurant which is the same as the room service menu quite limited not all of the items were available on the menu and on both occasions there was no merlot available visits a few weeks apart was given a knickerbocker glory which i had waited half an hour for and it was just cream out of a can and a tiny bit of fruit and ice cream in the bottom i suppose i am comparing it with how it was a few years ago where the food was better and different from the room service menu
