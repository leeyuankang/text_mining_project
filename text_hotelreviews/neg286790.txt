the hotel bar was tricky on the evening we visited i think that it was a combination of everyone descending upon the bar at once their only being two staff available a breakage happening the card machine not working at the bar and one customer who decided to be very difficult she was just being difficult and from what i could see had little cause to complain this in no way spoiled our stay it was just unfortunate
