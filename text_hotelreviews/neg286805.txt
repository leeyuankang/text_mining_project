i booked and paid for a deluxe twin not sure that s what i got room was very cramped and quite claustrophobic there was only one chair for a twin room not sure why you think it is ok to push two twin beds together twin beds should be separated view of a dirty roof with a skylight which seemed about foot away from our window the bathroom window was painted shut and appeared to have quite a lot of bird poo running down it it sounded as if water was running in the middle of the night but realised it was the air con no bedside drawers and the only other two drawers in the room had a hairdryer in it and bible and phone book when i opened the last door leading to our room from the corridoor a blast of heat hit you are these rooms above the kitchen definitely feel as if i ve been ripped off bar staff seem to like playing hide and seek
