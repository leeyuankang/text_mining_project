the room was very small nothing like pictured on the website there was an issue paying for the room when we arrived but this was soon rectified but at night after ordering room service were told we had to come down to pay for it completly goes against the whole point of room service we were then stopped by the night manager who asked for another means of payment for the room i told him we had paid but he said it had declined i explained he was mistaken the funds had left my account said it was a little late that it was not the time to be sorting this out that we would look into it in the morning he then pestered us until asking for another means of payment knocking on our door constantly calling our room phone which we had to disconnect totally unacceptable i have never been treated like this in any other hotel as it happened the payment had been authorised all they had to do was accept it in any other hotel i ve stayed in you settle your bill on checkout that includes any room service his constant pestering made us feel like they thought we were trying to get away without paying it ruined our stay
