we checked in about and went for dinner when we returned to our room and i went to close the curtains i discovered that although the sash window was closed it was not locked although we were on the first floor there was a flat roof outside our window from which our room was accessible i felt very exposed that i had left our room open especially as i was travelling alone with my son one would not normally check windows when they are closed and the outside temp is i felt this was very negligent of the housekeeping staff
