room was much smaller than expected bathtub was dangerously high and very slippery grab bar was not located where one can hold on to it to get in and out of bathtub hotel entrance was located directly in front of bus stop that always had a string of buses lined up so cab couldn t pull up to hotel to unload our luggage
