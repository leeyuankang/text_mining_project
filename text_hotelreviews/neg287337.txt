not a four star hotel room was very basic with old furniture bed was rather basic and not comfortable bed linen was basic and it didn t feel well to sleep in non smoking hotel but there was strong smoke odor in our room overall experience is that the hotel feels like a two star motel significant renovation is needed to qualify for a four star level
