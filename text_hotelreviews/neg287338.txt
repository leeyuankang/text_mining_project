first impression very unpleasant chat with lady receptionist felt really not welcomed quite old fashioned interior design too much of red colour and buffet reminding soviet style very poor wifi no iron at rooms and possibility to ask rent and bring it to your room the only option is to ask at reception to bring it to the hotel buffet downstairs and iron yourself their what to do in in the morning if you want to iron in a hurry to do it between tables with people having lunch weird air conditioner was working too loud hotel stuff forgot to supplement free bottle of drinking water few days but haven t forgot to charge for small bottle of water from minibar you should give it for present because i bought it just because of your lack of attention and free water supplement missed there is at least min walk to the closest metro station and with luggage hurrying to the airport you should keep it in mind we wanted to buy some wine in the hotel bar but bartender suggested only a glass of drink because she should go to the cellar for the bottle what don t you want to serve your clients better and sell more i asked to make coffee in larger cup in the hotel bar to take away it to my room more safely but got a refusal by bartender no these cups are for only for tea expensive breakfast in old fashioned buffet for euros and even less you can get superb breakfast in french cafe with teracce and view to votive church close to the hotel
