the pillows were flat there was no air conditioning and the room was very hot the air conditioning apparently does not get turned on until summer despite the weekend being the hottest weekend in vienna so far this year i booked this hotel based on the fact that it advertised having air conditioning the breakfast was very poor not very much choice no bread available even though we went to breakfast hours before it was finished not great at all
