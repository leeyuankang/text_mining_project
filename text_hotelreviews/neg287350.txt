there were some hidden charges it seems the lady when i checked in was a bit confused she said breakfast was included but then i got a bill so i guess not i came a few days before meeting up with a tour group a friend was staying with me until the group arrived at which time i would be assigned a room mate from the group i explained this when i checked in but the lady at the desk was visibly upset at this this obvious by her loud typing on the keyboard i then double checked the day the tour group was arriving to make sure it was all set and the lady that day was very nice and did not indicate any issues the shower presented some issues going from blazing hot to freezing cold and it was difficult to find anything in the middle
