staff was generally very unfriendly and miserable at reception with exception of consierge which was kind even tho i asked for an early check in weeks in advance the room was given to me at the size is so small decor dated and not fresh and room are facing a little street full of rubbish bins products in the room were never refilled no espresso machine no complementary bottle of water in the room when i asked for it they said it was only for best costumer no spa i just think when you pay this amount for a room you should receive a service that matches your expectation
