the hotel feels very high end but signs of wear are everywhere in the public spaces worn carpets stains brass polish chipped or worn off completely in the elevator the rooms are in great shape though we stayed here twice over the weekend a friday night paid for by a client then sunday night on our own dime the friday night room was a suite but the experience was checkered the internet which is costly worked only minutes at a time before requiring a modem restart to work again i only learned this trick and where the modem was hidden in the room from the concierge who came up to investigate the first time i called down after quickly getting tired of re booting times an hour they sent maintenance to have a look of course when he arrived it was working and he said to call the next time it went off so he could send my exact ip address to the server in greece to lock me onto the network but i was leaving for an event so couldn t wait around for it to kick me off again i would have much preferred just a replacement modem to solve the problem or some similar resolution but ended up dealing with it for the hours we were there then at we could clearly hear the neighbors awake and having a lively conversation through the wall we eventually called down to the front desk to ask them to politely quiet them down but nothing came of it and by we were up anyways but why the soundproofing was so non existent is a bigger question
