i feel it s a shame that we still have to pay for wifi in this day and age more so considering the class of this hotel the coverage is good and fast w ee so avoid paying extra money for a slow and insecure wifi connection if you can avoid it breakfast is way too expensive walk minutes east and you ll find many decent places for breakfast for a reasonable price
