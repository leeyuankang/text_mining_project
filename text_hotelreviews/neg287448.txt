i didn t like the way they dealt with my wife and kids i have booked two rooms for all of us via booking com however the second room was booked for me when i arrive later after them any way when they arrived the refused that one adult my wife and kids can stay in one room my wife told that we have booked second room but later when i arrive any way i can understand there point and enforcement of having the second room but what i don t like the rate they give her almost double what we had form booking pounds per night for one room and the room was tiny small with a very noisy sound of ac like a turbine really found this very bad as my wife was alone and arrived late and tired and they enforce her to take the room for this high price although i m staying with them almost nights one room nights the second room
