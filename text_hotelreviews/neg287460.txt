alyn williams very enjoyable excellent staff and food presentation a fine dining experience but chat with chef and ask him if he would have eaten the mutton undercooked too that i was served pretending to be lamb it reminded me of school dinners fatty gristly and completely unacceptable for any restaurant let alone a starred one
