small room although called a superior room shower was below standard and needed replacing nowhere to hang bathrobe tv all too complicated didn t need a whole keyboard just a remote thin walls could hear exactly what was happening in next room which made me uncomfortable rather aggressive receptionist on check in no instructions on room safe it was not as other hotel safes very poor internet at very high charge in room tea or coffee facilities would have been nice as i do not sleep well and a warm drink usually helps but i was not about to call room service for a cup of warm water
