we found this hotel substandard in most respects the superior king room was not superior quite the reverse the room service was disappointing the charges for many items were excessive especially on the breakfast menu we found this hotel very disappointing and inadequate in all respects especially the manager s response to our email of complaint which was dismissive and not worthy of what used to be a good hotel an apology would have sufficed someone in senior management needs to take note of what many people are reporting about this hotel in our opinion in no way should it carry a star quality rating in no way will we be back
