having stayed at this property many times it is astonishing that not once have i found a friendly affable member of staff surly doormen self important front desk clerks and generally very unfriendly it is obvious they are used to dealing with a certain type of clientele and their attitude is arrogant and unhelpful there are plenty of hotels to opt for and we are grateful not to be obliged to stay at westbury
