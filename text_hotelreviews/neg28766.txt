for the price we were not impressed upon arrival minutes beyond check in the room was not ready we had somewhere to be so i explained we couldn t wait at which point a different room was found it had a bit of a cigarette smoke smell to it and the bed was very uncomfortable we aren t usually ones to leave bad reviews but other than the location i could not see how the price was justified
