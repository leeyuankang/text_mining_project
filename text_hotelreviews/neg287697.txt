we had a room for people which was one of the smallest rooms we had ever been given at a hotel the area for the double bed was very small and our son slept in a small area behind the tv the view was over a small road but you couldn t see it as the doors would not fully open i think this was for security health and safety reasons the price of this hotel was far too much money for what you get this is the first time i have ever said this in all my years of travelling it did t ruin our trip to barcelona but when i return i will definitely do a bit more research on the hotel
