there was no iron which was desperately needed the bathroom is in the middle of the room with a frosted glass door that does not lock leaving little privacy in a room of six people there are two buildings and the apartment was in the back building which is not handicap accessible there are many stairs to climb from the lobby through the courtyard to the back building where there is an elevator the building where the lobby is does have an elevator transportation cannot drive all the way to the hotel you must walk a short distance with your luggage to get to from the hotel but worth it
