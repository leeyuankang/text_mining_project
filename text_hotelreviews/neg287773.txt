the staff front desk martin breakfast and the airconditioning in the rooms booked rooms for nights with breakfast for our family and we booked this room upon the recommendation of our relatives and also based on the reviews from the internet when we arrived at the hotel the front desk officer girl told us that it s not possible that the kids will stay in our room since it s indicated in the booking only adults adults per room i told them this is not the first time travelling with the kids and we normally just get room for twin rooms since they are still small we told them just charge us for the stay of the kids and we will have no problem we can just stay in room they said they will make an exemption on this case provided that the kids will pay euros for the breakfast for the whole duration of our stay the following day breakfast time this martin who claimed to be the manager went up to us in the middle of the buffet area and asked why are there kids when there should only be adults i explained to him and informed him to just talk to the people who did the check in but despite all my explanations he didnt believe us he made it appear that as if we were hiding the kids from the hotel he even ordered us to be back in the hotel by before his duty ends and to bring the passports of the children even when i already told him we will be on a montserrat tour and dont know what time we will be back to make the long story short and as the story drama progressed i found out this martin was well informed by his colleague and was informed that they made an exemption already and yet he still went his way just to humiliate us never felt so discriminated my question why did he still come up to us when he knew already that there was an exemption in our case that there was already an arrangement prior to him that the kids will pay breakfast
