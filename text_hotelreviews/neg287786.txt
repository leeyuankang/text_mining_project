after being up since am in the morning we were not too pleased that our room still wasn t ready by reception staff were apologetic but we had to wait a further very tired minutes to get in it might be an age thing but we do like a coffee or tea whilst in our hotel rooms there are no drink making facilities at all which i thought came as standard even in b b s we went out and bought a kettle mugs and drinks etc only to find on our last day there is actually a sign in the lift saying to ask for a kettle if u want one doh lol maybe just put one in the room to start with a few scuffs on the floor but other than those few minor details everything muy buena grazias x
