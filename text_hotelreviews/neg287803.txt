i met the worst reception guy ever his name is mark which prove that sometimes one single silly detail can ruin a hole experience he was really rude and impolite and out of professionalism he asked me to sign another reset when i arrived which is not a normal and my answer was that you already withdraw your money he said to approve that you arrived which doesn t make since because i signed the form of registration and finally i signed because he enforced me by shouting in front of other clients that i have no choice either i sign or i wont have the room although i gave him the option of return my money and i can leave on the other side they are having a problem with their electronic cards of the doors and he kept giving me a rude answers by saying maybe you dont know how to use it while i knew from the bill man that he is giving help times everyday to other clients for the same problem and the manager was really polite and decent and she gave a free breakfast in the end but her answer for my complain was she missed the situation which really not professional but to be honest the other staff were really good and helpful and friendly the issue is you can put your policy and i need to have the option to accept or refuse and finally the way you deal with your clients specially in hospitality
