rooms are a bit small but i it is hard to find larger rooms in the la rambla area the pricing was a bit too much but it was on the new year s eve so it explains it we got single beds that were close to each other but the mattresses were larger than the beds so they often slip aside the cable tv worked only minutes each minutes there was a problem with it the overall look is good but if you look close at the details you will see that it needs some reparations like the ceiling in the bathroom also the bathroom doors have a cm gap on each side basically you could see and hear everything in the bathroom not very pleasant
