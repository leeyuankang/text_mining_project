cab ride from airport on the way there was about euros i think we got ripped off because on the way back it was only euros but honestly you can take the train to the hotel from the airport the website said ipads in room but it turned out you have to get them from the lobby but it s come serve same with bikes make sure to get up early wifi would cut out around at night also staff would recommend some places to eat but did quick google review and they weren t that good but i guess they were getting a kickback from those places since they gave you a card to show the resturant to get a small discount for the sagrada familia church book early online to save money but make sure it s an official website the hotel staff said a different one didn t really trust it just took a can there and they said no that s not official and pointed to a huge banner outside the church with the correct website
