the staff were unhelpful and border line rude towards us the room was a bit of a let down the hotel in general was quite loud with many kids running up and down the hall and banging on doors late at night my overall experience was not four star and wouldn t recommend a stay here there are plenty of hotels on las ramblas try there first
