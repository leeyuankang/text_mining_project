we complained twice about the shower flooding the bathroom but this was not addressed the bathroom door was frosted glass and it did not close by so we had to use a chair inside the bathroom to wedge it shut our room overlooked an alleyway and was very noisy throughout the night the breakfast was expensive at euro a head so we walked paces across the alleyway to a cafe which was exceptionally clean serving excellent breakfasts the hotel bar was expensive and empty most nights so there was no atmosphere
