the rooms are small and lack some maintenance you would not expect this in a star hotel there were holes in the bathroom wall for fixation of the towel support in a previous position the shower was leaking in a corner and did not have a closing door so whenever we took a shower the whole floor was wet i told the manager and he said he will send someone to repair but he didn t the lamp in the room and it is not well fixed to the ceiling the room they propose as a family room is very small for people i am sorry to write this because i liked the hotel overall and the position is perfect i would still recommend it
