the room wasn t cleaned when we were out all day so we came back to an unmade bed and wet towels on the floor and dirty mugs and no fresh teabags we were offered a different room as there was nobody available to clean the room at we packed up and moved to a new room and then took a shower only to discover the shower was faulty and the water wouldn t drain away so we had a flooded bathroom floor with water pouring out into the room carpet not good we found the staff in the bar to be not particularly friendly or helpful no cocktails were available very strange for a hotel in central london
