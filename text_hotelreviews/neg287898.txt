only one negative remark and a qualified or conditional observation because it may have been an isolated and exceptional occurrence rather than a frequent repeated event during the entire night of thursday from approximately noise and loud voices emanating from the garden and the terrasse surrounding the garden continually disturbed my sleep i believe the noise came from hotel personnel washing and cleaning the terrasse and garden area i looked out of the window several times to identify the source of the noise and observed several people moving about on the terrasses however i cannot affirm with certainty that they were in fact the source or cause of the noise i choose to sleep with the windows open in preference to using air conditioning consequently i hear noise more easily frankly although the noise disturbed my peace rest this is not a major short coming of my stay at the petit palace yes somewhat inconvenient but certainly forgiveable
