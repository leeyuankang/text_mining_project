i asked for an iron and it took days till we recieved it there are rooms with balcony outside and weird people are stairing all the time on your balcony from the neighbour buildings at night the entry is full of homeless people with a lot of dogs and sometimes the hotel entry is blocked i told the staff but they answered outside hotel we cant do anything breakfast is star max this hotel is overrated and doesnt deserve stars as well the price is so high as u can get cheaper with better location
