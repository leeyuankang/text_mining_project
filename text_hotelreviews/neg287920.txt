it would be great if some of the breakfast items could be labelled there was no mirror in the main bedroom only in the bathroom which made things a bit inconvenient the bunk bed ladder was unstable and it made it difficult to get on and off it would be a great addition to the room if there was a kettle with tea bags we requested a kettle but it was unfortunately dirty and we didn t end up using it also we wanted to use the ipads but everyday they would be none left but other than that it was a great stay
