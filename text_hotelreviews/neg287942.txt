starting from the arrival at the hotel no guidance was provided on where we should get dropped off as the hotel is in a pedestrian lane the ideal solution would be for the hotel staff to speak with the taxi driver and provide them with the exact drop off location we had to walk mins through lanes to find our way and it was not comfortable for first time visitors with children after having read stories of pick pocketers the check in area et is extremely slow as they are grossly understaffed house keeping is pathetic we were there for nights they did not vaccume the room as sand was there for days after we visited d the beach and the cleaning was sub standard a double bed had a single blanket and the blanket cover was provided separately for us to complete the needful a lot of noise in the room from the outside and light penetrating through the bathroom door they need door stoppers and people tend to bang the doors in the middle of the night which is very disturbing the hotel staff and least helpful in case you need any assistance with any tourist guidance some staff were helpful christina who did put in an extra effort to help but overall the service experience was sub standard for a hotel rated as high on booking com the breakfast was average but there are a lot of cafes at la ramblas after repeated complaints they included breakfast in our room package for days but the customer service experience is frustrating when your on a holiday lastly there is no security at the hotel anyone can walk in and out of the hotel access the stairways and reach your room no checks and controls in place
