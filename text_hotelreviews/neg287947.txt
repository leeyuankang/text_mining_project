the air con was pathetic and only worked to a minimal degree staff said it couldn t be improved our solution was to leave it on all day whilst we were out as otherwise we returned to a hot room this meant that the light outside the room was on and the maid therefore didn t try and service the room maybe an old fashioned knock might have been sensible we borrowed the free bikes and within a mile a pedal had fallen off my bike in the middle of a very busy junction we hobbled back but it couldn t be repaired as the mechanic was awol i speak some spanish so could understand the phone call to try and locate the guy so we did without another lady saw us and said the same had happened to her the day before and we saw the bike being returned the next day with the same problem not impressed
