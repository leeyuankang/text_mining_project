it started off good and then everything went downhill the moment i spotted an ant in the bathroom at first it was only ants in the bathroom so we didn t take notice it wasn t until we spotted large ones with wings that we complained to front desk they moved us to a different room and told us specifically that the problem will be sorted and there ll be no ants we then had to be moved back to our cleaned original room claiming there s no ants next day a whole nest of ants came out from a whole in the wall running all around the room walls and ceiling one of the staff blamed it on me eating an apple in the room saying we shouldn t eat in the room absurdity why have room service then we complained demanding to speak to the manager awful service from staff especially marc rude and avoided our questions answered back as though we were in the wrong no compensation or explanation inadequate training of staff worst hotel experience i ve ever had they do not deserve the star rating
