we didn t appreciate a new staff member raising her voice to tell us our card was declined turns out the card wasn t declined at all she attempted to charge us times and thankfully one of the cards she attempted to charge she was told not to use it bounced as it had expired however she did successfully take amounts out of my boyfriends account the staff were not very helpful when it came to this issue one staff member telling us she didn t know if her coworker contacted visa and didn t seem too bothered to help when i insisted she did check thankfully there was a lovely staff member graham i believe can t recall his name who helped us after previously dealing with other staff members it really soured our trip granted these things happen but the way it was dealt with wasn t what you d expect from such a hotel
