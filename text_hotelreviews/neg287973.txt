check in time was pm i arrived at and was told that no room was ready returning at i had to queue with all the other guests who wanted to check in at the same time ridiculous the rooms are extremely small the booking process originally stated garden view later this had disappeared and the room of course was located to a small extremely narrow street with no light but noisy people even when you turn off the air condition there will still be a loud noise in the room ear plugs recommended ridiculously overpriced
