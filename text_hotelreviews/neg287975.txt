the ac was not effective also ac was facing the kids bed making the ac blow directly to the kids the main bed was little away from the ac and hence was not getting the enough ac effect also the bathroom design was the worst i have seen so far in all of my trips there is no shelf for the toileteries making it all wet in a single use of the washbasin there is water everywhere in the bathroom after a shower since there is no door to the shower area
