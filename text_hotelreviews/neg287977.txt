some staff were rude first they didnt tell us about the bike rentals until we found out upon check out they refused to give us bathroom slippers saying those are reserved for suites only and they refused to give us a plug since our cables are different than europe s cables until we insisted the room doesn t have a mirror except in the bathroom which is incovenient for two girls on holidays the shower does not have a door or curtain so the place turns into a swimming pool everytime we shower and finally upon check out i was carrying my big wedding dress in its wrapping and we came down leaving our suitcases in the room assuming someone would bring them down like every other hotel in the world the guy at the reception told us we should bring them down ourselves and went back to typing on his computer then we asked to keep our suitcases in the storage room since our flight was at midnight and they wouldnt extend our checkout past pm he showed us the storage room and it was a disaster there was no way i was keeping my wedding dress in there with our suitcases then another guy was kind enough to open another room for us and we kept our things there the bar restaurant were we watched the final champions league in tv is too small volume too low all in all i would not recommend this hotel to anyone despite its excellent location the staff need to have more manners with guests
