being a junior suite it accommodated a family of unfortunately although the description states that the extra beds are sofa beds this leaves you no where to sit other than on your bed i have to say i do not think the single sofabeds were suitable sleeping on the bottom sheet was placed directly on the leather sofa without a topper mattress so it was very hot and sweaty my kids didn t complain but i think for a room of that size a better quality sofa bed is needed i also think a tea coffee making facility should be provided we had a kettle but nothing else
