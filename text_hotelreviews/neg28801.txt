room was way too small photos very deceiving had to put our second luggage on top of wardrobe and bring it up and down each time we needed it less than feet passage way between bed and hanging tv on wall no space for two people to move around in room one of us had to stay all the time on the bed this made our stay in the room very uncomfortable and frustrating very very small room
