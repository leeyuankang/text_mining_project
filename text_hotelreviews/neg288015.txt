noise so noisy in all rooms no noise insulation at all between rooms doors bedroom doors being banged through to am by inconsiderate guests guests congregating in corridors in the middle of the night instead of going to their rooms we had an outside room that had an alley narrow road running alongside it location it is central to la rambla and not even on the main road but not a great place at night hotel room we had a floor outside facing room that was large but didn t have much in the way of natural light due to the buildings the other side of the alley and a large window with the shutters closed due to a garden lift the other side of it we asked to be moved to a higher floor with natural light and was told the hotel was fully booked although we could have been moved to an adapted room for the disabled had a look online and what a surprise i could have booked a double room for the night so clearly they did have a room to move us to definitely ask for an internal room as our room was on the outside next to the alley we had the pleasure of prostitutes along the alley outside the room they were eventually being moved on once the police arrived not quite sure why it took so long to move them on but an hour later they were all still there having a heated discussion as the window was as soundproofed as well as the rooms and doors were we may of well have had the window open ask for internal rooms hairdryers we had separate rooms booked not one of the hairdryers worked properly if at all actually they were all dangerous so ladies take your own if you want a late check out the charge would be although you can leave your bags with them once you have checked out
