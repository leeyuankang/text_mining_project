due to the hotel s location the main entrance is opposite a british style football bar which is up my alley but wouldn t suit every traveller las ramblas is well known for being dodgy at all hours with pickpockets and prostitution common i was offered drugs along the route outside the front doors and would recommend fellow tourists to be mindful these facts do not change how i feel about the hotel but need to be taken into consideration
