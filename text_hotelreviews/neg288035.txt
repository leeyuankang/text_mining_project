we stayed over the new year the location was fantastic and first person we encountered at the desk was very helpful we had to pay up front though and then the service went downhill our shower and bath was completely blocked after the first shower and there was no option to move the bunk bed made a crazy loud and painful squeak that woke up my other friends with any movement at all they fixed the bath on the second day but then it broke again for our third day the bells from the nearby churches also go off regularly and we had to keep windows open as room was extremely hot with no option to control room temp
