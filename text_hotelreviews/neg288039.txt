there was not much information about the facilities and the staff were not very informative the hotel layout was poor with a grand entrance but we went up to our rooms through a back staircase with a laundry trolley blocking the landing our room looked out onto a back alley which was very noisy late at night and also early morning emptying bottles the shower screen and wash basin leaked in the bathroom
