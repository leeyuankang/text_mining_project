breakfast is poor with a very small food selection and almost no hot food choices check in takes ages we specifically asked for separate beds upon booking and afterwards during check in yet we got a room with a double bed which was inconvenient given we were travelling with a friend when we called reception to clarify the answer was these are two separate beds they are just together d needless to say the beds could not be separated overall definitely not a european hotel max
