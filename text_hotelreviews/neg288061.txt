we had a family room up to people for three persons however the room was very tiny we also missed a mirrow above the table it was really difficult to enter the balcony as the door was right beside one bed after our first night the cleaning person took our three towels and replaced them with only two clean towels we had to call to reception as also the bathroom mat and hand towels were forgotten the hotel staff were ok when we asked their help or advices in general i think they were not very professionals not saying hello or good night etc when walking by
