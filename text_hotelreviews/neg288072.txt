cleanliness wasn t good at all you can see accumulated dust under beds once the maid came to clean the room and there was someone in it she putted new towels and didn t come back to clean when the room was empty and we wasn t sure that towels were changed everyday and we paid some of the amount by credit card and we were surprised that someone took the next day an amount of money from my credit card without my agreement so i was obliged to stop my credit card and to change it when i came back to lebanon
