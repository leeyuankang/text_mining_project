one particular staff xavier who handled our check in was particularly rough i asked him to lower his voice we were a group of coming in from los angeles a long flight and his impatience was palpable when people are in the service industry they need to add on an extra layer of courtesy and respect especially for traveling passengers we are a well traveled family and aware of the european regulations with respect registration his tone demeanor voice nearly yelling was not appreciated i told him twice in a stern voice to lower his voice and his response was to say that was his normal tone of voice fingernails dirty appearance unkempt were things i also noticed about him that man did not want to be there
