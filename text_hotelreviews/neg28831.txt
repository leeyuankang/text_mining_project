don t consider it if it is your first trip to london and you want to be in the middle of it all and or if you do not love walking distances or taking the underground none of the electrical outlets worked to charge my phone but then i was there for one night no big deal don t fall for the upsell when you check in get what you ordered there is a reason why you did not order breakfast not sure you will be up by then lol and why you do not want to join their dinner for sure there are restaurants open on boxing day few but nonetheless
