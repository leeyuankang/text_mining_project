we booked triple rooms for us our daughters and their families i checked days before that we had the triple rooms again when i checked in and when we got to our rooms only double beds eventually one daughters room was changed to double and two single beds the other was given a single bed which made the space quite tight luckily there was extra beds available i hate to think what would of happened if they were not available also the reception desk has not enough staff to deal with guests checking in and out and deal with luggage and queries not sure i d call this a star hotel
