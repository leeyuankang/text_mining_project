the road in front of the hotel was under construction by bus it may take up to minutes plus to get to marble arch the house keeping in the hotel is till pm you have to be out of the room by that time or your room will not be cleaned the room card is also used for the lift to get you to your room but it is sensitive enough to activate the lift you may remain for minutes or more trying to get the lift to function
