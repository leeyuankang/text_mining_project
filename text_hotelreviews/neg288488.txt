both air conditioning units in the room need servicing as they were very noisy making it difficult to sleep with them turned on during the night taxi to our hotel dropped us off at the incorrect location there is more than one mercer hotel in this area we had to then walk with all our luggage to the correct location thankfully we were assisted by the hotel staff to find the correct hotel the taxi driver s disappointed us in barcelona by firstly dropping us off at the wrong location but also getting annoyed with us when we tried to pay with card rather than cash to my mind a taxi driver should be annoyed if you can t pay the fare he was very rude
