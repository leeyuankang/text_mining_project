the charge for breakfast was and it was not worth this and my husband and i were actually annoyed by this there was a lovely lady there who would cook you eggs but only fries or scrambled there was no other hot foods the actual buffet was small with limited choice so ditch the brekkie the room was spacious nice and it was comfy but it was not clean and there was some work needed done to it like plastering and the bathroom need work there was also not a lot of hot water so the shower was luke warm this would not have normal bothered me as the room was nice but for the cost of the hotel i didn t expected that
