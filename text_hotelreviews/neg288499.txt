no real issues very minor and didn t really bother me at all i loved the room overall the rooms are quite dark despite lots of lamps because its more of a boutique hotel conversion high ceilings dark wood this wasn t a major issue for me but a little more overhead lighting might have been better or you could consider it romantic if there with a partner there was also a bit of a smell from the drains in the bathroom at times but i think this was more a problem in bcn as some street drains were equally whiffy in the area the kitchenette has basic cutlery but no cooking utensils so more heat eat buy prepared rather than actual cooking option but i didn t need this for my stay
