when we came back from the theater me and my partner decided to have a drink at the bar my partner was asked what he would like but he wanted to see the wine menu first so once he went back to the bar minutes later the bartender tells him he can no longer pay by car or cash and can only room charge it it would have been really ideal if he told us that from the start instead of wasting time looking t the menu only to discover we had to go back out for a drink
