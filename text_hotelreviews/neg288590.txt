when we arrived we were put in room in the red section at the front of the hotel it is not air conditioned and the street below is very noisy with cars and trams with temperatures in the high c there was an uncomfortable catch you could be quiet and very hot or cool relatively speaking and noisy after our first night we asked to be moved to the blue section at the back of the hotel we were put into room which was very nice and was air conditioned apart from a baby crying across the street it was very quiet
