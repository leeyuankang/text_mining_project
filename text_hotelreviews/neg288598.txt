the hotel is renovating and this is something i would have gladly been told when i contacted the hotel last week or when we checked in there was a sign in the elevator about the renovations this is how we found out and the fact that the buttons of the elevator were hidden under tape the corridor of our room was under construction and workman started at in the morning also during the weekend just mentioning the renovation in advance or a simple question about it at checkout would have been nice and acceptable
