we were not allowed a kettle in the room so i couldn t get a decent cup of tea all stay and in the hotel info in the room we were told we would not be allowed to use any electrical appliance not owned by the hotel although they didn t explain how we would charge our phones the big problem came the morning we checked out as we had a late flight we wanted to take advantage of the noon checkout and have a lie in however at we were woken up to banging and drilling coming from all around it was like being in a building site when i phoned to complain i was told i didn t understand and that the rooms had to be renervated they eventually apologised and gave us the last night free of charge but i would still rather have had a good night sleep
