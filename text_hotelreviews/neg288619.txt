for a hotel the furniture was definitely too old and in bad shape my room had an old door with a gap at the bottom that was so big that light came in from the hall consequently there was no sound barrier whatsoever to the hall the window was old too and not tight enough to keep the wind out it was basically an old and rather run down room pimped with some new wallpaper and thankfully also a new bathroom
