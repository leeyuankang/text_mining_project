i never got past the lobby a taxi arrived and i was driven away from the boutique viennart in the city center to a less desirable area of the city to check in at a chain hotel a stones throw from the westbahnhof the room i was given was perfectly adequate and had i been looking for a budget hotel i would have been quite pleased however i wound up paying over for two nights in an average accommodation in a sketchy part of town well away from the city center when i had deliberately booked at a higher rate expecting both location and accommodation of a certain quality
