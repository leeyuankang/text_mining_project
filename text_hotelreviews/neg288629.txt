street facing side was much louder than i d like i stayed in a junior suite on that side but i didn t care for the noise the smaller room on the backside of the hotel was much quieter although the room was smaller as usual parking pretty much anywhere in europe is a painful experience suffice it to say you ll park about three blocks away and a bit tricky to get too on a good note though the parking area is clean and secure and dare i say spacious for europe anyway another good point is reduced parking cost for the hotel that s more like a plus plus
