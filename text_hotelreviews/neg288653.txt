the hotel had no charm the shower was very small and had no shelf on which to place toiletries no wash clothes were provided nor was bar soap however liquid soap was by the sink and in the shower i did not like that if you did not pay for the breakfast you could not even get coffee until after noon i was in an upgraded double room it was very small i understand this is common in europe and looked more like a college dorm room there was no air conditioning they provided a floor fan and the window opened but there was no screen and with the window being equal to the roof i was uncomfortable leaving it open my friends had an upgraded double room it was much nicer and had air conditioning
