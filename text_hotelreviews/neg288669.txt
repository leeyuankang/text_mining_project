we only stayed one night the person who checked us in was pleasant and efficient however the check out process the next morning was not handled so well at peak departure time the only available receptionist first spent several minutes explaining sightseeing information to a couple checking in early then with a line of people waiting to check out she twice was willing to let a queue jumper push to the front she explained that he was only going to be quick because he was checking out others who were there for the purpose pointed out to her and the queue jumper they had been waiting patiently in hope of the same quick service this was strike one strike two was that when i eventually got served the same receptionist said i needed to pay for two breakfasts charged to my room the day before it took her a while to comprehend that we had only checked in the previous evening fortunately there was no strike three against somebody who was apparently having a rough sunday morning aside it always id wise to check one s the bill at hotels before paying my advice to the hotel manager is she or he needs to ensure that all their reception staff are trained to serve customers in an efficient and courteous manner otherwise our stay was perfectly satisfactory
