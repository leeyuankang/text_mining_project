value for money is terrible breakfast is overpriced terrible wifi disconnecting all the time and requiring relogin every few minutes expect small rooms that look nothing extra could use renovation and a very noisy surroundings the walls are paper thin and you hear even tv of the guest in next room when they start cleaning other rooms early in the morning prepare to be waken up by incredibly old and noisy vacuum cleaner i was really disappointed by the overall style of the rooms didnt look comfy at all and i see no reason why this hotel deserves the star ive been in much nicer hotels
