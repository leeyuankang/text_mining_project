small room wouldn t class as hotel lobby is lovely but rooms arent great beds were heavily scratched corridors were noisy you have to physically lock the door with your key on the inside which poses a fire risk rooms were stuffy the most annoying thing was that they had made my bed up in a twin room under a wall lamp that i must of hit my head off a dozen times in the nights i stayed because they intellegently placed the light directly above your head in the perfect spot to hit it sitting up or getting out of bed what away to start the morning with a little light concussion
