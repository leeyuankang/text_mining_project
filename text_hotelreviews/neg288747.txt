room was incredibly hot with no apparent way to control temperature we had to sleep with window open which meant we woke up at about when traffic noise began trams were particulary loud i suspect had we not been at the front of the hotel it would have been bearable the ideal of course would be that they provided manual control for heating controlling in the room i would however stay again but ask for room at rear
