the noise i really wanted to give the hotel a great score as so much is good about it but that s difficult to do when out of a night stay you don t get a single good night s sleep the road noise is fine and the beds comfortable but the walls are paper thin so you can hear everything your fellow guests are doing saying each night we were woken up either by doors banging tv s on coughing and spluttering talking or even other guests banging walls at their noisy neighbours you might think its not the hotel s fault if our neighbours were noisy but they weren t really you should be able to have your tv on or even cough without the worry of disturbing the guests next door the double room cost under per night which is brilliant for the location and everything else but take your ear plugs and probably avoid if you re a light sleeper
