we spent one night in an old room an executive studio presented to us as a free up grade shortly ugly thing for the upcoming nights we were moved to a renovated room after complaining we asked for an extra day and expected to have the same rate but they increased the price we took the offer just to avoid all time lost to move to another place but the level of customer service is poor although we booked a room for adults and one child breakfast included they charged us an extra amount for the kid s breakfast about euros no big deal although a child s breakfast is mostly milk and cereals but they told us about this only at the check out which again is not professional
