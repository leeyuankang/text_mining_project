there is no air conditioning which turns this hotel into a hell during the hot summer days and nights the hotel does not have its own parking and it is almost impossible to find a free parking lot in the neighborhood there is only a shower in the and no bathtub in the bathroom which is quite unusual for a four star hotel the rooms towards the street are extremely noisy because of the trams and the traffic the does not stop the whole night
