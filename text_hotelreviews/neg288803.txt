upon arrival at our room wasn t ready despite four stars this hotel didn t have aircon and in a viennese summer that smply doesn t work especially when you put people right under the roof where it continues to be hot long after the streets have cooled down only one side of the bed had a single electrical socket which should suit all your needs in barely any natural light in the room as windows only from above and no way to look out without standing on the bed
