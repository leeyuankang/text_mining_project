problem in the bar with getting served but not really the the fault of the staff member she was trying to manage alone during a busy period with a queue of customers each time she took cash she had to leave the bar through a side door and go to the restaurant area till to process the transaction there was some confusion with orders unsurprisingly but not her fault at all we felt sorry for the duty manager when some clients were over enthusiastic with their complaint he did very well to remain calm as the people who complained seemed to be the worse for wear when they arrived we also had to wait a considerable length of time to order our two drinks but there s no need to be rude we d definitely stay here again and hope they d sorted out their till problem and put some extra staff on for busy periods
