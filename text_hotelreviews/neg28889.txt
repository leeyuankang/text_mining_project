started off with the receptionist asking if i was a male or a female lol it was funny but i mean really i can t remember what reason she gave for why she asked me when i laughed and was like what noisy staff in hallway in the early afternoon before we left for dinner and again in the late evening and again in the morning speaking in very loud voices no care that they might be disturbing paying guests regardless of what time of day it is staff going in and out of rooms nearby ours and let doors slam shut sounded like they were doing some work in the neighbouring room s there was a constant scraping noise i hope this was building work and not mice in the walls we were located on the floor so i had high hopes of little to no noise misleading pictures on booking com standard double room is very small the pictures made out like the standard double room was much larger than it was disappointing when the room is highly priced the bathroom is super tiny and so of course the doorway is small and yet they have made it into a double doorway that swings open bit of a design fail
