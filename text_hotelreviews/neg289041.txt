the hotel is located in a residential and industrial area far away from an tourist attractions or airport especially stn airport it taxi cost from the stn to this hotel is pound one way and it took us and half hour to get to the hotel the closest public transportation is minutes walking the closest restaurant pub is min walking as well and it is pretty shabby it is actually a local bar which serves burgers and fries and some other fast food the neighborhood does not look clean or safe some hotel staffs were new and not well prepared to answer question about hotel amenity there wasn t much to do around the hotel when i wanted to use the gym at a little pass i was told it was on floor when i got there it is a spa but the door was locked i returned to the front desk to inquire about how to access the gym and pool i was told the operation hour is from am pm as such i didn t do much for the rest of the day the next morning i went to the front desk again to ask about the gym usage i was surprised to find out it open hours a day she seems to be more knowledgeable about the hotel amenity she told me to access the gym and pool after you need to use floor and a special key to access it unfortunately i had to leave for the airport without enjoying the facility my recommendation for the tourists is to find a hotel close to the attraction like i did the first time when i visited london apex city hotel is way better it is less than minutes walking from the tower of london but is still very quiet because it is on a back street you can beat the tourist by visiting the tower at am loved that experience
