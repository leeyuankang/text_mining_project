the air conditioning was not working for the first night i was stuck in a boiling hot room with no opening windows and absolutely no fresh air it was awful the hotel only offered me discount off my first night when i am sure they should have given me a full refund off the first night i don t even think it was legal to allow us to stay in those rooms
