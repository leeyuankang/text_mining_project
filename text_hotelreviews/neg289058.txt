we really didn t like that we couldn t get picked up from the train station and that the shuttle was not hours the neighbourhood was a little bit sketchy and the hotel is well hidden in between buildings and back alleys so it would have been nice to get a ride we eventually figured out the bus system but it was a pain the first couple of days we went to the hotel restaurant one of the nights and it was awful they had one waiter on which would have been fine considering there were only or tables to serve but he spent minutes talking to the table next to us and then it took another for him to come over to us to talk to us for the first time since we had been seated i ordered off of the kids menu a margarita pizza and fries which turned out to be half of a frozen store bought pizza which i figured out when i asked for less sauce on the pizza and he told me they were pre made my husband got a burger and the meat was the cheapest you could buy it was very fatty and very grey the whole dinner service for meals drink and a dessert took an hour a half we ordered one dessert to split and it turned out to be one tiny individual sized lava cake and the tiniest scoop of ice cream i ve ever seen it would have been nice for him to let us know how small it was since it wasn t really suitable to split the whole meal was around pounds which for the poor service and the very bad quality of the food was a fortune the hallways were excruciatingly hot as well as the room when we first got in and the temperature in the room does not lower beyond degrees celsius which we found uncomfortable for sleeping either the system in the room resets or the maid resets it every day as well so each evening when we came back we would have to wait for the temperature to lowered again the system they use for the tv was terrible it was very slow and and very glitchy and it took forever just to choose one channel to watch
