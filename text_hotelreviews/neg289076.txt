the hydro pool was broken and very cold it was also very dark in the spa and found it hard to see high chlorine really hurt our eyes and the smell was strong we had a service fee added to our bill after lunch in the restaurant which i myself found appalling in hampshire we do not add these burgers and half pints of pepsi came to a whopping i would suggest to eat out
