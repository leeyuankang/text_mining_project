the bed appeared to be two single beds pushed together we were sinking down the middle of the bed my partner and i were very uncomfortable despite discussing with neel the receptionist after the first night we had yet another uncomfortable nights sleep as nothing had changed despite neel assuring me he would sort it also we ordered a drink at the bar which was automatically added to our room bill however when we decided to settle the bill at the bar two drinks ended up costing us and that was for a gin tonic and rum coke when my partner queried the cost the bar man explained standard measures we re double measures i have never heard anything so silly in my life if we wanted a double we would have asked also the bar mans response was what s the matter short are you how rude left my partner feeling belittled i believe this to be a dangerous providing people with double measures i was unaware i was drinking a standard double we did receive discount off hotel price which was ok but i felt disheartened by the hotel which was the only disappointing part of our romantic trip to london
