the tv needs to been updated with a different system as its quite rigid and temperamental the tv in the bathroom took a few attempts to turn on and off whilst i was having a relaxing bath there was a continuous high pitched noise i think it was the pipes maybe it was quite annoying the view from our deluxe room wasn t that great as it showed in the picture
