we had to carry our own bags to the room even thought there was members of staff standing there doing nothing at reception wasnt told when the spa facilities closed or opened so we didnt get to use any for our whole stay wasnt told about the deposit i would have to make on arrival for the room at all so if i didnt carry any cards with me but only a limited amount of money i would of been stuck after paying fully for the room in advance
