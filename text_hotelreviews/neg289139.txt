location might be a tad out of the way for some but suited me to a tee as i was staying near friends who live in battersea if you are happy to utilise their free shuttle to clapham junction station or catch buses everywhere which is what i did as it was very easy then this is excellent value price wise for the kind of standard that might be unaffordable right in central london
