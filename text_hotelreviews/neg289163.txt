i upgraded my room but would of loved to see what the standard looked like as i could not see any difference the room was tiny a travelodge is bigger couldn t even swing a cat on the page it said i paid for seating area but if you class a small table and a chair that s not even big enough for a dressing table a seating area then there s no hope really disappointed
