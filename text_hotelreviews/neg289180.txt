as we only eat halal which the hotel doesn t accommodate which we knew we naturally turn to vegetarian options as i was waiting for some hash browns to come out i saw that they had been put on the same tray that bacon had been on so i had to ask for a fresh batch and only got between me n my husband and we felt away to ask for more so i felt that ruined our breakfast on our last day other then that food was good but was a bit of a wait nothing was out at the same time but was other stuff available while u wait waiting staff were very friendly and helpful and cheffs was a nice range of foods available yogurts and nuts fruits cereals and pastry cheeses salmon n juices was all good xxx would recommend
