having traced her steps back carefully my girlfriend realised she had left a new hat in a bag in the room when she phoned up the following day very little attention seemed to be payed to this despite her explaining that it was an expensive hat and she was sure it had to be there i didn t like being asked to hand over my car key and told that this would be an extra per night a phrase like would you like to use the hotel s car park would have made a better impression rather than being felt like i was being ordered to do so in the event i left my car directly across the road and it was just fine the next question was would i like to join your customer loyalty scheme it seemed very early to ask but given the issues with the lost hat i can see why we had to wait around minutes before being able to check in as the man in front of us was engaged in a lengthy but circular argument about why he list discounts on his total package just because he has added a breakfast overall what could have been a great experience in a well appointed hotel was marred by poor staff
