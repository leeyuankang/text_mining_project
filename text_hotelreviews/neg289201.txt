some of the staff were less than impressive i was promised shuttle service to clapham junction would be waiting for me when i returned from work never happened and the staff then watched me sitting in the lobby for half an hour without even acknowledging my presence or offering an apology not great after i spent nights staying there how much effort would it have been to run me minutes down the road with a car waiting outside
