the hotel is above a petrol station so from the outside looks like it won t be much but actually the rooms etc are great so don t be put off only minor thing is the pillows are not very comfy a bit cheap so an upgrade on the quality here would improve the overall comfort the interior of the wardrobe could also do with a quick paint to bring up to the standards of the rest of the room however a very minor aesthetic issue that didn t detract from a great stay overall
