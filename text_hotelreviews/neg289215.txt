i know it could possible be abit extreme but i think it would be a good idea to add the option to go onto the internet using the tv to allow the chance to possibly use a netflix etc account that some people may have this will allow people to be able to watch more things using the tv but like i said it may be abit extreme for all the rooms to have it so if it does not have that then it will not put me off what so ever
