i was put in a room with a broken door handle literally hanging off however was assured the door still worked properly upon leaving the room and trying to re enter the handle completely broke off leaving us locked out though the staff moved us into the room next door this inconvenience wasted a lot of time for me and my partner as we were celebrating his birthday we simply shouldn t have been put in a room with a broken door
