even though there was a tv in the bathroom i couldn t manage to turn it on no matter what i tried we ve also had dinner in the hotels restaurant but wasn t too impressed with this we first ordered a pizza that was hands on the worst pizza i ve ever had the base was smushy and looked like those cheap bases you can buy from a supermarket to make your own it also looked like it was a cake rather than a pizza with orange tomato sauce also i could have gone without the random phonecall in the morning that almost gave me a heart attack as i was sleeping and have them hang up on me when answered i assume it was an honest mistake so i didn t bring it up when checking out also i would recommend if you re walking from clapham junction to the hotel to think again especially at night the area we walked through looks very very very shady and we were almost sure we were going to be robed or worse so definitely take a taxi or a bus stops at york gardens which is right in front of the hotel
