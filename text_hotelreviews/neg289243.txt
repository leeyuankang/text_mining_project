had dinner in restaurant food was good and also the service but restaurant was freezing cold asked waitress about it but she was obviously unable to convince restaurant manager as when we mentioned it to him he shrugged it off with is it don t like the fact that people who smoke can waltz out on to the verandah for a cigarette the door opening and closing did not help to keep what heat there was in the dining room smokers should have to go out to the entrance to smoke not disturb diners
