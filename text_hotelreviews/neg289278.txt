check in was below standard done by a trainee whom was not friendly at all simply rude for a star hotel not acceptable we needed to make an urgent call and he informed us of an price and after finding out his quote was completely off and it ended up costing us a fortune didn t explain anything upon checking later on we asked the manager an australian gave us the needed details room temperature was way to hot and not manageable facilities in the room was half empty regarding the coffee and tea and mini bar was empty we found the hotel to be very expensive given its locations as we stayed in central london convent garden earlier and it was more reasonable location not ideal we only booked their for twickenham stadium another duty manager a lady assisted us by reducing the cost of our call which we appreciated wont be going back to the hotel anytime soon not worth the price we stayed in a in ireland where we had a magical time cant say the same for crown plaza
