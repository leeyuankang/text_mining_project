when checking out was not happy with the way one of the staff members was talking to us when checking in a payment for the room plus deposit was taken then when checking out we was asked for the payment for the room again after asking why as we had given payment when checking in the member of staff did not explain and made me feel very uncomfortable making me out to feel stupid of why i m asking this question it took another member of staff to explain why they was doing it which still made no sense for us to finally make another reluctant payment now i am waiting for one of the payments to go back into my account as two payments was taken which i new would happen wouldn t expect this to happen at the price you pay for this hotel we have stayed here before and been happy but now i would never stay there again
