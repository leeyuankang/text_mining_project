they don t have enough staff working at the restaurant during breakfast i asked for a pair of fork and knife but apparently the waiter was too busy and he forgot to bring that for me i tried to ask from another but there wasn t in the end the waiter brought me one though later i don t think it s his fault as he worked hard to serve people but the hotel should have more waiters during the breakfast
