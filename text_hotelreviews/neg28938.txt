the attitude of one of the staff members at the reception when dealing with the late check out request was appalling i have requested a late check out when booking via booking com yet it seemed that there was no communication or updates to the hotel regarding this matter therefore my card did not work on the elevator nor in the bedrooms when approached to the reception i was disturbed by the attitude shown by the member of staff at the desk
