no storage space for anything other than hanging clothes no space for my suitcase the tv was poor very grainy picture the menu guide and info buttons on the remote did nothing so it was difficult to find the normal channels some which actually weren t even there and the radio only had stations compared to premier inn the technology side was poor if i d paid full price for my stay i would have been more upset to have a poor tv in a luxury hotel however the fault card in the rooms allow you to call repairs to attention excellent idea
