we had a problem with the shower water was boiling hot but was fixed asap also complimentary mini bar had half eaten snacks and bath robes had a packet of opened cigarettes so could do with housekeeping checking these areas these are just small areas to improve on but staff were very helpful and we enjoyed our stay overall
