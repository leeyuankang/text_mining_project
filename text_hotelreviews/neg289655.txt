i have been coming to this hotel for the past years and although it s been recently refurbished under new management the bathrooms seem to have been made smaller and the bath replaced by a shower which my year old grandson did not enjoy very much they also laid down a sofa bed for my grandson and my daughter who had to lay down next to him until he fell asleep found it very uncomfortable the mattress was too thin and depending where you sat on it the bottom half of the frame would tend to raise from the floor the room could have done with a new sofa bed seeing as the room rates have gone up considerably
