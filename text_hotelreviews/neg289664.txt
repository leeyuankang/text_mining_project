sorry to say that but some of the front disk staff was rude the front disk lady that she helped me during the check out was impolite and trying to embarrass me infront of may family and this is when i told her that i called room service to bring my luggage down as she start laughing and talking loudly and saying no no no room service is for food services only and not for luggage as also the other front disk lady beside her was laughing and you can feel the impolitness of the staff i did not want to talk and argue with her in front of my family as i felt that she does not have the basic and fundamentals in how to deal with customers as well as she does not know that all services provided to the people within the hotel are by it self considered as services whether it is under room service front disk concierge or any other
