we ordered from external resturant and the delivery man in casual clothing not a uniform came all the way to our room which never happened to me elsewhere always i get a call to pick up from the reception felt it was not safe to be fair delivery was from a third party so maybe they knew the company another thing you ll not always find a guard standing the hotel was so crowded and anyone not staying in the hotel and come lifts without acess cards without being noticed found that not safe comparing to other hotels i ve been in london
