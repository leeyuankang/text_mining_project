i am walking disabled which i mentioned when i booked and asked for a room within easy reach the one we were assigned for was far far away from the lifts it took my wife and a very helpful lady receptionist some time and long walks to find a room closer by and this was still quite a bit away from the lifts this hotel is totally unsuitable for disabled persons the lobby is high up on the floor there is an escalator only on the way up down you have to use a normal staircase if you here want to use the one lift to get to the ground floor this is often blocked by hotel business luggage linen etc th rooms themselves are to be reached by corridors miles long since there is only one set of lifts in one corner of the hotel which covers a whole block
