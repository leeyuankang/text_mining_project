the cleaner seemed to have finished our room in a rush there were black hairs in the bath and around the floor by the toilet there were still request for breakfast cards completed by the previous occupant hanging on the door the lighting in the room was horrendous brace yourself to discover you have cellulite in places you didn t even know it was possible to get cellulite after seeing yourself in the mirror under these bulbs even the most body confident will consider keeping the lights off on a romantic weekend with this unflattering lighting the pillows were soft to the point of being completely pointless i woke up with neck ache on both mornings and there appeared to be a zip running down the middle of the duvet inside the duvet cover this was pretty uncomfortable if you sat on the bed on top of the duvet although the wifi was free it was a terrible connection it constantly kept dropping off and i had to keep signing in every time i wanted to use it my partner had the same problem
