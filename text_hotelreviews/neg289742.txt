we had fire alarms one was at and one day later we had another at midnight on both occasions we had to evacuate the hotel in chilly weather and walk to a nearby hotel until the fire brigade had declared it safe while i have to applaud the staff for their safe and efficient evacuation i was disappointed by the lack of communication from management as to the reason for false alarms
