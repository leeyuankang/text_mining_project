poor value for money the problem with the broken lifts during the christmas time was a real disaster there are only very slow lifts available in this relatively large hotel two of which were out of order during days of our stay there the customers were forced to use stairs which was at least inconvenient and became a real pain for those who stayed above floor e g our room was on floor and particularly for those who had suitcases to carry the hotel management made neither attempts to sort this issue out nor to apologize for inconvenience caused by this failure this is exceptionally poor performance for the price they charged us for the room try to avoid this hotel by any means
