the elevator wait was horrible elevators but are being repaired throughout my days stay no queing at all so usually we will need to wait two rounds until we get in one most days we would opt for walking floors the smell was terrible in the hotel very cheap and strong perfume smell the shower case makes a cracking noise every time we close it sounds like the door might break it was leaking too on my last day the service at the complimentary lounge was also terrible no one to serve you most of the time the food at the grill restaurant was also terrible mains came before entree which took us hours to be served food was terrible too to make it worse unquestionably our worst meal during the trip
