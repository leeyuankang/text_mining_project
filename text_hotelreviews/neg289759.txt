i was accused of smoking in the room when i hadn t a security guard came banging on the door at around am accusing us of smoking when we told her we didn t she didn t believe us and barged into the room without permission she searched the room including the windows and found nothing next she asked us where we smoked and we said outside she didn t like the answer so she decided to threaten us and said i know that nobody likes to get caught and i will not try to prove anything this time but if you are caught smoking you will be charged with a fine if you want the money just say so but don t accuse people for something they haven t done
