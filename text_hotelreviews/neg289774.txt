the shower doesn t have a door and the water keeps leaking out on the bathroom floor also the housekeeper was quite lazy that she he did not clean up our trashes on the table such as finished cup noodles dirty tissues etc understand they might have concern of not cleaning up trashes beyond the trash bin but at least for obvious trashes like finished cup noodles chocolate wrap they should help throw it away during our stay
