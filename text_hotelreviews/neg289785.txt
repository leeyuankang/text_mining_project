i havf been staying in this property for the past almost years when i come to london but i am disappointed with no improvements of the lifts facilities only four lifts to transport the whole hotel of flours of which at least one of the lefts stayes out of order for a long time and quite often two out of order in the same time this what happened to us for the whole week we stayed in i can tell you you can wait for long long time to get a ride down another thing the breakfast resturant is quit busy and line could strech all the way to the reception area waiting to get in so see little food veriaty better to have your breakfast outside
