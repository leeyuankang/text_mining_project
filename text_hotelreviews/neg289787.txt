this is a big hotel and feels often overcrowded especially at breakfast time i do not appreciate vaporisers sprayer that you smell everywhere in my opinion very artificial very limited window opening not possible to get much fresh air in my room was very quiet but if you get a room from oxford street site i suppose it may be quite noisy when i stayed there lifts were broken out of so it was a long time waiting we stayed or floor
