the deli cafe is a embarrassment to the hotel totally understaffed they don t seem to no if they offer table service or self service the staff do not work together we started using this cafe as the night before i brought a bottle of champagne in the bar celebrating my friend becoming a grandmother but the place stank of rotton egg so we never stayed for another bottle i invited my sister mum for a luxury weekend away xmass shopping as i normally stay here on business it was a logical choice very disappointing the next day my mum wanted some soup so we asked the staff what the soup of the day was to be informed sweet potato carrot however onion soup arrived soup spoons took mins to arrive and no bread as per menu because my mum is diabetic she ate her s i never and left without eating i informed the waiter that this was the wrong soup to be told he worked in the restaurant then left so i spoke with the nice lady behind the counter which went to find a manager magdeleue sat down with me and thanked me for the feedback refunded me the money back to my card then reserved me a table for breakfast in the deli however when i got there no table was reserved and nothing special was organised she left me a receipt with a note in my room explaining her colleagues avviud ausve would be on duty i had to ask to be served and the waitress was walking around tidying up menus didn t even acknowledge us coming in gave us a look of death when we asked for coffee due to my early flight we didn t have time to leave the hotel to find breakfast top it all off lifts was broken down so had to take the stairs from the floor as the other lifts was taken ages to get to everyone i m normally the most relaxed person when it comes to problem but this hotel was a real let down and embarrassed me in front of my guest family
