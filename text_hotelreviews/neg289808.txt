breakfast the chefs mentality is bad and they are to lazy i ask various times for two fried eggs sunny side up and there was nobody else there on that point of time the chef who was preparing the eggs said i will ask them in the kitchen minutes later two eggs came looks like two poaches eggs no where near two fried eggs so i ask what is this the chef said eggs i said i want normal fried eggs he said oh this the way we do it and he walked on the side doesn t even border to make two normal sunny side up eggs next day i told my wife lets try our luck again i ask for sunny side up eggs now even worse he said you can get it from there he pointed to pre fried eggs warmer all eggs look like poach eggs i went and complain to the waiter but on the end nobody cares there housekeepers walk in to the rooms in the same time they knock on the door i was in the toilet and house keeping staff walked in to the room never clean properly when you ask front desk staff they never bring you or guide you properly only commenting from behind the desk and the rest we look for our self concierge hardly behind the counter always have to look for them as they are all busy with the mobile phones as most of the staff
