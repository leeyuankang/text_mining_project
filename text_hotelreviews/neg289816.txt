i don t think that for a family of four adults children the sofa bed was big enough for adults having a boy and girl we let the kids have the amazing twin beds but our sofa bed could of been larger i understand this is more of an executive hotel but like me i m sure other families love the central location maybe more proper family rooms in such a great hotel would get further trade
