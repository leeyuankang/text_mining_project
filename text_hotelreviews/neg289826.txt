what i did not like is the un clarity of the rooms category i was booking two rooms category under two different name deluxe room and standard room in which we paid more for the deluxe room at the end i found that both rooms are exactly the same the rooms number were deluxe and standard when i checked with the hotel reception they claimed that they offered us a big standard which i don t understand next time if i come i will book standard room instead of deluxe room and i will ask the reception to give me a big standard room so i will end up with a deluxe room i would appreciate a clarification
