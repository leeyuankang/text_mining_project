i did not get the required room i have asked for since i was travailing with my kids they asked me to move to another room and asked for an additional euros for an extra bed even though i have pre booked a room with a sofa bed after complaining to booking about this they have sorted it out and and fulfilled my requirements but in order to do that i had to wait hours in the lobby after a long trip just to get my room i was tired and imagine how the kids are the manager was not friendly at all if she is the manager she is a tall dark skin lady with a messy hair
