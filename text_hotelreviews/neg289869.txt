it was our second time stay in the hotel the meal in the grill restuarant served did not meet our requirement we had guests over and do not eat bacon pork we asked for club sandwich with chicken whereas they served us sandwich with bacon which was very disappointing they should have given us the meal as complimentary and not charged us at all for the whole meal
