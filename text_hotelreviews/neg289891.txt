stayed for nights fire alarm went off twice i get out the room and asked cleaning lady out side the hall if everything is alright she said nothing to worry about but since it didn t turn off we went quickly outside the hotel through emergency exit to find out all residents had been evacuated the other time we were ready we were on alert since then and put all our belonging ready for any fire alarm in the future no body gave us any clear explanation about it yet
