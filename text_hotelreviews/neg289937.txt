the lady in the check in desk was little bit rude in the beginning she was speaking loudly but then she said that she can t hear me i think she was trying to cover up as she really looks upset that time she was also trying to convince me to go for a bigger room which i don t want since i got a beautiful interconnecting rooms overlooking oxford street other staff were really kind and helpful
