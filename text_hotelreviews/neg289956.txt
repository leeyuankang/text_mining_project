the water was scalding hot in the shower it took minutes fiddling with the temps to get it any bit cooled down and had to have some water coming out the bath and shower at the same time to cool the water down the milk in the fridge was sour and the staff at the desk were not very friendly on arrival or departure shame because i will be visiting london a lot in the future and was hoping the amba would be a regular stop for me but not any more unfortunately
