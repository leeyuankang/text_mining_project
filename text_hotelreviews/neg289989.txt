the king bed is not confirtable as it was contained of if sungle mattresses you can t sleep in the middle as the mattress will split and you will find your self sleeping in between them so i had to sleep in the side of the bed it was really very very annoying i complained to the hotel but they saied this id how they have the double bed so next time i would refer booking a queen bed hoping the mattress come in one piece
