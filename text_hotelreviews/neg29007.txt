the have major issues with their elevator lift seems they are more interested in playing the user error game than actually looking into the problem their system does not operate smoothly and sometimes not at all even following their exact instructions the elevator lift worked of the time considering the hotel is stories tall when you are on an upper level this can be a huge issue staff were rude when pointing out the problem there were some issues of cleanliness the rug was very dirty and the bathroom was passable the breakfast was hit and miss the plates were cooked too hot to touch more than the half cooked eggs bacon and sausage in the luke warm steam table i guess your searing hot plate was supposed to finish the cooking process however they had plenty of options besides that
