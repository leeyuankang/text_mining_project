the pilllows were lumpy and only per person plus some of the furniture in the room was a little worn fine for an overnight stay but not very comfortable for any longer the location was good but it would be a long walk to the centre of london so we had to get the train or bus each time we noticed that it stated in the hotel if you booked direct that breakfast was free we were a little disappointed as we missed this deal when we booked at booking com and the breakfast would have been lovely
