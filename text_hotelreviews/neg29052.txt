booked on booking com for adults and infant but we were just given a standard double for adults max not enough room for a crib thankfully sorted out by the hotel but not without me having to make an issue out of it also the website said cribs were available but they could only give a basic travel cot which isn t really practical for a month old i had advised on the booking the age of our baby and requested a crib she ended up sleeping in her pram another issue is the confirmation includes for the cost of parking but the hotel then asks you to pay for it i assumed that because it was included on my confirmation i had already paid for it but apparently not so this caused another avoidable issue on check in after a long journey
