room was a bit small for us we were three female friends and the room was a double with a camp bed pushed in we didn t mind too much as we were only staying one night but it would have been difficult if we were staying longer also although you can walk through hyde park to oxford street it is quite a distance there is only one tube line running past this hotel location and if you are unlucky as we were and the line goes down you have to spend a small fortune on taxi fares or walk not the hotels fault but worth considering
