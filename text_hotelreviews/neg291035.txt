no view expected the street side room to be have a nice city view but it wasn t and not worth the street noise our room was on lower floor i don t like paying this much for a room that doesn t have a view exercise room small we were not interested in the tram so we would of preferred being in the city center because of all of the beautiful holiday lights for this price
