whilst the staff were very friendly sometimes when booking a restaurant in the morning when we returned in the afternoon no information passed onto other staff our junior suite whilst being large could have been better designed with a separate wc from the bathroom a lot nicer having the wc in the bathroom for example location is near to the museum area but unfortunately there are no good restaurants in this area so we had to go to the centre of vienna
