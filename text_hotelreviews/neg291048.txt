there should not be a charge for bottled water in such a nice hotel also we mentioned that we were celebrating our anniversary and there was no acknowledgement whereas in both hotels where we stayed in berlin and prague upon arrival we found a special acknowledgement in our room with champagne plus along with a card it was a lovely surprise
