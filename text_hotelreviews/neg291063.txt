the hotel staff doesn t meet any requirements of star hotel besides minor shortcomings like bad timing waiting for an ice for minutes which according to hotel s booklet should be delivered instantly the greatest dissapointment was the neglect by reception to send a porter to help me to descend almost kilos of luggage upon my departure moreover the administration simply forgot to give me the letter with important documents that came by dhl to the hotel days before my departure as i got known about this at the airport where was no possibility to receive it i kindly asked to send it back to the indicated address but unfortunately it didn t arrive therefore i have to restore it right now
