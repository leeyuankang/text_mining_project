the indoor pool water were too cold for us we ve tried in different days and hours and could not let ourselves in very cold we choose that hotel only for its indoor pool at the end we stayed the nights without using it if we new that cold water issue from advance we would rather book another hotel near the ring in half the price we don t blame the hotel for that we ve been in many hotels where the water were warmer and assumed it ll be the same here we were wrong
