the bar s smoking area was candlelit golden and mirrored totally lovely but the non smoking area was over lit unwelcoming and totally lacking in any atmosphere we also forgot to sign the chitty and a grumpy barman who clearly disapproved of our failings had to chase us down the corridor we nearly didn t bother a second time but braved the smoke on our second visit met a happier and altogether welcoming barman and had a much better experience
