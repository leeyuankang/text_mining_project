recomendation from concierge for dinner was misleading and disappointing but i was too polite to say so afterwards it required a min taxi journey each way and a cost of euro in total we subsequently found a far superior restaurant the next day in the same price range via trip advisor i feel for a star establishment this kind of misdirection is disappointing and i feel the concierge may have had alterior motives sending us out to the suburbs or had a family connection to this restaurant
