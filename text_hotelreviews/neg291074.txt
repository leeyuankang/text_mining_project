one of the reason we booked this hotel is because they had a lady spa as advertised in the booking site however when we asked at reception no one in reception believed there is such a thing i emailed the hotel and they said that they renovated their spa area last summer and they built an additional relaxing room instead of the ladies spa we were so disappointed that this was not updated on the booking site
