the man at the reception never smiles he wasn t welcoming at all don t understand why this hotel is in vienna we stayed at junior suite and the room was okay but i would choose a better one next time they let us check out late but then the card key they gave us didn t work after noon so we had problems using the elevator and even entering the room so we ended up trying three different keys and of course we had to go all the way to the reception to change the keys the worst part happened when we were in the room packing and it was before the check out time a staff knocked twice or so and just barged into our room and asked if she could check the minibar seriously the worst experience ever
