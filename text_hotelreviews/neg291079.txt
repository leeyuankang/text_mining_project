this was my visit to this hotel i ve strictly selected twin bed room since it was available on booking com when i arrived to the hotel they said thay only have queen bed room with really small bed not suitable for two feet tall men we kindly asked to upgrade to higher category if available but the claimed there is no other room available i opened booking com and saw there is master suite available for selected dates at higher price and asked them if i could upgrade they still refused to do it telling they are full booked so i just booked that another room via booking com while i was there in the hotel i got confirmation from booking com and they had no option but to sell us that room i just could not believe they are not interested to sell more expensive room even after we told them we cannot sleep on such a small bed that we initially got after we left the hotel they decided to charge us for both rooms even we did not use the first one with the small bed really bad experience that i would never expected from the hotel of that category i have a feeling they don t have enough personal to keep the hotel at high level also main meals can be ordered to room only until pm so if you are hungry at pm you cannot get anything but salads and a desert air conditioner was too loud we could not sleep with it turned on when set to automatically it just turns on and off every minute like crazy
