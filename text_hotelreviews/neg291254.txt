i had a corner room from the yard side that was not a problem for me as i was the whole day outside but is not really bright inside the fact that the hotel offers room service but the room doesn t make you feel nice staying in it s a bit problematic really small pool i mean it s nice to be able to go to the roof top and drink something but the pool is more like to wet your legs you cannot swim
