the reception guy is not very friendly while the lady was better and when we tried to use the safe box and asked whether it is charged we were told to pay euro for that later when i checked on the booking web that it should be free i called again and i asked whether it is just for deposit answer is yes is that too confusing and the room is a bit small there is no kettle tea or coffee pack swimming pool is tiny on the top of the building it is really not worth the money paid
