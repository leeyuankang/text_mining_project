having travelled to six continents of the world i have never stayed in a hotel that didnt provided a kettle unless staying in a premier room i would rather have done without toiletries at a cost of with no breakfast kettle airport shuttle and a brick wall view curtain were closed on entering the room and remained so during our stay hotel was over priced such a pity as i have friends waiting to hear of my experience so they can visit this summer this break was a surprise for my husband on our wedding anniversery however laura kept the room spotless thank you laura
