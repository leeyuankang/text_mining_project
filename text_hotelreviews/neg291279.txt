the worse customer service of my life they treat me like a criminal since the minute i made the reservation because i used the wrong card by accident and when i corrected the mistake they still treat me very poorly and demanding the food in the restaurant buffet is discussing dont try it for you can have a very luxurious breakfast in passaig de gracia in a lovely terrace the food was raw and cold overall i will not repeat and i certainly do not recommend it
