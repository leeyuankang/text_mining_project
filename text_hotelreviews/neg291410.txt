the staff could have been friendlier didn t feel like they were very welcoming when we asked questions i also found the staff in the lobby to be standoffish and not as helpful as you would expect from a hotel like this elevator was broken when we stayed so there was only elevator to use for all the rooms in the hotel this was an annoyance but not a huge problem
