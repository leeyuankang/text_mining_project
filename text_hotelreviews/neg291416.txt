the washbasin is in the room the commode is in a tiny sealed off area and you have to open the door come out and wash your hands this made me very uncomfortable not to mention it disturbed the other person in the room if you needed to use the basin while they were sleeping also the shower area does not have a door so i had to switch off the air conditioning while having a bath this also becomes inconvenient to other guests in the room i had cold pressed fruit and vegetable juices in novotel madrid petite palace boqueria also offered the same i was disappointed to be offered mostly packed juice or cava for breakfast
