i booked a table in advance at the guest relation for the two of us in the restaurant of the hotel and asked for a five course vegetarian menu which was confirmed at arrival we checked in and went almost straight to have dinner nobody seemed to know anything about our reservation and definatly not about the vegetarian whish we were told that it s not possible to have a course veggie menu in that restaurant so we left not a real good start in that hotel and a bit of a shame for the restaurant crew there was just other table so they would have had the time to be creative if they wanted to the breakfast was good but the crew always seemed to be kind of scared of the breakfast boss they were no able to take choices by us they allways had to ask him which produced a kind of nervous atmosphere
