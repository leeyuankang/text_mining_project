as vegetarians we didn t find it great for food the breakfasts were very fresh with juices and fruits pastries etc but i would have preferred a better selection of veggies unfortunately the restaurant couldn t offer us anything from the tasting menu for dinner either there are plenty of veggie restaurants within walking distance so we didn t starve
