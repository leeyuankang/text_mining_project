we enjoyed the stay but it was nothing stand out the decor is very simple with plain colours and a minimalist feel also it felt quite formal and not quite our type of place with all the staff being extremely polite and other guests lounging by the pool taking selfies of themselves obviously not a fault of the hotel but we probably wouldn t stay again in preference of a more lively casual place
