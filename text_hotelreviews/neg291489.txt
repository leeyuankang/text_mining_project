only two minor issues none of which would deter us from going back to this hotel the coffee in the rooms and the food at the sky bar it would have been nice to see a nespresso machine in the room instead of the the instant nescafe sachets really not up to par for a star hotel at the sky bar we orders a club sandwich i think we paid euros for it and it was a total disappointment again we would gladly go back to this hotel
