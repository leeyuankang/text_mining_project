too many slip ups to ignore the first hours there were two that i reviewed already and were solved by management surprise on check in and undercooked burger and i though that would be fine and they were settled but then the list kept on growing with small things that a property that rates itself as star cannot left ignored failing to organize the surprise on check in as i came minutes earlier no black out curtains in room making it almost impossible to get proper sleep cleaning staff making so much noise in the hallway although we have a do not disturb sign on the door ordering eggs that are well done from the kitchen but having them come back twice watery then a third time to come back looking like charcoal ordering a well done burger coming back medium not once but twice and waiting more than hours for the correct order kitchen has issues ordering a taxi from reception on departure and having to remind them again minutes later only to realize they didn t even order the cab while they clearly knew we needed to be on the way to airport asap requesting for an additional hour for check out when all of these issues had been happening since the start of our stay and having to have an argument with reception to get the extra hour management response was swift and prompt but with so many issues on the front line this will no doubt impact and cause negative reviews i hope you take my comments with the seriousness and action they deserve you need to either upgrade the capability of your staff or get new ones mainly in kitchen and front office
