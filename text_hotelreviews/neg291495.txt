only small hiccup was that we were placed in a family suite which was two rooms next to each other one deluxe twin and one junior suite sharing a common outer door to the hallway when we arrived the internal doors to each room were deactivated so that we only had to use the keycard for the exterior door this worked well except that housekeeping kept leaving that door open when we were out thus ensuring that anyone in theory could enter our rooms without keycards we did point this out to reception but it didn t help housekeeping did it anyway it is a very small thing and had no ill consequences just a detail that needs to be ironed out
