only two slips happened i had requested for a surprise on check in as i wanted to surprise my wife with a romantic package on check in issue is we arrived a bit earlier minutes so nothing had been prepared in the room the second is in the rooftop bar when we ordered a well done burger the burger came after minutes medium cooked then they ordered another one and had us wait another minutes only to find it again cooked medium red inside at this point we were extremely hungry and the staff basically said the kitchen got it wrong twice and if we would like to wait another minutes total wait over hours for a well done burger or cancel the order this obviously wasn t the response needed as we were very hungry and no immediate solution javier stepped in and offered an apology and gave us alternative solutions which was great
