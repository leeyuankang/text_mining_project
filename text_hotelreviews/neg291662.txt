breakfast on our last was unfortunately a disaster cold toast dumped on a plate no butter my wife s meal came out first and was suppose to have duck egg but was chicken my meal had been forgotten and by the time it came out my wife had finished although it came out late it was well cooked and well presented it was an unfortunate finish to what otherwise had been a great not good great experience in the restaurant on the previous days
