the weekend live music performances thursday to saturday at the bar restaurant area are quite loud the space is small and the volume too high we had to go elsewhere for dinner on our last night because of the noise the restaurant changes its menu every three days which is the average length of a weekend getaway thus you end up having the same menu every night fortunately there are plenty of restaurants in the area to chose from
