traveled in february the room and the lobby are extremely hot and stuffy very uncomfortable to sleep at night asked if there is a way to put air or fan on was told that no air and no fan can be put on at this time the front desk suggested i keep the window open which is a ridiculous comment since the window has no screen and keeping the window open and drapes closed would not help the situation very uncomfortable at night
