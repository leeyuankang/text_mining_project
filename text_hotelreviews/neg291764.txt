the room was far too warm and i had to keep the window open in november at night in order to be able to sleep the a c was not working and after asking i was informed that the hotel switches it off in the cold season however when the unusually warm weather makes the temperature in the rooms uncomfortable they should put the a c back on another issue is that i could clearly hear some noise from the elevator engine every time it was used apart from that the room was rather quiet
