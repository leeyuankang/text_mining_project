it would have been nice to be able to get some food on the roof top terrace the breakfast was very overpriced more people would take advantage if it was less expensive i thought the weak link at this hotel was the staff our housekeeper actually hung up a dirty towel on the floor instead of leaving us a clean one twice we asked for a restaurant recommendation the first time they sent us to a restaurant that wasn t where they said it was they marked it on a map we never found it the second time we wanted paella and they sent us to a restaurant that doesn t serve it and last we were heading to the airport and i was low on euros and told the front desk that we needed a cab that could process a cc she assured me that all cabs in barcelona took cards we got to the airport and found out that ours didn t and we didn t have enough cash to pay her
