the room was quite small and i was with my mum so we had twin beds which was in fact single beds pushed together i pushed them apart them a bit but there wasn t much space i don t like sleeping in a single bed in the uk i think you would get small double beds in a twin room and they would be separated also the weather was unusually warm but i couldn t put the aircon on because it s switched off centrally for the winter so it was very hot and too noisy to sleep with the windows open though with them closed the noise was almost completely cut out those are my only complaints
