i felt the hotel breakfast selection was excellent but i was disappointed when my wife and i ate dinner there the portion sizes were too small and not good value on the sunday nigh dinner there was a restricted number of starters and only one dessert available if i had been informed of this i would not have eaten there i was extremely disappointed with this lack of choice
