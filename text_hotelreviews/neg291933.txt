our cash was stolen from the closed safe of our room although a door blocker that wasn t there hours before clearly indicated that somebody entered the room during our absence and the safe code had been altered the hotel manager remains adamant about the fact that it would be impossible waiving any responsibility for the theft with system records showing that only our own keycards had been used to open the door and arguing that only himself the housekeeper and the maintenance manager know the universal code to open room safes bottom line he is up till today insinuating that we would be lying but is himself na ve enough to believe that burglars don t know how to open doors without keys and that no one of the above mentioned managers could have inadvertently revealed the universal safe code to other staff members as actually did the maintenance manager when he used that code as we were ourselves watching up till today the axel group direction doesn t even appreciate that minimum goodwill compensations would be appropriate they are so actively hetero friendly that lgtb eventually are becoming the minority probably due to ambiguous marketing communication deliberately fooling the lgtb community in favour of an obvious need for urgent return on investment the water of the pool was disgusting so full of mucus semen and whatever that one could not even see the bottom no wardrobe in the rooms which obviously have not been designed to accommodate more than a one night stand or a quickie the open bathroom may be design but not functional at all it s indeed not easy to shave when the mirror isn t hanging in front of the bathroom sink but perpendicular to it and you got only two small hooks to hang wet towels
