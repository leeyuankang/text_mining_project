the guest guide in the room stated that we could call for euro adapters for electronics and they would be delivered to the room the female staff at the front desk said yes we have them and to come and get them when i went down to get them she discovered that there were none in the drawer told me to go out and purchase them myself and she pointed a direction out the front door clearly she is in the wrong industry the ac in the room was poor hot and no air movement i asked about the availability of a fan she only said that maintenance would come and they did maintenance guy spanish speaking only was pleasant the filter was clogged with a thick layer of dust dirt really gross see photo he also discovered that the venting was leaking air and came back with aluminum tape to seal it up and i am assuming a clean filter the room appeared clean but the air we were breathing was being sucked thru an inch of dead skin cells and dirt ick i was starting to feel that this was a sub standard hotel and i brought my partner back down with me to discuss with that woman as he is fluent in spanish and she was a little argumentative and dismissive after arguing with her in the lobby lots of people looking on she called the manager who arrived several minutes later he was pleasant and they credited us our breakfast big deal we would not have been able to eat it as we were leaving at and offered an amazing discount would have been more appropriate and two free drinks we went up to the pool deck for the drink and the female who was arguing with us at the front desk was up there having a drink not sure if it was alcohol or not thankfully she left shortly after we arrived shade canopy for the pool bar was broken and the only umbrella up there was being used to shade the bartender from the intense direct sun great views of the neighbors hanging laundry
