this was my second time expectations were high but i must admit there was disappointmemt the staff was less enthusiastic the check in was ok but not overwhelming had to wait it was pm the staff give me the posibility of an upgrade but i had to pay extra strange because the first time i stayed i got a free upgrade so why pay now at the check out there was a formal lady she did not asked if i enjoyed my stay the first rule a customer need to smile his hotel when he leaves the hotel this time i missed it please improve be better be the best
