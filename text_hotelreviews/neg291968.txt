swimming pool is not really a pool being x meters parking is per day although i did not use it and after pm there is free parking meters from hotel but i had to find it out myself they let me use the front parking for short minute intervals and i thank them for it i got a upgraded premium room which was nevertheless disappointing because of the following low pressure shower pillows from poor quality mattress is hard shower is transparent so not ideal for friends staying in same room
