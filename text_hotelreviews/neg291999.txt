so the photos on booking com looked great modern rooms nice pool with pink loungers maybe should have set off alarm bell but did not the only problem was that no where did booking com mention that this was a gay hotel the lobby and rooms are full of images of half naked men and there is even a please disturb sign you can hang on the door of you are looking for a bit of surprise man on man action one can even get fed breakfast in bed or a hands guy male massage if wanted according to the big advert at the lifts jesus my girlfriend and i did not mind that it was predominantly a hetrofriendly gay hotel and actually found it hilarious but i can t imagine everyone would be so comfortable the fact that their is a no refunds policy i do think booking com is misleading on this one
