the receptionist was rude when we tried to check in one hour after check in time he spoke to us as if it wasn t his problem that the room wasn t ready and after offering a free drink didn t follow up with the offer any receptionist in these circumstances should be apologetic to customers a second receptionist was nice and told us we would be upgraded for no extra charge but the room didn t seem to be much different to the one we had paid for the room was nice and modern but had little to no storage for clothiers
