i booked the highest rate room which suppose to have a bigger french windows that are shown in the photos that they stretch across to the corner of the room indoor veranda what was given to us was the room that is one level lower we complaint later and then they said they made a mistake and that they will offer us breakfast instead to make up for the extra charge and the mistake they did basically they made a mistake and we had to pay for it by letting us pay for breakfast that we didn t want or need in the first place what they should have done is offer us a free breakfast and refunded us for the extra change of the room type we paid for and never got other things were with the hotel was super hot no ac in common areas the room was very hot for hours after we have checked in as the ac will only go on after you insert the room key into the room key slot the closet is just a rack and no tea or coffee machine in the room i have noticed this about gay hotels is that they take pink dollar for granted and offer the minimal as premium while you can get these things in a star hotel that is not gay the only thing about this hotel is that it s gay theme look and people who go there and that s it nothing special about it at all the pool and gym are very tiny that is silly to call them facilities sorry
