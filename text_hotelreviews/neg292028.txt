we had higher expectations for the rooms as they looked great in the pictures online but when arriving the room felt quite empty and not as opulent as what we would have expected from a hotel also certain amenities such as complimentary water and coffee in the room was not offered by the hotel we also asked for an iron and board and the unit that was supplied spewed water all over the place yes this is replaceable but in a establishment these should have been checked guests shouldn t have to request another one it s the small details like this that will put us off staying at the hotel again
