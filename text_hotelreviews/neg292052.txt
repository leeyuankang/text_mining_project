my holiday was ruined when i caught my car on the wall when trying to get out of the parking large cars cannot get round the bends in one go guests should be told the parking is not suitable for large cars both reception staff said it is very difficult to park a large car but did not offer to help it has become a very expensive stay it also cost euros per night i also felt uncomfortable with the type of hotel this is it would help to warn potential guests
