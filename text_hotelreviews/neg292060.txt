we were expecting more for that price we got a superior deluxe room and it didn t even have a coffe machine or just a cattle to boil water maybe only in our room we didn t find out actually i wonder what besides the price was the difference between normal room and this superior deluxe one quality of furniture wasn t the best some drawers was not working properly and wifi code works only for devices which was hard to deal with cause we had phones and ipads
