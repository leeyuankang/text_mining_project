this hotel has definitely worst and the most tricky staff ever i booked a superior room they gave me a double the one above was deluxe when i realised the situation they insist lying and told me the room i ve been given is a superior room until i wanted to see a double and a deluxe room to compare they chanced my room after a long discussion and offer me euros refund i accepted it when i check out i realised they hidden the euros refunded amount to my extras when i asked what is it they told me it was tax i realised they were lying again didn t pay that amount be careful if you stay there
