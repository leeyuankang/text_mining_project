checking in was really complicated my stay here was a present from someone else and they booked and prepaid using their credit card but when i tried to check in myself the staff told me they needed to see the credit card used to make the booking or they wouldn t let me check in of course i did not have the card so i had to contact my friend and he had to send them photos of the card didn t matter that the booking was already paid for and it had my name on it this means in this hotel you can only book a room for yourself you cannot book for anyone else because then it will be too difficult when they try to check in also after i checked in when they gave me the key it was for a room that already belonged to someone else someone else was already using that room i went in and all their suitcases and things were in there and the room smelled of cigarettes i had to go back to reception and tell them and then they gave me another room that wasn t already being used i know this is a new hotel but still stuff like this shouldn t happen in this hotel the restaurant only does breakfast the advertising you can see everywhere like in your room and the lift etc they say how amazing it is but actually it s not especially because the food is not fresh i ate some fruit there for example some watermelon and it was already sour like it was a few days old already i told the staff and they just brought it back to kitchen didn t explain or apologise or anything i felt this was unprofessional
