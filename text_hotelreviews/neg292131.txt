we arrived at the hotel earlier than the checkin time and were advised that we can just check in later we specifically requested for a double bed and had been told that we will get one when we came back another staff called david gave us a twin room and refused to acknowledge our earlier request stating that the hotel is fully booked good thing mark was there and he helped us sort out our room otherwise we would have been miserable for the nights we were staying there
