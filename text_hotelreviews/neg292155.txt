poor value for money not good enough location or enough facilities or inclusions to justify the charges small room could hardly take my bag advertised gym and spa doesn t yet exist pool and rooftop bar area disappointing poor bar staff with zero care factor reception staff charged my card in the wrong currency and without authorisation very poor business practice i could go on i wouldn t recommend this hotel there is much better around at half the price
