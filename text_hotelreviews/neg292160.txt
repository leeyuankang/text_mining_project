the hotel is a normal hotel with pictures of men in the front windows nothing else makes it gay these pictures are too graphic and i was embarrassed to see the reactions of children walking past there is no spa only a swimming pool they play music constantly throughout day and night and it doesn t need to be played on bedroom floors room too cold even though i turned off aircon why only a thin bedsheet as a cover
