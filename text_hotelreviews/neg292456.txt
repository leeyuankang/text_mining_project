the shower was broken no cold water only mild or hot had no time to ask for fixing or change a room as we were very tired the hotel is min at night min at day by bus from city center av para lel up to min if traffic jams are on the main road to barcelona the area is industrial so nowhere to go it is only suitable if you need a short stay near barcelona airport or port it is a business purposed i do not suggest it for leisure stay taxi price still high because minimum charge to airport still eur
