the location is very bad industrial area the rooms are small and do not look like what is advertised on the internet the beds were like hospital beds and although i sent my requirements to the hotel well in advance the room was not very nice and i had to request a change of room which could only be done the next day the only person that assisted was david at reception but certainly not a very nice hotel for the rates that they requested towels had holes in it and were thread bare bathroom was not neat and clean advise all to avoid this hotel at all costs
