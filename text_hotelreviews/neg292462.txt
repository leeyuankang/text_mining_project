if this hotel wasn t where it was and have the weekend transportation issues as during the week it is hopping with huge trucks going about their business it would be an excellent hotel the hotel is in the industrial commons next to a frozen food packing company and some other factory packing plant businesses the surroundings were just very industrial not exactly picturesque there were nice mountain biking paths by the river if you had the gear for that sort of thing it may have been nice the area of the city is deserted on the weekend going to the newly built metro and being the only person there was a little unsettling especially since the metro came less frequently to boot then a regional train was needed to get into the city center it was ticks on my multipass metro ticket each way and it was about an hour s journey i took the bus into the city the next day it only comes every half an hour on weekends so look up the time beforehand it takes only about a half an hour to get to the port then a minute walk to the para lel metro stop not bad but on the way back to the hotel the driver was giving another group of drivers who had just gotten off work a ride to their cars which i assume were parked at the end stop of the line the driver didn t stop at the stop for the hotel and drove over the river to the next stop i had to walk back over the river to th hotel navigating an industrial round about and figuring out which side of the bridge was open to pedestrian traffic since there was no shade on the route i was a melting puddle of perspiration upon returning to the hotel if they warned about these transportation issues beforehand and maybe gave a business card to give to the bus driver for the return journey i think that i would not have been so peeved i told the lady at the counter what had happened and she said it had happened to her before too because the drivers get to talking and don t pay attention
