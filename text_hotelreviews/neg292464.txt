the location and staff were horrible the hotel was hard to find and in an industrial area no restaurants shops etc the staff basically the reservations person esther was rude and downright insulting i ended up paying for a room because i made an error in my reservation which i attempted unsuccessfully to correct minutes later definitely not recommended
