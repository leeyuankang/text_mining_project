the only issue that i might have is that the hotel is situated quite a distance away from the main city centre of barcelona however the public transport to and from the hotel is easily accessible the bus stop is literally just metres or so from the hotel and a short walk of about takes you to the metro subway station which connects to the main subway network the hotel staff at the main desk are ever willing to assist guests should you have any questions on the timings of the buses
