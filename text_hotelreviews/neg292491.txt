i didn t enjoy my stay what so ever here we landed at the airport and they gave me a number to ring this number wasn t recognised we couldn t find a shuttle bus to the hotel no one knew which shuttle bus we needed to look out for and nothing was stated on the website also this states it is a hotel airport when clearly it isn t as its mins away we had breakfast included which didn t state continental breakfast the breakfast was awful and cold and the waitress wasn t very happy we ordered the shuttle bus and it only goes every minutes we was the only ones on the shuttle bus who wanted the shuttle bus service the driver wouldnt leave till the actual time of departure baring in mind that our flight was in hours so left us sitting around and he didn t even greet us check out was very slow and and the driver took us to before which is where we needed to get our flight the swimming pool was freezing and very small it doesn t state the size of the pool on the hotel description
