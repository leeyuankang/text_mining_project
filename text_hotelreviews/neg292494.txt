restaurant and buffet were not the best to put it nicely definitely eat the food at the bar we chose this hotel because of it s non smoking rooms when i booked i even added a special note making sure these were non smoking rooms we booked rooms with this special request when we got there of our rooms were great and smelt horribly of smoke we addressed this with the front desk they sent someone up to smell and she told us it did not smell of smoke and it was a matter of opinion we asked several times to switch rooms or for a discounted rate as we would not be using the room and instead sleeping on the floor of one of our other rooms we had booked but they were extremely rude and not accommodating at all she continued to say it s a matter of opinion in fact she mentioned she smokes and so she would know how it smells lol what a joke after several workers came to smell and a pretty heated argument they finally switched us to another room my question is why didn t they switch at the first complaint we are all still baffled at that the customer is always right but to them their opinion and sense of smell was greater than ours night crew was very condescending and rude
