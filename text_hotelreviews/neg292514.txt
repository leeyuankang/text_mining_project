the water is not hot when taking a shower and we went to the counter twice to reply this problem the staff said because of the new year he could not fix the problem and all the rooms in hotel were full he couldn t change the room for us at the first time when we told him it s too cold to take a shower so the second time he gave us an empty room to take shower it s really awful that he lied that there was no solution at the beginning
