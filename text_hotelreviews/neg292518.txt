the hotel is near the airport but in an industrial area nothing of interest in the vicinity so one just goes there to sleep breakfast buffet was pretty good but service terrible one lone staffer couldn t keep up with attending to the dining area although not that many of us there at that time he spent more time in the kitchen than in the dining room so maybe they were short staffed there also
