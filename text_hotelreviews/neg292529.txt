where to start first room i was assigned had a horrid sewage smell that hit me as soon as i opened the door changed rooms to one on the floor advertised as having ac but apparently it is turned off starting november even tho it is still hot outside room was very warm so asked to move to lower hopefully cooler floor got one on the floor which seemed great until am when the noxious smell of cigarette smoke started blowing into my room from who know s where this is supposed to be a non smoking hotel but as seems to be typical in europe that little detail seems to be willfully ignored it was awful needless to say my one night there could have been better the front desk personnel were very helpful and accommodating and none of the issues were their fault
