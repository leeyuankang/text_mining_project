what we did not like about our stay was the strobe like effect of a faulty light in the bathroom when we turned the light off it strobed every few seconds like a flashlight on automatic so we decided to sleep with the bathroom light on instead not ideal because we like to sleep in the dark we told reception staff next morning to save future guests suffering the same problem the staff were unconcerned no apology no offer of part refund or anything they did not even ask which of the four bathroom lights was the problem or ask for more details of its manifestation they just said they would report it to maintenance
