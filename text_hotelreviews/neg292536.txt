the location is impossible very unpleasant in a desolated industrial area and quite far even taxi drivers using gps had hard time finding how to get there it is certainly not minuted from the airport and if you try to get there with your own car you may get lost the hotel shuttle went minutes in a very complicated way the rooms were ok but nothing to write home about very bad sound proof we practically heard what other people say in the next room and the corridor let alone people coughing or children s crying the light is unpleasant bathroom is somehow sophisticated but not so nicely maintained water came simultaneously from the rainfall and telephone taps food is ok but breakfast area is small and in the morning a bit crowded so that if you are in a hurry to leave you can t wait for refills and so are the tiny two lifts that can carry very little luggage people at once so that you end up waiting long to get the lift in total is is not worthy the more than e including breakfast per night
