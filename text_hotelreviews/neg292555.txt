definitely not a i would rate it as for spain the location is horrible it is an industrial area surrounded only with trucks and factories the subway is quite far the bus takes you only close to the centre taxi costed euros till the centre of barcelona the swimming pool and sauna was horrible could not even rate as star not heated this hotel is good only for one night sleep and fly if you want to enjoy pool or see something in barcelona at list go out for dinner i do not recommend does not worse to save on shuttle
