a bit disappointed that they had no facilities for children something like a football table would have been great for kids also the fact that there were no tea or coffee in the room if they don t have free coffee and tea in the rooms then i thought customers should have warm drinks on their first night and maybe last nights free here we had no warm drinks free i had to pay for warm drinks the night we arrived otherwise i think its a lovely hotel
