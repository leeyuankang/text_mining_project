we walked to the hotel and there were virtually no sign of the premises until we walked in the door street signs would be a good idea when we were dropped at the airport we were actually asked to get out of the bus quite some distance from the entrance quite confusing as all communication was in spanish even though at least half the bus was filled with english speakers i also felt it was fairly expensive for what we got compared to all the other accommodation we had used in spain
