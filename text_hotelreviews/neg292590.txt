as mentioned in previous reviews there is nothing around the hotel except industrial trans shipment facilities eat at the hotel or at the airport before you take the shuttle do not attempt the metro it s expensive and drops you in the middle of no where it turns out it s probably only a walk to the hotel if you know the way but two calls to the hotel didn t help us figure it out and we walked about twice that far over cobblestones pulling bags in sweltering heat
