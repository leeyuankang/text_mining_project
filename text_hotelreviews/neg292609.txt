we arrived at barcelona around and thus booked this hotel hoping the airport shuttle bus can pick us up conveniently i called the hotel in the morning to query about the shuttle bus and the lady told me i just need to ring them once i landed me my boyfriend and another guy tried to call them since but the line was always busy until the shuttle bus finally came but for the past at middle night no one from hotel picked up the call and we were really depressed as we didn t know if the shuttle bus is gonna come
