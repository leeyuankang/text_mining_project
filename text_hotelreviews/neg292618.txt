i was disappointed to have to pay a taxi driver to get there from airport when a free shuttle bus was available i wanted to contact the hotel via email before my trip to find location of bus but no email address could be found calling the hotel and looking for directions on arrival i feel is unfair to the paying consumer when you take into account extra charges on calls euro credit in my phone went while talking to the receptionist who couldn t direct me to the bus
