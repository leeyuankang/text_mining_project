the location of this hotel was an absolute nightmare first of all the room was incredibly hot with no ability to adjust the thermostat as it is set by the hotel staff we had to open all of the windows in order to be able to get any cool air into the room this hotel is set in an industrial area with nothing around but warehouses and our room faced the main road and intersection where trucks were stopping and going literally throughout the entire night one after another we would hear the loud noises of truck brakes squealing at a red light idling and then the rumbling of them starting up again when the light turned green we re all pretty heavy sleepers and can handle noise but this kept us up for hours until we all put headphones on to dull out the sounds
