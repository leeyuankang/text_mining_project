the price for breakfast or anything from the restaurant or convenience shop was extortionate i had a rate booked for me that was meant to include breakfast but it turns out that in the fine print it said the rate was only available for cruise ship passengers apparently the hotel values cruise ship passengers more than airport passengers because they not only told me that i would have to pay for breakfast fair enough i guess they did so in a loud manner that made it appear to all the people around that i was purposefully trying to mooch free breakfast off them finally although the hotel markets itself as being an airport hotel it was a euro taxi ride from the airport after waiting unsuccessfully for the hotel shuttle to pick us up for more than an hour
