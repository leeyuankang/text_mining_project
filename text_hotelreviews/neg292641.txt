the place is in the middle of nowhere if you are hungry be ready to spend more than hotel price is i had very bad experience about it and it is the first time i am writing any survey restaurant opens just at pm i ve arrived at till that time there is caffee where you can eat smth i have ordered pizza price eur pizza was very very very small and too over cooked so i didn t eat it of course they didn t take money as soon as restaurant opened i went there but food was very very very bad and despite this i ate it i was starving and after i ate everything all night i spent in the toilet while voming i told them but they said that i am just complaining that was the very first time for me with such experience and believe me i am traveling more than days per year the conclusion i will better spend my night at the airport while waiting my next flight next time
