a bit too far from the airport so you will need to take the shuttle bus i was lucky to catch it right after my arrival and it was all sorted for my departure however please stock up on water necessities before leaving the airport dinner at the restaurant only starts at and there is no supermarket nearby also no tea coffee facilities in room and my double bed was composed of two singles put together which kept going apart however the staff are really accommodating and will help you find everything you are looking for
