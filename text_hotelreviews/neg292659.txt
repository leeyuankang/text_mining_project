i am really shocked with poor management of hotel financial system i had a free cancellation booking but suprisingly days after booking the money was withrawn from my card without any perior permission upon check in the lady receptionist refused the payment and said the money has not been deposited in their account and it was only blocked i showed her the statement but she denied severla times i was really angry but could not do any thing till midnight i was trying to tell them that is their fault finally at am a new receptionist simply told me it was taken by mistake without any apollogy for this illigal action i will never recommend this hotel and would complain against them
