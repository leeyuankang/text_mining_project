this hotel has aeropuerto in its name therefore mostly geared towards passengers arriving from a flight departing next morning or both their airport shuttle should be the most important offering instead if you book a stay at this hotel there is no guarantee you re getting a shuttle ride at all they run the shuttle from the hotel to the airport on a preset schedule with minute intervals and there are only seats per ride i would strongly suggest taking this into consideration before booking this hotel as this may screw up your plans very badly the hotel itself is in a middle of a industrial area not sure if you can get a taxi to pick you up from there our reservation was breakfast included we came in and sat at a table the breakfast attendant asked us the room number which we thought was normal at the end without any explanation she handed us a bill for our breakfast which apparently we must pay now i pulled my smartphone showing our reservation on booking com clearly stating that breakfast was included instead she sent us to the receptionist to handle the bill situation at first the receptionist tried to convince me that breakfast was not included until i pulled my smartphone again then she clicked something on her computer and said it was ok and we did not have to pay for breakfast breakfast area was not air conditioned hot and muggy the food choice was minimal and of poor quality their only coffee machine was a hit or miss had to complain it did not dispense hot water attendant came in and restarted the machine if you pressed hot chocolate you got coffee if you re planning to use the indoor pool please remember that they require everyone to wear a swim cap
