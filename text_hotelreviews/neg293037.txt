the staff seemed overwhelmed and it was hard to get their attention for help also the hotel was under construction and the construction was very loud during the day plus the hotel was overrun by college students young adults who seemed to be going to the beach you could hear loud music at night and the general vibe of the hotel was very loud and chaotic also it is very close to the barcelona cathedral so there are crowds and a lot of noise in the area if you are looking for a relaxing quiet environment i don t think this is the hotel for you
