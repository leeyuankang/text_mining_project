i normally book hotels because of the service they provide i however booked this hotel based on the reviews it had received on booking com which were super positive i must say i do not think paying per night breakfast for a room at this hotel is money worth while so the reviews did not live up to my expectations you pay for the location everything else is just ok breakfast was really average it was also very time consuming to organize a taxi pick up at the airport the hotel never reverted to my initial request and i had to reach out again to them and the email i got was in bad english and very unclear as to how transportation is arranged i had to call them to sort it out the hotel collaborates with vip taxi company which is very slow in responding and clearly has no urgency to respond to client requests i ended up spending too much time on something that normally gets dealt with in an emsil i am used to better service and will next time choose a hotel that provides that
