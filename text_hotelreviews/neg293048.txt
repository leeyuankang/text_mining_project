what we absolutely didn t appreciate and felt as a complete lack of professionalism and respect being promised a taxi within that never showed up never even being told that taxis couldn t at that particular time reach the hotel which resulted in having to run almost km chase a taxi with luggages and one of us being unfit to do so because of back problems what we tought the hotel should just drop a proposal for wine and cheese tasting that results in almost only one sip of a not so dry white wine and barely a cm of cheese per person
