there was a serious water leak through the ceiling in the reception area on our second afternoon which had come from a bedroom this went on for several hours but the hotel staff gave us no information about whether the other bedrooms were safe or whether any water was travelling elsewhere above no information was displayed which could have said do not worry etc no sign of a manager just the usual very good reception staff
