there was a serious water leak in the area outside the lifts and reception on our day water was pouring through the ceiling from the first floor through the light fittings this went on for several hours but was cleaned and a temporary repair made the area was out of use for quite a time there was no information given to guests at all about whether the hotel was safe or whether part of it would be closed because of water damage there seemed to be no manager on duty to either give messages to guests or to talk to them to reassure that all was well we expect to have visible managers at times like this
