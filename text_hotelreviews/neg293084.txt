unfortunately the air conditioning never really worked except to blow out warm air it worked well throughout the rest of the building we mentioned it several times to the front desk and they assured us it would be taken care of and that it was fixed but despite being set to maximum cool it never cooled off the room leaving to our not getting a good nights sleep when i asked to be moved to another room due to my husbands emphesema i was told the hotel was completely booked this was during the annual may day holiday but our lack of a healthy sleep made our stay uncomfortable
