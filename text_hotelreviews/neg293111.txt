the rooms were extremely warm as the hotel could not turn on the ac until the winter season is officially over and that s when the central heating system will be switched to ac so we had to resort to the windows cracked open at night which meant we had to listen to the street noises until but the worst part was the incompetence of the receptionists specifically manuel who were not prepared at all to help with check out on the day of the marathon we happened to notice a discrete sign at the front desk and in the elevator that they put up the day before saying that all roads will be closed very helpful when it came to us a family of one being an elderly person of and a child of and four suitcases finally after arguing with them all afternoon at the restaurant manager offered to help us with the suitcases the next day so we could walk for a half hour around the marathon streets to get to our airport transportation we had been at the hotel for a whole week and they did not think once to tell us to prepare for this day even though they knew that my year old mother is with us an email i sent to them before checking in and that we were checking out on marathon day a yearly event which they have a whole year to plan for disappointing ending to a delightful vacation
