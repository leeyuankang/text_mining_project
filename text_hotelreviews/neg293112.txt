our stay was great but had a little issue with the temperature of the room we stayed on the hotel in early march with the high temps around f c but when we initially walked into our room it was about f c we turned off the heat but we still had to keep our window open the entire day stay so it was a little noisy at night the hotel is in a busy area with lots of noise in the street sidewalk but not sure if it would have been noisy with the window shut
