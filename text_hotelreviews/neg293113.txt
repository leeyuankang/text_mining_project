room was good but could have been sound proofed more as you could hear the neighbours toilet tank moved and banged against the wall every time toilet used i have never stayed in a hotel where only teabag coffee sachet left for each guest and milk which contained a teaspoon of milk which is why i need at least per cup one day we were left without any the air con only blew out warm air on the lowest setting so it was left off as i found the room warm i would not be able to use this hotel in the summer as i would bake a few alterations could make your stay much more enjoyable and it s all achievable brother was pick pocketed on our first night but luckily ran him down and got his wallet back amazing as he has bad knees must have been the adrenaline this happened directly outside hotel when getting in to a taxi unfortunately hotel not that interested when notified that this happened on their door step which was a bit disappointing beware they are everywhere and you can actually spot a lot of them
