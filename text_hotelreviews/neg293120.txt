we had a small issue with our room being way too hot and we found it difficult to manoeuvre the window to get some fresh air into the room it was eventually addressed and it was pretty noisy with the window open but it s the price you pay for being in the middle of a vibrant city i had some other minor issues but all were discussed and addressed to my satisfaction
