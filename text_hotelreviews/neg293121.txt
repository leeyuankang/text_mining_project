the safe in my room was tricky i had to have help which was provided immediately it worked for days but then the safe lost the code i did the reset procedure and it seemed to be locked but opened when i turned the knob the opposite direction i could not depend on it so i just carried everything with me the last days also the taxi could not drive to the hotel in the busy afternoon when i arrived so i had to find it on my own after a long flight but on leaving at the taxi arrived at the door about minutes after the call from the desk i had not yet signed my receipt
