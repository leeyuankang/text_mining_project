myself any my husband felt sorry for the waiter at breakfast every morning he was rushed off his feet looking after a number of guests alone there was a manger there but did not help once at taking an order for the duration of our breakfast room was comfortable but noisy lots of shouting in the corridor the guy at reception on check out did not even ask how was our stay just printed bill and said goodbye no interaction whatsoever paying over in january for a couple of nights is expensive and a little more customer service would have been nice
