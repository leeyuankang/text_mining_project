i don t have any complaints maybe that there wasn t many english channels on the tv but that didn t really matter cause we didn t watch much tv or that most cabs won t drop off at hotel they ask if they can drop you off in front of the cathedral but that didn t really matter to us but it s only a min walk no biggie
