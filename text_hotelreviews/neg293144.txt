the a c was off and therefore the air in the room was stale dry and too warm the management told us the a c would be off during the winter months so we would have to open the window if we wanted fresh air the problem with that is the noisy neighborhood partying through the night also during weekdays mixed with the loud garbage collectors and traffic noise making it impossible to sleep with the window open
