wifi signal was almost non existent in our room i asked the guy at the reception to check it out but it didn t help from past visits to this hotel i can say it does work in other rooms i guess it depends on the room and its distance from the router but still i would expect to get full coverage when it says wifi is available in all areas breakfast price is expensive
