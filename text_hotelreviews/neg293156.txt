on arrival after a long trip we made a cup of tea when phoning for the wifi code we requested more tea bags we had just used our allocated to the room a gentleman arrived from reception with in his hand and advised that these would incur an additional charge and be added to the bill i told him that after paying for the hotel room for days you are going to charge me for a tea bag needless to say out of principle i told him to forget it i would purchase some in a small mini market after mins he returned and advised we could keep the tea but if we ask for more we would be charged though it was the only negative as the hotel is perfectly located and comfortable it started the visit in this hotel on a bad footing
