taxi maneuvers could be a little difficult because of the location along with road closures and other city events the desk will call a cab however on a day when cabs were not so plentiful we waited over minutes for the cab to come with no luck the desk staff suggested to go out to a nearby street where there was a cab stand we re well traveled and live in cities were you hail cabs so we did that and had cab in just a minute or two on a very busy day there was another couple that couldn t walk that far so that wouldn t have been good for them
