the internet went down while i was there for the best part of a day not the hotel s fault but it affected the hotel s payment system too so checking out was a bit of a pain not sure whether this is regular occurrence or not ignore any taxi driver that tells you he has to drop you off on the main street and that you will have to lug your own suitcase for five minutes across the pedestrian area in front of the cathedral the hotel is on a side street but it is accessible by car i think my driver was just feeling lazy that day the pigeons enjoying the pool were a bit off putting plus it was too cold to swim in already in early september all rooms are non smoking but there was a large and obvious cigarette burn on the comfy chair in my room this is all minor stuff and not necessarily within the hotel s control however i think it s a fabulous hotel
