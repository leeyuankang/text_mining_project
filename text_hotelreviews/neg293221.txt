when we arrived we checked in and the room wasn t ready even though it was past check in time we waited quite a while for staff to come and deal with it this wasn t ideal as after travelling we just wanted to get changed and relax we complained and were offered a room with a king bed which we didn t want as we are two friends we had booked a twin room this wasn t any good so we said we d wait for the room to be cleaned it took a while before a member of staff offered us a seat downstairs in the bar area and a complimentary drink we went and waited around mins and nobody came to ask us what we wanted the place seemed deserted eventually we got our drinks brought up to the room but it took at least mins then we were asked to sign for them to go on the bill the message had obviously not been passed on that they were free of charge this was sorted quickly though we then asked for an iron and waited ages then a member of staff came up to inform us that there was no iron available so we couldn t have one it seemed other guests were using them so it was fair enough just a shame they didn t have more to go around initially it was a slightly disappointing start to the stay as we were expecting super service due to all the excellent reviews and the cost to stay there but after these initial problems were ironed out the rest of the stay was problem free
