ventilating system was poor and staff was slow to respond first day i made two calls to the front desk because room was hot though they said someone would come up in mins no one showed up after an uncomfortable night i stopped by the front desk system was better second night though seemed to go off during the night same for third night at nearly per night without breakfast i expect a better hvac system and more responsiveness because of the location open windows were not an option there is a lot of street noise
