my only disappointment was the fact that our hot water wasn t working probably and it took full days to fix we had to show someone from the staff what we meant there was plenty of hot water going into the bath but only cold water would flow from the rain shower it was very weird they only offered us breakfast as compensation twice we had to keep complaining we found this a bit poor otherwise the staff were helpful and knowledge
