i am so let down by this hotel as having made a simple booking mistake booking rooms instead of they coldly unkindlly and with dreadful attitude made me pay for the even though the night before they had told me they would simply cancel the third room i had booked this night as a surprise for my son it was the first time he was without his twin brother we were alone and i wanted to spoil him they did not need the room the hotel was not full so it was plain greed never again will i return
