their restaurants opening hours capellans it seems like a lovely restaurant and the hotel staff tell me the food is lovely but it only opens each day which is incredibly odd with only a handful of restaurants nearby it makes perfect sense that some people in the hotel would want to eat in the hotel restaurant of an evening when they close the restaurant at it seems incredibly short sighted by the hotel i think they re missing out on a lot of evening business
