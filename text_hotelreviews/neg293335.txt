restaurant is also very good with delicious food but has very strange working hours are exactly the time span when we don t need the hotel s restaurant cause we are strolling out in the city anyway there are a lot of restaurants nearby to get some good food at any time sound proofing is not good we heard everything from the hall much too well people from adjacent rooms could be heard too if they got louder than usual
