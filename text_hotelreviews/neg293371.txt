we were in a room next to lift it said on website sound proof rooms but we could not sleep all night people were going up and down in the lift and talking outside of the lift could be heard perfectly this is not a sound proof room we could even hear them walking sleepless night in a per night bed sorry but for all this money i expect better or i would chose a euro room somewhere else don t you think you would expect the same if it was your money please fix this or lower your prices because to be honest you are over rated as a hotel
