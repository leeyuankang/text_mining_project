avoid the restaurant steak house people in the restaurant after minutes my order was taken a fillet steak with pepper sauce the fillet steak arrived about minutes later with a mushroom and half a tomato see picture attached i asked about what was with the steak the lady replied you did not order anything i did mention the pepper sauce which did not come with the steak as i assumed that there would be some veg i then ordered chips after a further minutes and having not received my chips i went to the cashier to pay the bill the bill was given to me with a pound for the pepper sauce which i did not get and a service charge for the steak cost the waitress who was then talking to work colleagues asked me did i enjoy my meal when i explained to her that i had no time to wait for the chips and i did not want to pay the service charge she said that it was her first day at work and that she had been busy all day like her other work colleagues who were chatting with her i told her that i was also busy during the day and that i had nt eaten anything anyway they did not charge me the service charge breakfast was poor for they have a nice restaurant but they seriously need some help on customer service and quality improvements for what they serve for breakfast i would also like to point out that staff at breakfast were friendly
