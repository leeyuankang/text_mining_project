the location was okay however we were better off staying elsewhere as booking com staff said the overnight stay was we went to check out and the lady behind the till stated the same when paying for the parking ticket the fee was we spoke to the ncp staff via the intercom at the car park who stated we need to speak to holiday inn staff to get a discount applied holiday inn could not assist us as they have no association with ncp for over and a half years holiday inn then advised to complain to booking com who did not answer the phone after being on hold for minutes
