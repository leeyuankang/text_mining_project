the location is a bit confusing since the hotel is tucked away on a quiet street but i was able to get around more easily the second time i stayed because i d become familiar with the area also both stays our rooms were far from the elevator which ensured they were quiet but trudging all the way with luggage was not fun again this was because we needed early check ins so it s not the property s fault at all
