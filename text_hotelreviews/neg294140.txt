lady on check in seemed a little disinterested no extractor fan in shower room so could not use mirror shower curtain had lost a ring or two and shower room flooded each time we took a shower water did not drain from sink accommodation clean but very very tired headboards scratched and looked very untidy no plates at breakfast had to wait ages at peak time for lifts as everyone going for breakfast and one being utilised for service and others just seemed to skip floor to the extent everyone just used the stairs i stay in london a lot and this was not the greatest value for money i would assess as about the same as a premier inn travelodge which i could have booked for less
