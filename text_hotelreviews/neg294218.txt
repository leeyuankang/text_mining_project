having only staying at the hotel night it was deeply upsetting to be in part of a fire evac at midnight having a busy weekend we was already in bed and the alarm was right above our bed which gave us a fright when it started going of very late although i understand the importance of safety within the hotel the time was not convientient and all we got from the hotel was a letter slipped under the door thanking us for taking part it would of been nice to get a little extra from the hotel rather than just a thank you
