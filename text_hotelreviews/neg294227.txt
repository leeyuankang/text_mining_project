the first night of my stay i was on level i found the room way too hot and stifling i had to ring down to reception to ask for the heating to be switched off the man on reception was very pleasant and this done asap but it took a good while for the room to cool down and i was feeling unwell as it was from my journey also a couple of days before my trip i emailed holiday inn to request an earlier check in time when i arrived i was told that this email was not received but that if i paid an extra i could check in early i wasn t particularly happy about that but as i was feeling unwell i paid the extra charge just one other point the staff on reception the day i arrived sunday february were all very pleasant however it would be so helpful if at least one of them had fairly good english even just one person out of the that would make things easier after a stressful journey
