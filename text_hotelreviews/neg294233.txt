the room was really small i mean bed and table and that was it ok for just sleeping in but hardly any room to swing a cat in also the lights were pot luck when you didn t know what switch did what and the light fitting was hanging loose from the ceiling when i booked i booked for a price of per night when i checked on the day i could ve paid per night ridiculous that i couldn t get it at this rate for booking in advance
