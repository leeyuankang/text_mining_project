nothing too negative just a little thought this could be a general london vibe but this is how i felt on the weekend the hotel felt like they only served business men understandable that these men and women are very important however didn t make the tourist feel that welcome perhaps offer some help with tourist attractions recommend what would be good leaflets in the hotel rooms would good with some sort of map
