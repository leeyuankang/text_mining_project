the spa was closed and they did not tell us until we asked to use the spa they did not tell us the spa was closed before we got to the hotel when i was already communicating with them nor during check in the water in the shower constantly changed from really hot to really cold just did not live up to the hype at all the location is right next to camp not but is a way out from the beach and the city centre but not too hard to get about on the metro just not ideal
