darkish fairly small room hadn t prepared sofa bed for child had to request bit soulless not really for families looking to base themselves mostly in their hotel hard to get info on basics like when meals were where pools were etc rooftop pool deep would not be suitable for little kids good for transit excellent for nou camp imagine less so for extended young family stay
