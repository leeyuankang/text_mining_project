wasn t keen on a bar meal i had it was lukewarm and obviously microwaved very disappointing would like two pillows for my bed it would be nice if the complimentary water could be replaced when its used if you are in a room for three people it would be nice if we could have three tea cups at the outset rather than having to take one from the restaurant
