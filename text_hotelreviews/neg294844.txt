i m sure i booked king size room when got there was told could upgrade was not happy only hour limited spa time which meant only could use once as closed on mondays no reclining beds as was advertised also i had a full swim suit was questioned why i was covered so they prefer bikinis to burkini even though nine was still a swim suit
