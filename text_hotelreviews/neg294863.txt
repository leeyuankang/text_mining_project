this hotel unfortunately should be rated as a star the beds are rock hard and the rooms are very dated the wifi is terribly slow that even facebook doesn t upload we didn t use the spa so cannot comment but it is only free from which is not very convenient so that s why we couldn t use it outside these hours you have to pay i would not go back
