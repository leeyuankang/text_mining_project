there was a few maintenance problems as one of the lifts was being looking at the fountain outside was being repaired albeit briefly and then fixed the sauna was not in use and one of the jacuzzi buttons wasnt working properly a few things that needed attention but we didnt mind as the rest of it was lovely the breakfast option seemed a little pricey for what it was standard continental breakfast but was still nice
