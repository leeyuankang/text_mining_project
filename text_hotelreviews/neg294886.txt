the staff were unhelpful and dismissive the room temperatures were about degrees boiling hot you couldn t breath at reception staff were dismissive saying that we were the only people complaining about the heat in the room they didn t even try to check what was the issue or anything like that it turned out that they had switched off th air condition earlier this month to save money and they wouldn t turn it back on just poor service later we met few people at same hotel who had the same complaint but they were ignored too the hotel is outdated with facilities going back to not even clean do not get fooled by the big entrance all the furniture is out of date and dirty fridge in the room smells and not working wifi is diseaster doesn t work for emails and extremely slow every few minutes you have to go back to main page to log in into internet bathroom always had a bad smell and if you careful you will notice there is no window or extractor fan the restaurent don t even try it we had to eat one night there our mistake it was awful taste and expensive we waited a bit for the food we just realised the bartender next door came through the main doors with a bag he went into to buy whats needed to be cooked from opposite shop it is not cheap even definitely not more than stars
