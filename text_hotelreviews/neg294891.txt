access to metro is not close and is more in a residential area i had a bigger room booked for night due to unavailability of room booked for next nights while the staff helped me to find a room that i could continue to use for next nights with out having to shift but since the room tarrif was higher for the night for bigger room i should have got a complimentary breakfast instead of being charged for the same it s a customer experience
