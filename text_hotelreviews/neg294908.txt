when we came to check in they didn t have our amended reservation being told that the booking confirmation from booking com was wrong and they did not have a room for me that it was my fault or booking coms fault and that i had to sort it by the front office manager blond hair not very nice couldn t of cared less i then had to call booking com while my disabled mother and sick brother waited in the lobby after minutes credit of being on the phone to booking com we finally got it sorted did we get an apology oh no the front office manager was too good for that also simultaneously while our situation was occurring i could see literally people to the left and right of me having a similar situation problems with confirmation to be fair natalia the front office assistant did apologise as the fault was from their reservations department and did give us a lovely room then during the stay room was lovely however on the second day as standard in hotels we thought our room would receive a full service you guessed it not even the toilet paper was refilled and there was people in the room so we had to call the front desk to ask for our room to be fully serviced when the room attendants came back to service the room all the did was giggle the whole time then another day i came back after the room had been serviced i came back to my make up all over the floor and several make up pallets had been broken due to the floor impact when i brought all of this up to what seemed to be the gm on the front desk he did give me one complimentary breakfast which was a nice and appreciated gesture however i honestly expected more from a four star hotel while i do understand being busy the fact that we were treated so badly on check in by management kind of spoilt the experience
