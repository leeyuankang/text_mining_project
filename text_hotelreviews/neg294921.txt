there s a fridge in the room but it s not a fridge it doesn t do anything when we first got into the room the fridge was actually super hot inside we called management to help fix it but the maintenance guy just told us it s not a fridge it just holds things this is quite a problem as we really needed a fridge it s really hot in barcelona in the summer the other thing would be that the hotel is not very close to the metro station it can seem quite far walking in the heat
