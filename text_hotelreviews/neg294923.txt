there was no mineral water or stocked mini bar as was indicated during booking air conditioning did not work upon arrival and staff did not request maintenance until after we reported it for a second time the next day so we had to sleep in a hot room on our first night the coffee machine was a kettle the restaurant refused to provide a bowl and spoon so we could eat in our room breakfast buffet was per person per day or per person per day if we paid in advance but we were able to feed ourselves for a fraction of that price elsewhere we paid for breakfast in advance and were overcharged when we changed our minds and asked for a refund we were short changed by which we didn t get back as we didn t realise until later of three ice machines only one was working and it was on the first floor we were on the sixth but that machine was empty by the end of our stay and i had to go to the restaurant on the ground floor for ice despite having a free spa session we were required to rent the slippers and bathrobe that were obligatory for entry we used the bar once and were overcharged there as well housekeeping staff were excellent but we had to ask for more toilet paper and tea and coffee weren t replenished parts of the hotel looked out dated and though the rooms were supposed to be soundproof i was awoken by the noise of housekeeping other guests in the hallway despite both doors being closed
