the receptionist asked would we like a quiet room and i said yes when we got to the room it was a family room with a door connecting us to strangers next door light shone from under the door into our room and we could hear every word preventing us from sleeping at night i found this a very creepy experience and complained to reception i was told there were no other rooms i did not like the view out the window of concrete flags covered in cigarette ends and nothing else the bed had a very hard matress and the springs twanged every time you moved i think it was very cheap
