attitude of the night manager was very unprofessional after a long day i had to wait at the reception for minutes to find the staff and request for the room key as the key issued at the time of check in didnt work finally night manager turned up and rather than being apologetic he blamed the management of the hotel for keeping the hotel short staffed his exact words were i didnt make this roster how unprofessional he also encouraged me to file a complaint i really hope his manager speaks to him and reminds him of what hospitality is also the guys jacket was completely crumpled looked like he had no interest in his job
