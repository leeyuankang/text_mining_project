we stayed for weeks which is far too long time in a room without balcony on a sunny trip this was a none cancellation booking so there was no way to switch hotels probably our mistake the staff said they couldn t do anything to help us with cutting week off our booking there was only elevator working for almost week two were out of order and it is just unbelievable how a hotel of this size doesn t do anything about it for such a long time waiting for an elevator took far too long time the hotel has ice machines on floors but only one was working the whole time floor this lack of maintenance elevators ice machines for so long time is a huge disrespect to the guests the say free wifi in their ad but really that is a poor wifi speed i had to pay euros for week of decent wifi speed
