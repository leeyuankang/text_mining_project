when we first arrived and checked in we found the staff quite rude no information was given to us about where anything was or what time breakfast was or where we had to go for breakfast once we arrived in our room which was a king room which was nice the bath had dirty marks in there were stains on the ceiling and the smoke alarm was covered up with a plastic bag we were not aware that the pool would be closed although it rained anyway so it was ok the spa facilities can only be used by guests free of charge between the hours of and after that you have to pay which i don t think is right we were here from friday to monday and was an ok stay for nights for longer stays i wouldn t choose this hotel to stay in
