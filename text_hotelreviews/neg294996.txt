lack of staff and the spa was shut on mondays and children only allowed to use the spa when no one wants to use it at that time because you are in barcelona doing things very poor and family unfriendly and not advertised up front if i m paying for facilities i expect to be able to use them days a week and when i want with my family i m the paying customer if i want to go in the pool at with my son it should not be a an issue but it was the hotel was full of rules and regulations which is a turn off treat your customers with a little respect
