arrived to our room to find the workmen using angle grinder doing work outside our bedroom window on the lift shaft very very noisy and reception was not very helpful we eventually moved rooms to one that was not much better also we asked for an extra cup sugar tea and coffee as they only put enough in the room for guests and we had our daughter with us they said we could not have anymore as that was all we were allowed then after arguing they agreed to bring some to the room before pm which didn t happen i then had to go back down to the reception to complain and we eventually got it but its not what i would call very relaxing when you have to argue to get anything
