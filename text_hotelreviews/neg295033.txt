the hotel is not worth its stars when entering the room there was a terrible smell which did not go away for days the pool bar was closed and the pool abandoned even though it was quite nice weather location is not so good minutes walk to the nearest metro station in terms of lunch or dinner in the hotel very poor choice of dishes and none of them is fresh but pre cooked overall i would not recommend this hotel for a visit in barcelona
