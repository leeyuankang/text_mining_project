cleanliness of the bathroom this was a nightmare although the bathroom looked refreshed it was a bit dirty i think managers don t pay attention to detail and this is surprising at the end of the day this hotel have and bathrooms should be clean apart from that fire doors in the corridor on the floor were noisy and it was hard to get some decent sleep as whenever people were walking in or out the doors were banging so loud that it was impossible to not get awaken
