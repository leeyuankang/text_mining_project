we struggled to regulate the room temperature and needed to open a window so that it was neither too cold nor too hot in the room unfortunately the back side of the hotel is right across from the tracks and the station for the local trains and our window overlooked that it was noisy and nothing for a view the area itself is not the most attractive nor is it near places of interest it was disappointing that the small park adjacent to the hotel was permanently closed and under some sort of construction that green space would have added to and improved the location a little owing to all of this i would consider the room a bit pricey
