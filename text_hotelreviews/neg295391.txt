the room was tiny and the bathroom was dirty i requested with plenty of notice a room with a view as it was a special trip for me and my wife i was on the first floor and when i finially managed to open the dilapadeted metal window i had a large tree in front of me and a active building site the toilet keep flushing on its own i reporteed this to the reception below and was told we will get someone to look at it on monday i was checking out on the sunday so this was not much use to me
