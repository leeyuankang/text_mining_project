the room itself looks nothing like advertised in the pictures the lobby looks amazing but the rooms look like they haven t been renovated since the early century very professionally done photos on the booking com website it was very loud in the hotel by that i mean the rooms were not at all soundproof you can hear people talking in the room next door and you can also hear every time they would close the door as it would end with a loud bang probably because of the door hinges believe me i can sleep through anything and am not a light sleeper but this was loud the bathroom was terrible as it was hard to get warm water it was either scalding hot or freezing cold and the bathtub itself was clogged so you would be showering with scalding hot water while standing in freezing cold water
