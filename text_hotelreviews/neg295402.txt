breakfast would stay again but would eat breakfast elsewhere in future everything self service coffee machine too complicated to work many people gave up and didn t bother when eventually i asked a waitress how to work it she took ages getting it to work and then the coffee tasted awful when i did get it food was average as i said before i would definitely stay again as overall was a pleasant experience
