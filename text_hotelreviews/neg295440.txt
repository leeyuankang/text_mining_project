i had booked an executive king room and had paid on arrival i found that they sent me to a little box room in what felt like the basement i complained and it took about mins in reception holding my ground before i was finally given a downgraded room and a partial refund they did not telll me what they had done with my booking and tried to get away with it hoping i woul just accept the room very disappointed as previously have been very impressed
