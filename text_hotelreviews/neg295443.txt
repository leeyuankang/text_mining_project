shower an utter disaster vertical so no flexibility as to where the water went i had to hold it by hand whilst trying to soap the areas of my body the alternative was to crouch down on a slippery floor no height control the temperature was lukewarm bad design my room was facing euston station so very noisy should have triple glazing on the windows
