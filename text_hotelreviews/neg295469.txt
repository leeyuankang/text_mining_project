i didn t like the fact i was mislead about breakfast and charged extra when i didn t eat breakfast and then when i questioned this i was spoken to like an idiot by the staff the bathroom needs to have a vent as it got uncomfortably hot very quickly when showering the television didn t work in the room and there was a doer leading to the next room which made the noise from next door very loud i have already complained to thistle directly and i want my money back absolutely disgraceful
