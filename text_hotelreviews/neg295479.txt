the hotel didn t have my second room booked through booking com and they said this happen often but only with this company they were able offer a room at the same price bar closes when there are still guests in the bar unusual to have last drink time at the bar especially in a london hotel when you get back to the hotel late and want to socialise with other guest and not have to sit in a bedroom with room service
