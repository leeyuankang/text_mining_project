we spent the first night in a room which was facing an inner courtyard at the back of the hotel at some of the hotel staff were starting their shifts and coming in via their entrance this was not a public path they were really shouting outside so much so we were woken up and this went on for around mins the first room we were in was dark and had what looked like some damp in the corner this room needs refurbishing i also found some pubic hair in the shower when we arrived and there was gunk dust under the beds the tv was old small and several of the channels didn t work properly
