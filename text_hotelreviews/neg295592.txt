as it was labeled a business hotel i expected to be able to print documents etc but no the ladies at reception insisted i had to email them the documents as there was no other computer i was flabbergasted and asked if there was any other way she said well you don t see a printer in your room do you how is that a response to a guest finally over the phone she said i could print without sending an email so i brought my usb drive and then the other ladies there were in total at reception said no i couldn t i must email them the documents they were also not able to tell me if there was somewhere else i could go to to get my documents printed via a usb drive after much hassling i was finally told i could log into my own email and print it off the reception computer i compromised as there was no other way all of this meant i had multiple trips to the reception and irked some other guests who thought i was cutting the que at reception one guest told me off and i was not in the mood to explain this experience on the first morning of a week s stay really left a bitter taste in my mouth also on the same day while dining with a guest in the restaurant the waiter mixed the orders of myself and my colleague up we both ordered steak rare versus medium as we were having a business meeting we did not want to make a fuss and it was particularly frustrating to eat food that is not to one s taste lastly this happened on just one of the days but the housekeeping did not top up the toiletries i didn t raise this point however as i did not want to call up reception again the only reason i didn t move to a different hotel was because of the location and because i was with colleagues who were staying at the same hotel
