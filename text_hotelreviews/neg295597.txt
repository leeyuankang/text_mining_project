the bed was extremely hard it was beds pushed together and when sleeping with my girlfriend was very uncomfortable there was air conditioning but no heating so the room was freezing at times and the room looked nothing like it did on the website i felt very angry with the way the room looked and over all had a bad experience due to the room not being the same as described i booked the deluxe double bedroom there was nothing deluxe about it also our view was other people s room windows have been considering calling trading standards to get my money back as i payed almost for this crap room for nights breakfast not included
