bar closed early and turned away customers in separate parties customers sitting along from us had to move due to flies it was nice to see in the bathroom the saver cream and toothbrush and vanity set but because they weren t used on the first day they were taken out the room we have stayed in better stars rooms very small and no mini fridge definitely not worth the money
