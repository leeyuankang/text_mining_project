hotel room was comparable to that of a cheap b b in blackpool probably worth around per night small cramped room with tiny bathroom single glazed windows meant you could hear everything outside and stud wall between rooms meant you could hear everything in the next room and i mean everything not good when you have a small child travelling with you owners have obviously spent lots of money upgrading reception area bar and restaurant to make the hotel look nice on first impressions but the rest of the hotel is in dire need of renovation people who rate this hotel obviously have low expectations worst hotel we stayed in on our three week trip around belgium paris london the other hotels we stayed in for similar prices were much more luxurious and had been modernised would only recommend staying here if using euston station the next day in fact i wouldn t even recommend it for that the ibis next door would probably be a more comfortable nights sleep
