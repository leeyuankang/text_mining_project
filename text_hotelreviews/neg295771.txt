had a bad experience with the housekeeping staff after heading out at and leaving the housekeeping sign on the door we retuned to the room at which was not tidied we called reception and made them aware of this it was agreed for housekeeping to see to the room at when we were out after making the call to reception an aggressive and rude lady turned up at the door we where accused of calling reception at telling that we did not want housekeeping however this couldn t be possible as we were not even in the hotel building at that time the woman was using hand gestures and raising her voice at us saying that we have got her into trouble by reception i was extremely shaken up by this therefore i went straight down to reception and spoke with a manager who then handled the situation due to this palava we were late to attend the theatre show and had a very harassed time getting ready before our night out exterminate disappointed that we have to experience this the following morning we spoke with a manager and raised the issue again the manager was extremely apologetic and gave us an apology although we do appreciate this complaint being dealt with efficiently this is not the standard of customer service we expected to recive not a good end to our trip
