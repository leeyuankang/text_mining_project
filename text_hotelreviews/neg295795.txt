furniture in bedrooms i felt let the hotel down as dated and a bit scruffy and restaurant tables where we were sat were the same lady on reception who originally rang for the taxi didn t ask price first or find out when the taxi would arrive at hotel needless to say she didn t check that it had arrived for us so we were sat there for until i caught the attention of the guy on reception our towels were poor worn definitely need replacing my son s egg was very undercooked at breakfast on otherwise i d say it s a good and we would stay again
