the food got a little bland after days stay at the hotel it just started to taste like cardboard the person who checked us into the hotel was a bit on the rude and hostile side it was like we were actually interrupting that person from spending time on facebook or something but it s important to mention that it was only this one experience that was a minus during the entire day stay
