as an architect i looked at my stay with an analytical eye when i arrived at my room on the third floor of the modern wing the first thing that struck me was that the hallway with the cupboards is too narrow people want space to open their suitcases but not on the bed where i would never think to put them as they would soil the duvet the desk may be too long perhaps make it shorter to provide a bench for opening suitcases in fact make it a double decker so that a lighter suitcase can be lifted to the upper shelf the marble in the bathroom was lovely but the mastic used to seal the seams completely undoes any aesthetic gesture we do not use so much of it in the us there must be some alternative to stem any damaging leaking the fancy multi buttoned toilet really isn t necessary in fact to me it seemed a joke and a little vulgar if someone discovers that these toilets stem disease then i ll rethink it one sink tap was broken and the awful puny rectangular handle design made both taps hard to turn comfort comfort comfort the shower could have been smaller to accommodate a wider hallway as indicated previously i would have preferred a tub with a shower head but realize that i probably should have asked for one lastly all bathrooms can never have too many hooks and towel bars for wet towels etc many guests will want to rinse out the odd garment i suppose there are a few who will pay the relatively exorbitant prices for the laundry service but i think a relatively inexpensive laundry service would be a huge draw to an untapped clientele today s inexpensive low water front loaders would allow for all sizes of requests of course if a predominantly short stay business hotel it may not be worth it my view was of mechanical equipment which should be camouflaged better it s a big letdown to see them the breakfast lounge should be more colorful or another kind of subdued it looks boring to me
