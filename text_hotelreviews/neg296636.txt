staff were friendly but they were junior level and there was an unexperienced trainee who was unable to help and almost put me in a taxi to airport trouble due to her mismanagemnt of my request thankfully her supervisor sorted out the issue i think staff should be more senior with more experience and training to be able to support on travellers needs and inquiries
