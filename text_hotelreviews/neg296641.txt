the hotel is very rigid with chekin and checkout we had arrived at and the usually chekin was between and and the hotel was not flexible in offering a room to rest and the lobby is simply a short corridor with chairs so no where to rest we were expecting a more lenient treatment for checkin considering we have kids they accepted we stay by the pool till the room was ready at pool is tiny round one and we couldn t stay long for a long relaxing morning at checkout we wanted to extend for couple of hours we didn t even mind moving to one small room to freshen up before our late flight the only option the hotel had for us is to pay an extra hourly rate we thought this is very unfriendly especially with family of kids the breakfast time was flexible tthough till midday but we didn t like the quality at all the rooms are not clean at all and we used the coffee mugs and glasses for juice the room cleaners simply kept them unwashed for the entire days of our visit the reception staff and the breakfast room staff where nice and tried accommodating to our request but we felt they had no flexibility with their management i would rate it a except the nice interiors which deserves
