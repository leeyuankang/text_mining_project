i do wish they would ve had a dresser to unpack into there were only small shallow drawers in bedside tables the closet was very small with only a few hangers not enough for people as well some throw rugs would be nice to dampen the sound of people walking a floor above and would be warm to the feet i was disappointed to learn when we arrived that the permit for the roof top deck pool bar had not been received as i booked here wanting that area to be available and it was not open we booked the jr suite and would have liked a coffee table and chair in the sitting couch area just a couch there made it less useful for a gathering or to do work there on a few occasions there was noise of doors shutting over and over again in the hallway and noise from the floor above as well that woke us up
