there was nothing about the hotel that we did not like busy road outside but no traffic noise in hotel the hot food at breakfast could have done with being hotter for our liking slightly disappointed the rooftop pool would not open until summer also think there should be a hot plate container for hot foods likes eggs bacon etc otherwise no complaints whatsoever
