checkin was not friendly i arrived around and was chatting to receptionists about queuing for more than hours at the airport they said the available room is on ground floor and when she showed me the room it was for disabled i told her i want a regular room and then she was not so friendly and said it was the only available rooms if i needed one straight away else i have to wait min for my room where i can take a walk outside said it as my only option i don t get it when people checkout at they could send someone from housekeeping to make the room fast that is if really none was available i was pretty sure there were available rooms moreover they could have offered me to sit and have a glass of water or coffee until my room is ready i went out and came back min later when it was obvious for them that i cannot make myself walk after trip and queuing i stayed in same chain in emma bcn and in new york and they were amazing was surprised with this check in
