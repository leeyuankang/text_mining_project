hotel is really run down for example there was water dripping from the ceiling in the corridor of our room bathroom was not properly cleaned bunch of hairs from previous clients on the floor and in drawer bed is extremely soft for us personally not comfortable swimming pool chlorine way too strong and pool was anyway not really clean we ordered breakfast in the room the morning of our departure and they brought it up with minutes delay and the very worst a gentleman that said that was a client came in into our kids room with his own room key his room key happened to be a master key that opened all hotel rooms we did not even receive a proper apology from the hotel for this issue to cut it short definitely not worth the money we spent for the stay and we believe this hotel should not be tagged as gran lujo nor star
