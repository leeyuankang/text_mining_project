not enough staff basically the restaurant is often very busy and a lot of waiting for food and constantly calling for service which was very frustrating and doesn t feel very luxury nobody came to pour wine starters came at the same times as main courses we had to get up and try to find a waiter to bring a fork or even a wine glass which is not really what a luxury restaurant is supposed to be about if you are paying you expect to get what you pay for the staff don t seem trained in the aspect of luxury service they seem a bit clueless although friendly but this hotel makes out that it is a top luxury hotel there is hardly any shade at the pool so you have to fight for a lounger in a shade area quite often the pool area near the restaurant is quite dirty and not cleaned often it seems it seems that some local people actually just turn up order drinks and then use the pool too we had noise issues with wedding events going on too
