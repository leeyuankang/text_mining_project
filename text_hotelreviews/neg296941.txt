far from the city center and nothing to do in the immediate neighborhood nor any restaurants near the hotel you must take a cab to visit the city go out to dinner etc the restaurant menu was so so room service took an hour to arrive and the chicken i had ordered was undercooked the buffet breakfast offered a great selection but watch out the waiters start clearing off the food a half hour before the end of the breakfast service we arrived for the breakfast were told to wait because the dining room was full not minutes after we were seated all the food vanished
