wow where to start here as a multi time visitor to this hotel i ve had first hand experience of the changes over the years i have to say that this visit did not impress me for a hotel its most definitely gone downhill over the last few years day checkin arrived early at not really a problem we went for a swim and some lunch and was told that they d come find us if the room was available before the checkin they didnt come and find us arrive back at the front desk at room not ready just a few minutes mr xxxx no problem we ll wait here reception after minutes they go chase house keeping again after a prompt by me i ve two small children travelling with me since and by this point we want a shower before we go out no problem just one minute they are cleaning the windows a further minutes i walk the few metres to the reception to chase again no not ready so we leave the few small items we have and we go out to the fairground to make the most of the day thanks for keeping me and my small children sat in reception for minutes no apology no glass of wine no drinks for the children mediocre check in experience return after a excellent few hours at the nearby attraction to be met by the same person who d basically span me a line at checkin he did take the time to gesture to his colleagues with raised eyebrows and a shrug of the shoulders when he saw me approaching nice professional touch we are shown to the room by the said person all cocky now the room is ready its now only to open the door and find that the room is made up for a couple no beds for my children so here we go again housekeeping contacted and we sat for a further minutes as beds were wheeled in made up etc beds rollup z beds and definitely not the proper single beds on the website photos
