one of the female staff at the hotel probably needs to learn how to treat your customers when we checked in we were told repeatedly that we hadnt pre paid for breakfast and despite showing bills and confirmations they refused to take our word we re talking pounds for breakfasts once she stopped being difficult and double checked she found that we had indeed paid for it but she didnt apologise until i hinted it just a totally retarded way of talking to your customer and not the greeting you expect when u arrive at a five star location i will not go back to this place unless they are on some riddic discount where i wudnt care abt service but just use their facilities at a fraction of the price im sure she didnt even understand how they come across you dont just say no to peoples face repeatedly and question their credibility when they are your customers they overcharge u on everything btw
