where to start this time paying each for breakfast when all i wanted was a cup of coffee and a croissant the handle falling off the toilet door and getting locked in for mins the staff not seeming bothered when i told them getting asked for a charge to pay for an extra hours on room for a late departure when my pregnant wife really needed a sleep at lunchtime this hotel used to be my favourite hotel in my favourite city but it isn t anymore shame as i have been coming since it feels like you are less star and more about charging a price for everything
