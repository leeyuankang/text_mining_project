its a shame to have to be negative about this place but it deserves a grilling as it could be so much better the staff are very friendly however they steer cleer of any problems and will pass it round the table hoping you will just disapear all staff seem to be doing every job conceivable it reminded me a little of the carry on movie when they visited hels bels dont have a clue about how to deal with families wanted to put my young children in a seperate room on a different floor my old a type diabetic and then tried to charge me a night extra for a foldaway bed when i told them he would have to stay with us as we didnt have the joining rooms requested it would help if at least one of the staff actually had children of their own so they would know how to behave very money orientated did not inform any of the guests that the whole restaurant had been booked out for a private function which as you can imagine makes things a little more than difficult when you have a diabetic son halfway up a mountain and are now forced to eat whatever is on offer areas of the hotel gardens always being partitioned off for weddings or corporate events can make it a bit uncomfortable as the pool and bar area is amidst all this come on who wants to be walking about in their swimsuit at a wedding or their bosses work do the staff do try hard and are more than friendly but i would recommend they actually experience a star hotel so they know what a guest would expect if your intending on touring the city and surrounding areas make sure you have a car and they do charge a night for parking which cannot be avoided as there is literally no where else to park
