very inconvenient timings of the shuttle back from the city center last one comes back at around pm some of the reception staff are unfriendly and not very willing to help though some are very welcoming it s a hit or miss most of the furniture and decor in the room are a little worn out feels like they haven t been renovated updated in many years
