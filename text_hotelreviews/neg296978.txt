the staff is absolutely unfriendly they are so cold that it makes you feel embarrassed in any interaction all the time the friendly ones always seem to be overloaded with the work to be done we ve ordered two glasses of cava in the swimming pool and half hour later we needed to cancel the order as they haven t been served although the hotel is classified as a stars gl this doesn t reflect the reality there s an aim of looking like sumptuous and definitely there s beauty everywhere but they are so far away of providing high levels of service that i do not recommend it at all i know barcelona by heart and there are plenty of much much better staying options
