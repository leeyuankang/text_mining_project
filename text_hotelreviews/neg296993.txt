the food and drink was a little over priced no tea and coffee facilities in the room so ordered pots of green tea in the lounge and got charged for what is ultimately just a tea bag and hot water breakfast was nice but could have offered a bit more the poached eggs came out very undercooked most days so had to ask for them to re do them
