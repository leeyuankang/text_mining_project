i ve stayed at this hotel four times before the first two times were great the last time i felt that it was going down hill i thought that i d give it another go but was once again disappointed the whole place has an air of a hotel in financial difficulty there used to be a large gym now there is gym equipment around the indoor swimming pool and a tiny room with a few machines there is a wall where there used to be a steam room this is a five star grand deluxe hotel that had no water in the water machine around the pool for three days of our stay they have reduced the room prices a lot since our last stay it seems that they have done this to fill the rooms and then make their money from the extortionate bar and restaurant prices it s for a coffee for a small beer for a g t a plate of ham with bread i personally love the location of the hotel as i used to live away and have friends in the area but as a base for a stay in barcelona it is not a great choice it is far away from the centre and the hotel shuttle to the centre runs three times a day at with the return journeys thirty minutes later why is there no evening late night transportation again this smacks of a hotel trying to get people back there as early a possible to try to make a profit i am not certain but i do not think that this used to be the case i ve noticed that from my responses to different aspects of the hotel that booking com has given the hotel a rating of under out of this is probably unfair as this is still a very good hotel but if you are expecting this to be what is once was or are looking for a truly five star experience then sadly i expect that you will be disappointed
