the batteries in the locker had run very low which made it very difficult to operate that wasn t fixed until days later the breakfast lounge kitchen was undermanned things would run out and it would take too long to wait for them to be replaced there were quite a number of cheap iron chairs there that needed fixing the rubber pad at the bottom had come off so there was this incredible screech every time you moved the chair or stood up the beds were uncomfortable too stiff i found it strange having to pay for all the hotel weeks in advance and that the payment would be nonrefundable
