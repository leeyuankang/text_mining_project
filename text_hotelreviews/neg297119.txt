bathroom was great however i asked the hotel receptionist for the best room in the house based on the type of room we paid for tongue in cheek of course she smiled and said of course when we arrived at the room myself and my girlfriend saw two single beds while it was not the end of the world it was a little disappointing we decided not to ask to switch rooms but others may only want a double bed in a double room so just a heads up
