the receptionist was terrible i got sick in the middle of the night because i ate something wrong when i called the receptionist to ask them if they had an emergency kit they not only answered no they were really rude and impolite they basically said f you i was really sick so i tried to ask if there was another solution a pharmacy the answer was no no no they didn t make any effort to help me but then someone else on the reception took over and he was helpful the day after i took my breakfast which was included in the price i already payed in my room because i was still sick when checking out they charged me the breakfast i wanted to tell them it was not correct but before i could even say a word the receptionist went no no no i really had to insist before he would listen i said you can charge me the fee for taking my breakfast in my room but i am not going to pay a breakfast that ia already had payed for so yeah the receptionist are maybe stressed out but anyway i don t think that should be an excuse to treat your customers badly that was for me a bad experience
