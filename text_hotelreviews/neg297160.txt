the location of the hotel was good for the sagrada familia but the area itself wasn t the nicest and was quite a way away from the action at la rambla el born passeig de gracia though the breakfasts were decent enough the restaurant of this hotel for an evening meal was definitely not standard you are likely to want to eat out and about anyway but if there are any nights you want the convenience of eating at the hotel it s going to be basic food like frozen pizza though admittedly it is cheap
