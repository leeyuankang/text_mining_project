i didnt like the fact that this hotel offered no kettle or coffee and tea service we phoned down to ask about this and was told only the floor has this so we had to pay euros to have a kettle in the room also we were staying on the floor and for nights out of the we could smell smoking in the corridoors we phoned down one morning and told this to reception staff which they said they were very sorry and would get one of the cleaning staff to check it out so for these reasons i would not return to this hotel
