our price did not include breakfast which we were told would cost euros per head each day ouch we thought we wouldn t fork out for that as it was too hot for a buffet anyway instead we recommend trying some of the baracafe s you will pass if walking towards the arc de triomf they sell incredibly tasty pastries for euros each which will keep you going well through the day there is also a lidl minutes down the road and enough room in your mini fridge to keep some goodies but if you ve got the money treat yourself the standard of everything else is that good i m sure the breakfast would be great
