definitely not a star hotel despite managements protestations to the contrary over priced for what you get not a great location a solid minute walk to the centre of town the majority of attractions no tea coffee facilities provided in room when we requested these it took several days for them to arrive wireless was so slow we gave up trying to use it initial room we were allocated was extremely noisy we could clearly hear when people in the next room used the toilet had sex etc street traffic noise was bad staff were helpful in moving us to another room but this was still very noisy hotel management claims rooms are sound proofed but this was certainly not our experience lots of young exchange students staying at the hotel contributed to a rather noisy environment
