the bed was really hard might as well have slept on the floor i didn t have a decent nights sleep in the nights that i stayed there the headboard and pillow was a mismatch too and made sitting up watching tv really uncomfortable although what we had tasted nice there isn t a lot of choice for dinner in the hotel restaurant
