the bed was kind of hard for my back did not meet my request upon booking for extra sets of towels until i requested them upon arrival also iron and iron board not available in the room unless you request them no coffee maker and coffee or tea in the room when we checked in noticed the two ladies chatting while checking us in which was annoying because we traveled for hours and needed some rest so just thinking that they should have asked us how was our flight and expedited our check in process sooner
