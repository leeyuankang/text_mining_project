we both found the beds extremely uncomfortable the shuttle service is not complimentary as it might sugges on the website you have to pay cash to the driver before you leave the airport you cannot choose the time you want to be picked up when you go back to the airport we had a flight and they wanted to pick us up at it took the receptionist a couple of phone calls to get them to change pick up to and still we had to go to each hotel to pick up people for an hour before arriving at the airport take a taxi more direct less wasted time for only a couple of more
