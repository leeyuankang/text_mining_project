we checked in at night and they said the room was not available they had overbooked which was very disappointing as we have booked months in advance we had to sleep in a small bed rather than the two singles which we have requested earlier the receptionist told us they will change us to the single rooms the next morning but we went and it was still not ready so we kept our luggage and decided to go out rather than upgrading us to a better room this is what we got what a shame the breakfast was horrible not many options and when we ordered outside the menu it took forever and wasn t even cooked well eggs so we only tried it once and went out to cafe s the other days during out stay the cleaning lady walked in our room while we were asleep in the morning despite the do not disturb sign outside the door the cleaning ladies were loud and we could hear them chatting at the hall way all morning the blankets were not comfortable at all it felt like a bed sheet rather than an actuall blanket the hotel didn t provide good toiletries not even a conditioner we asked for a taxi at the reception and they told us they won t be able to order one to the hotel so go look for one on the road overall we had bad experience at this hotel and its a shame its called a four star hotel because clearly it doesn t live it up definitely not coming back nor recommending it to anyone if the service was better i would have enjoyed my stay better despite the lack discomfort of their facilities
