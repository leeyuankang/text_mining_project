the wifi did not work at all it is free but it doesn t work the bathroom was a bit primitive there was no tub and no shower tub you would just shower on the floor and make a mess but the personnel would clean it every day the walls were a bit thin you could hear noise coming from outside the room overall i wouldn t rate this hotel as a star hotel but more like a star hotel
