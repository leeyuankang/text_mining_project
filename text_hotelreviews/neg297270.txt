room service was very slow although they did apologise without being confronted and forgo the drinks bill as a result the cafe facilities were poor the menu was limited to light snacks and had no restaurant that can be accessed at night only a light menu was offered please note i sent a review just before this that was meant for the hotel luz in castellano which was excellent i now send this one to replace it sorry for the mistake
