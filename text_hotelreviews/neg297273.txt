there aren t many restaurants and bars nearby although it s only a relatively short walk to la ramblas and the centre of barcelona the tables at the buffet breakfast were a little slow in being cleared up by the staff so clean cutlery was in short supply on the morning of our breakfast overall though i found this hotel excellent
