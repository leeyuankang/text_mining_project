we had to travel a while to get anywhere the immediate surrounding area was nothing special the hotel was a bit pricy for what you got and i didn t like the austere modern look and the bed was a little soft my dislikes are mostly my own personal preferences and to be fair not the failings of the hotel none of those issues would stop me recommending this hotel which is very good
