i didn t like the service overall the room we asked for wasn t available when we arrive and it wasn t as the one we expected therefore we upgraded the room which was okish with an euros supplement every day of our stay we asked them to have a gesture cause we didn t have the room available as we arrived but we never got an answer until i called them and the answer was no the breakfast fast service was poor to me the responsible kept coming to us to ask if we have registered for this service every time we will be having breakfast however we did get free breakfast the day
