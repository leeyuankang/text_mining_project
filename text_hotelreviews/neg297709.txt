the location of the hotel is good in the fact it is near the dlr railway station however apart from that it is in a particularly tucked away place with not many amenities places to eat nearby besides a tesco express so had to travel by dlr into the city centre wardrobes in our room were pretty small it wouldn t have accommodated much more than a two night stay and the lighting in the room could have been better with a single spot light placed in the corner by the wardrobe with no central focal light all minor things which didn t affect our trip at all
