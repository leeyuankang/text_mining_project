the buffet breakfast was good quality but only just warm disappointed that we had some noisy neighbours on the night of our stay we did mention this when we checked out the young man on reception asked if we had informed reception during the night which we hadn t so i can t really complain i did get the feeling that if we had informed them they would have challenged the guests which is good to know
