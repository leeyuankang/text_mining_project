my room was freezing and the noise of the neighbouring bathroom was clearly audible in the room there was also strange tremors in the room which may have been the tube i had to ask for extra blankets as even with the heating on the room was like a cold store there were no plug in radiators available but clearly the air con heating was not effective i did not sleep well and feel that although the staff were nice my complaint was not really addressed properly i was offered a room change but it was already very late and i was unpacked and in bed and it would have been more of an upheaval and no guarantee another room would have been any better the staff did not seem to be surprised when i stated the nature of my complaint making me think it was not the first time they had heard this the mattress was also very poor quality
