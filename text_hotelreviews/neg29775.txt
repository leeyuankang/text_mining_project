i never saw any british employees which would really have completed the sherlock holmes theme at the hotel depending on which room you are in they can be puzzling to find i suppose that goes with the sherlock holmes theme but can be frustrating after a couple cocktails or if you are in a hurry we ended up being moved to another room since ours had some issues which i will explain there seems to be some major differences in rooms that are in the same class we paid for an executive double but the first room we were in was much smaller than the next executive double we were changed to the first room had no room service menu pen paper american plug as advertised and the minibar fridge was frozen shut the room was ice cold and even turning off the thermostat for hours did not change that problem i would have had no idea there was room service available had i not been changed to a different room and seen a menu as it s not advertised on the tv information or anywhere else they may be missing out there
