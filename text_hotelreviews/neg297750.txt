the breakfast buffet was seriously underwhelming and served in a dark windowless basement didn t help staying for days without absolutely any changes seems unacceptable especially during summer with an abundance of fresh produce available suggest the hotel and chef kitchen personnel to review menu offerings and replace with more appealing fresh and healthy choices such as small bircher m sli with berries gluten free breads cakes and pastries omlettes by order with herbs avocado sheep and goat cheeses with a little effort the breakfast could be much better
