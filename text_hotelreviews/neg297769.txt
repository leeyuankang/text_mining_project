the most uncomfortable thing was the temperature control in the room i didnt want to complain as they were pretty helpful however i fell ill over night due to the room temperature goinf up and down i was going through cold and hot sweats all night and then couldnt adjust the temeperature at all its not a major issue but for one night the amount i paid was not value for money definitely a bit overpriced for the room i had especially as it was only for one night and the hotel didnt seem too busy on that day either i checked online later that evening and the same room was available for nearly cheaper
