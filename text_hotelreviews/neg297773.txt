i asked for a face cloth as there was not one in the room which i would have expected for this type of hotel i phoned reception the lady could not understand me and asked if i wanted a bathrobe and slippers she put me on hold as she could not understand what i said call to reception asked for a flannel the man could not understand i spelt out the word next a young polish girl arrived at my door with five towels she had to come back with two face cloths when i made a drawing in the air of what i wanted i don t expect this in a hotel in the uk especially one as beautiful and high end as this i spoke to a member of staff on leaving about this and he did not seem interested as his eyes kept reverting back to the job he was doing on the computer so front desk in my opinion was not very good also the directions to the hotel by bus were very misleading i had to get help to find it by an off duty policeman as he said i should not be walking down the side streets on my own
