if we had taken our dog it would have been an extra charge of to cover the cost of an extra clean after the dog this seemed expensive especially considering our room had not been cleaned very well before our arrival the room was dusty especially the bedside tables and the floor wasn t clean one cup was badly cracked other bad points there are lots of mirrors in the room except near the desk dressing table not so easy to dry hair put on makeup the washbasin in shower room was very low which made it hard for my tall husband to shave
