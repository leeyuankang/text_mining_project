breakfast was not included and iit was very expensive to buy once at the hotel the shower door wasn t wide enough and water came out all over the bathroom floor we did ask for a room with a good view as we were celebrating our anniversary but the room given to us had a small window so high up that we had to stand on a chair to look out and the view was of the car park
