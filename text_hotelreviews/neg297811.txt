the room we stayed in was quite small for a superior room and looked lovely but was not practical i bumped my head twice on the very awkwardly placed bedside tables the bathroom was small the bed was not too comfortable there was no draught beer at the bar which is not acceptable in a four star hotel this all said we did enjoy our stay and most likely would stay again for a short break i feel we got star decor but star fascilities
