i have never been charged a deposit in advance of staying in a hotel before and i have stayed in all sorts of places all over the world it was a bit of a shock to be over poorer than i had expected as i walked through the door even though i got it back at the end i couldn t enjoy it during my stay i expect a small room as a single traveller so it wasn t too much of a shock there were too many little problems though like no teabags being left by room service and a long wait in the restaurant when i asked for some i eventually gave up went out and bought some and when there is a large puddle of reddy brown water that has leaked from somewhere onto the bathroom floor i would like to at least be asked by one of the investigating staff members if i would like to be moved i would have said yes some places allow you to relax and enjoy the luxury of your stay but this was an unforgettably and undeniably extremely overpriced experience
