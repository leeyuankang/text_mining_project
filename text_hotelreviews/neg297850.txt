unfortunately i was in room next to the lift fab views of the nighttime city but noisy because of the lift and the swing doors leading into the corridor it sounded as though someone was moving furniture every time they were used they should have soft close doors there parking is limited so remember to reserve a space before you get to the hotel i gave it a low comfort score purely because of the lift shaft and door noise otherwise my overall score would have been closer to instead of i will stay again
