decor not to my taste but probably is to most others queen room rather small some confusion amongst staff sometimes e g room not serviced after first night apparently not on schedule when key didn t work on third night just needed reformatting i was told initially that it had run out of power then that it might not work because i might have sat on it nothing major just some personnel needing a bit more training experience
