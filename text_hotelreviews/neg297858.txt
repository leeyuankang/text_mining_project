a minor issue the room we had unfortunately had a fault with the air conditioning unit which would very occasionally make a horrible loud noise for a few seconds this was potentially a problem but as it didn t last long i told the staff about it at the end of my stay becasue i didn t want the hassle of moving all my stuff once we had settled in i m sure they would have moved us if i had asked it seemed that sort of place it was room on the lower ground floor by the way
