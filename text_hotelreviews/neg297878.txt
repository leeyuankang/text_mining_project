on day breakfast was abysmal i had to ask for almost everything the person on the breakfast area did not fill up at all in the end i was embarrassed because i had to ask for so much and the female attending had a bit of an attitude problem bread was low all end bits she was argumentative melon only one type there just came to the stage that i couldn t ask anymore no butter apparently on day they didn t have individual packets one had to ask and it would have been cut handy if one had been informed in advance orange juice only had dregs i asked for ham this had also run out so she brought beef then proceeded to use the fish fork to put some on my plate needless to say i didn t have any she needs training and an attitude transplant
