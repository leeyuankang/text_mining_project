no cooked breakfast available we weren t late but all that was left was a few beans and hash brown not clear why as we were initially told chef was cooking some more as they hadn t expected some many breakfasts needed then told that there was no gas and then told there had been an incident we were given complimentary drinks in the bar that evening and our breakfasts were deducted from the bill all a bit strange but could have been better communication
