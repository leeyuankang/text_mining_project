check in took a long time bathroom in the hotel room flooded when taking a shower we had to request reception to ask the room next door to quieten down at in the morning there were not enough breakfast tables in the morning for breakfast so we ended up eating in the bar and in addition there was not enough food and we had to wait over mins before anything in the buffet was replenished
