we were very disappointed by a policy that was not evident to us upon booking the room six months ahead of time the rate on an individual night varies by as much as to pounds per night dependent solely on the discretion of the hotel itself it was explained to me by reception that it varies solely on how busy they are not on the rate that i thought was locked in upon reserving a room i would not book here again simply because of a lack of transparency
