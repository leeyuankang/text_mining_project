i asked twice for a surprise for my partner to be put in the room prior to our arrival once via email and over the call i was told by the chef he would display a small selection of cakes with a good luck message for my partner for the marathon he said this would be sorted out for me and when we arrived into the room there was nothing there i was very disappointed considering i had requested this twice and revived nothing
