the hotel itself is quite small inside there is an intricate system of narrow corridors be ready to encounter steps on your way to the room executive suits are far better than superior ones my last superior suit had a weird smell in it something like antiseptics which was surprising but not critical the furniture was also older and a more worn out though the bed was as good as in the executive one besides it has a shower cabin while executive suits have bath tubes
