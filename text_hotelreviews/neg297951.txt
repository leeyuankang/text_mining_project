the parking situation was awful they had limited parking and had none available on the day i was staying i asked to cancel my booking and be refunded due to this and i was refused instead i was told i could park on a nearby housing estate between the hours of hence it left me having to vacate the hotel to move my car at in the morning with no where to move it to it was awful and staff were very unhelpful
