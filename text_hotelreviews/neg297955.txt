however we had contacted the hotel the day before we checked in to enquire whether we arrive earlier and park the car so that we could look around greenwich before checking in this was agreed and we had even agreed an eta unfortunately when we did arrive the car park was full and we were unable to park instead we were told to park on the meters at for every five minutes up to a maximum of two hours in the end we managed to drive around and find some unrestricted parking which we then used until we returned in the early evening to check in
