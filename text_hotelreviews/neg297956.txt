it was a downstairs room next to the kitchen dinning area it was noisy there was a pillar in the middle of the room which is odd specially for hilton some works were carried out and hence corridors were not exactly what i d expect for food was not great either the environment was bit grumpy and may not be most interesting for young professionals another disadvantage was location far from central london
