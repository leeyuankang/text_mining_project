my corridor was being painted during the day which was a little inconvenient but not a massive drama given the price of the room and not really being central greenwich i thought the parking was expensive at i got charged for two days even though i d only parked for one this was corrected again given the price of the room i d expect better tea and coffee and a little more choice on the in room tea front gym isn t very well equipped so if you need a hotel with a gym go somewhere else
