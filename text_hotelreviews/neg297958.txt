the breakfast was ridiculously over priced we were charged each for the tiny bottles of water which we found in our room the hotel took a holding charge but didn t explain that they were going to do this when i asked about it the man at reception rudely told me that all guests were told this therefore implying that we were lying we also weren t offered a breakdown of the charges on our room when we checked out in other hotels i have stayed in i have automatically been given an itemized bill to check and sign at the end of my stay some of the service was also slow i think a lot of this was down to staff being new but the guy at reception was rude
