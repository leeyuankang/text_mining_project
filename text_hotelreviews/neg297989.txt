they lost one of my two bookings as a result of changing computer systems hours before arrival what should have been a simple check in procedure became a mammoth wait at the check in desk it meant one of my brothers had to wait a long time before he could get access to his room they were apologetic and assured me that they would resolve all issues before check out i also specifically went to the hotel to give them the bank debit card that i wanted both rooms to be charged to as they wrote to me to say the credit card i had given on booking needed a third party authorisation as i was not staying at the hotel they then pre authorised my debit card and gave me a receipt and confirmed all charges would be put on this debit card however the next morning my brother was asked to pay for the rooms on his card he told them i had provided my debit card somehow they lost my card s pre authorisation so finally they decided to charge the rooms to the credit card i had given as a guarantee on the initial booking form but which they previously stated they could not accept hopefully they will get a grip on their systems
