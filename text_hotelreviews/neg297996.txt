parking is too expensive and the bar is very pricey also unless you re travelling with someone you re very comfortable with the bathroom will be a problem it s not an en suite per se it s more part of a room with a sliding door over it said door has a large gap that you can see right through wasn t a problem for us but may be awkward for a twosome who are friends or relatives
