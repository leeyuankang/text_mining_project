when i arrived at the hotel they gave my room to some one else and it was already paid by me they gave me a smaller room for a night then moved me to my room but they took the charge for the big room for all the nights as well i kept my card holder in my bag at the room in the hotel when i came back i didnt find it when i told the hotel they did nothing even the managers who works there aneta they tell as that we will do our best for the first mistake and the second one and they did nothing and this is the worst hotel in london
