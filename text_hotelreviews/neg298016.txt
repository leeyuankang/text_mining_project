pretty much everything else very very small room no usb socket i had to charge my phone from the back of the tv paper thin walls i could hear all the conversations from the next room duvet and pillows were thin cheap polyester no space or flat surface to put things on any useful space was taken up by large lamps a tiny room does not need two table lamps and a floor lamp the hairdryer cord wouldn t stretch to the mirror as the sockets are in the wrong place just basic design faults food was mediocre poor parking facilities i did tell the receptionist when i checked out but he wasn t really interested definitely would not stay here again or recommend it poor value for money
