the fitness facilities were apparently under maintenance for the whole of my trip which was four days i asked everyday and was told it would be fixed my the next day this did not materialise i chose this hotel because it had the fitness equipment also so for it not to be available for the whole of my stay and to be told it would be fixed everyday is extremely disappointing
