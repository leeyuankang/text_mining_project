do not try resting during the day here as the housekeeping staff love nothing more than slamming doors it s absolutely insane seriously they have a job to do that s understood but the hour they took cleaning rooms near mine the amount of times doors were slamming was ridiculous it was like an angry teenager was in the place slamming doors so hard it shook my door as well this went on for the entire two days shame really as it is lovely here
