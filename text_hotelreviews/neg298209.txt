i ve stayed before however this room was tiny you literally couldn t swing a cat it was also on the lg floor which was a total faff as due to a wedding we couldn t use the lift so not only were we inconvenienced on getting to the room we then had noise no mini bar so had to order room service for small soft drinks and we were charged i will not be returning a shame as this was a return visit as my first was better but perhaps i was upgraded previously
