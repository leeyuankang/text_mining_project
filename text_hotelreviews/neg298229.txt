we didn t like the see through bathroom door very bizarre it was a small twin room and the bathroom was right opposite the beds we had to hide around the corner when one of us was in the loo or shower also it was a sliding door which didn t really shut properly so absolutely no privacy or soundproofing the bathroom is the reason why i won t be staying in a mercure again which is a shame as apart from that it s a fab hotel
