i love cooked breakfast the only time i eat one is in hotels this one had no flavour i am used to quality bacon and tasty eggs but this breakfast had neither bread was good and a good selection of other choices unfortunately they also continuously ran out of mugs and eggs etc they topped up things that didn t require it but left people waiting for other items
