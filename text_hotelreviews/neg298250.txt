we weren t really greeted when we arrived which was late and so we were weary and a friendly greeting wouldn t have gone a miss we had trouble with our access cards to our room the bathroom door was frosted glass which was not appropriate for a twin room and made the stay a little uncomfortable and awkward to say the least the view from the window was awful and we could hear the loud a c outside our window when we opened it which was annoying
