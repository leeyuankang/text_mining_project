requested room near lift and they assumed i was disable and had walk in shower but room was on gf by reception too noisey staff quickly changed for me which i was grateful however as i entered the room it had unpleasant smell as the bathroom toilet had no ventilation bedroom also was blocked off with brickwall which was depressing disappointed as last stay i was extremely pleased hope they don t only treat first time guests well gym was basement and as you enter the floor it smells of heavy dampness gym treadmill inclined but couldn t come back down tv worked immitenently but no sound
