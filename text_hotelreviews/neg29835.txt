room service menu very disappointing i hear that s common but the pizza was absolutely gross the film choice on the tv was ridiculous there were about choices in each category and very expensive if i d thought about it i d have brought my laptop and got a film online but it wasn t really a problem because there was the tv anyway the sauna and steam room were nice and clean a hot tub would be a nice addition all in all i loved it and would stay again i think it was a little expensive but probably no more so than other london hotels so i have no comparison in terms of value for money
