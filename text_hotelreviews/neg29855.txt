glass bathroom door if you get up during the night the whole room is flooded with light my beauty sleep was disturbed greatly reduced privacy as the door is not completely frosted over curtains too high not easy to draw them together staff were good except for one member who struggled with the concept that speed doesn t equal efficiency poor lighting for reading in bed sorry hotel but on balance we probably will not be staying again
