our bed was actually two single beds pushed together which was ok but a little awkward when rolling over in the night our shower head also sprayed water all over the bathroom but when we mentioned this to the staff they fixed it for us very quickly only thing that could be improved would maybe be having a mini fridge to keep bottles of water etc but this wasn t a big issue
