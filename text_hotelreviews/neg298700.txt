like i mentioned the hotel is fairly new so little glitches are expected we had some issues with the original room we booked bathroom lights and air conditioning we understand that some things still need to be checked and fixed but it does not invalidate our experience the staff promptly solved the problem moving us to a much better room i think it is one of the best rooms i ve ever stayed in althow i mentioned all this in the did not like session i think it might be a positive point since we were not disappointed at all with our stay and i can t think of another thing i didn t like
