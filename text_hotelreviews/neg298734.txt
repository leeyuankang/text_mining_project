room was not soundproofed could here everything in the dance studio at a very early hour really not good but apparently this is being done very soon couldn t open the window in standard room however this was rectified by being moved and very kindly upgraded to a superior room which had a balcony outside area views from room not that great no breakfast option no room service no spa facilities apparently there will be a wellness centre which would complete it facilities in room basic for example shower cap refreshments no mini bar etc poor choice of tea coffee where are your good coffee machines
