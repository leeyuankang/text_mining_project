the room has light motion sensor in corridor and bathroom which is a bit annoying that the light goes on every time you go to bathroom at night and stays on for a while as the hotel is very new without the constant flow of customers yet the room was a bit dusty felt like it was prepared couple of days in advance the hotel is related to dance studios so in my room i experienced noise from the dance classes however manager of the hotel was very considerate of my inconvenience and promised that this situation is going to be resolved with isolation of the dance studio in due time overall nice hotel with amazing stuff but still needs time to get ready for customers for example i did not find a hair drier in my room this is kind of inappropriate for the stars hotel
