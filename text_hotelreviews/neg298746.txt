we stayed for nights in this so called hotel and i am quite disappointed they did not change the bed linen after the previous guest it was dirty and had hair on it the cups were dirty as well and the room was in dust the napkin box was empty we asked for clean bed sheets and we had to change them ourselves at midnight although the reception guys promised that the next day they will make sure to clean the room and change the bed linen and the cups but guess what the next day we came to the hotel room and nothing has been changed they did not change the bed linen they just took away the new bed sheets which we got from reception guys to somehow spend the first night the cups were dirty from the previous guest and the room in dust besides that the windows were locked and we were not able to air the room they are newly opened hotel and they definitely need to improve their service i had the impression that i have stayed in a cheap hostel but not in a hotel
