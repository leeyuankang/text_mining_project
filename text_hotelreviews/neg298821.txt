the tv and menu system was so slow it was actually painful the gym was more of a token gesture and not up to scratch to get to the gym you have to use a crappy service elevator at the far end of the hotel which made a poor experience even worse on arrival we were offered an upgrade to a room with a view but this came at extra cost to be honest they weren t busy and outside our window was a building site as such i think they really should have given us a complimentary upgrade as it wouldn t have cost them anything besides the room they were going to upgrade us to was exactly the same as the room we stayed in it was just overlooking the water instead of a building site the hotel is quite a way out of town and taxis are around gbp to get to central london depending on traffic
