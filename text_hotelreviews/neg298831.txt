the air conditioning i have stayed probably times in the last months first time i insisted on moving rooms now i don t bother asking as no room i have been in for the past times has working aircon on top of that you cannot open the windows a tip for visitors is to shell out the extra for a marina view with a balcony or any room with a balcony then at lest you will be able to open the doors
