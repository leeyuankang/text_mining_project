we stayed here for our wedding night was a lovely hotel check in staff were great my husband left his wedding ring at the hotel in our room by the coffee machine he phoned the hotel and they were adamant they didn t find it he continuously rang them was put on hold for half hour at a time kept advising they didn t find the ring when my husband said he was going to take things further they said they will ring him back surprise surprise we got a call back to say the ring had been found in the bed linen the bed and the coffee machine were in seperate rooms and the ring didn t go anywhere near the bedroom so for it to be found in the bed linen is quite strange in the waste bin yes more understandable one of the cleaners had come across a beautiful expensive wedding ring and thought theyd pocket it when the hotel manager realised we weren t gonna leave it they found the ring miraculously
