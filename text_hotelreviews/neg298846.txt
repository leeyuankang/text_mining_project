they charged for parking my car although i have a disabled badge and they never told me this when i arrived they just said park over there they also charge for a z bed for my year old grand daughter thats a rip off when the room was already they credited the after a row on the booking com page for the hotel it says children under five stay free but have since written to say that they only stay free when in the same bed i am sure booking com bookings get given the worst rooms the hotel is also quite tired in places there was a hole in a wall the ceiling in the shower was grubby and the decoration was tired for a five star a night room they also used to give a bowl of fruit in the rooms which i see has now stopped the hotel is not as good as it was i m afraid i have stayed there many times now and have seen it deteriorate
