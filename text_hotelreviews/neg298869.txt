i didn t like the way the staff was looking down on me and my partner as if we weren t suppose to say that it was clearly because we were young and black and didnt dress the way everyone else did i remember asking someone where the pool was and they were looking at us funny asking us if we were even staying at the property well obviously if i am asking were the pool is and he then went on to say yes the pool is open to residents only it just wasn t a nice experience checking in or out sort it out we are in black people are allowed in these sort of places honey
