a disappointment we stayed here before which is why we chose to come back for my partners birthday however this time it was so disappointing to say the least we made the hotel aware that it was a special occasion as last time they gave us a lovely bottle of wine and chocolates however this time we got nothing not even a note they put us in a room what stunk of cigarette smoke so we asked to be moved but they tried to fob us off by just spraying the room however this didn t help the smell so we got moved rooms finally i then wanted to relax and have a bath but the bath wouldn t fill properly and every time it was running the plug would open letting the water out so i gave up and ended up just having a shower we also went to get drinks at the bar which took over minutes to arrive and may i add it was dead so no reason to take this long we did make the lady at the reception aware of this and she fobed us off with of our bar tab which we still got short changed for and the breakfast was okay but for just poached eggs on toast at it s rather excessive overall won t be staying here again and will find elsewhere
