bathroom floor very dusty looked like builders dust room decor marked and a little tired also unless you read the hotel manual in detail you wouldn t have known that you are not to drink the water out of the taps due to a softener system wasn t made aware of this at check in and only provided with a small bottle of drinking water not what i d expect in this type of establishment and for what we paid breakfast superb but over priced
