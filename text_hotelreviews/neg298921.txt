the standard of service in the bar and restaurant was very poor at this visit two rounds of drinks were spilt over myself and my guests and the situation was handled poorly the most appalling issue was that a guest was allowed to bring her large dog into the dining area of the bar no problem with that but was then allowed to produce a large bowl and proceeded to mix and prepare the dogs food standing at the dining table for two minutes and then to feed the dog next to the table this was in full view of all in the bar my guests fellow diners and the bar and restaurant staff
