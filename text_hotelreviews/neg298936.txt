we were two couples who arrived for breakfast and having sat there for half an hour quickly concluded the chaos that was coming out of the kitchen tea coffee were being delivered to the wrong tables and the orders placed from the menu were either not met or took an unacceptable amount of time to come to the table the waiter took a long time to come to our table and take our order fortunately we were not in a rush but this was not a pleasant experience the restaurant wasn t that busy which didn t actually explain things i don t normally respond to these sort of views but if i could score for the breakfast separately i would give the food was good but the whole experience of just sitting there was an absolute shambles and overlooked the quality of the food when it eventually arrived
