it took half an hour to check me in as they struggled to find a room for me that was ready this was in the evening they did not have the room type i had booked suite with harbour view and balcony i was given a suite with no balcony and a view of office buildings at the rear the heating did not work and the room was cold at i was given a small electric fan heater instead which was not sufficient and noisy all pat testing on the room appliances was at least years out of date
