our room was on the mezzanine so other rooms might be different but the walls were very thin if a neighbouring room had their television on or indulged in nocturnal activity it sounds like they are in your room it s so loud i felt as a new couple the glass door with gap where the glass panels meet on the ensuite bathroom was a little embarrassing you could see and hear everything from the bathroom
