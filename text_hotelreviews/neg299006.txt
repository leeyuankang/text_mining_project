very poor response time from front desk and service personale when issues arose we were a party of and had reserved two rooms waited exceptionally long time for room nr to be ready had to leave just before to meet w family and room nr was still not available waited for delivery of luggage turns out they could not locate it misplaced it and we actually had to go down and help the staff find it after a long wait and repeated inquiries to front desk they delivered bags to our room but they were not ours they had delivered some else s bags had to go down and identify our bags the whole process was needless to say inconvenient and took a very long time with a five year old and a small baby that needed changing this was not the best way to start our stay in london
