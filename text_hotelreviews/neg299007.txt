on route i took a call to say there had been an issue with booking com and we had no room they offered us a room at chelsea fc not a patch on what we were expecting no thanks we insisted on a similar hotel they found one then out of the blue a room at the chelsea h became available very strange it took all morning to sort this out so it tainted our stay very strange goings on
