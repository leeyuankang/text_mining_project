not all executive rooms are the same we stayed here for nights at an executive room via booking com it was in the new wing the room was large quiet street behind and well appointed but the shower cubicle leaked and even after informing reception they were unable to fix it we checked out travelled and booked an executive room again on booking com for another four nights this time we were in the old wing and the room was half the size of the executive suite in the new wing it was also noisy and we could hear the footsteps of the guest in the adjoining room we asked for a room change for new wing but they said they were full considering we had just given then room nights the effort could have been a bit keener to put us in the new wing so we didn t feel we got our moneys worth the time around for guests staying in the new wing and who are carrying large suitcases staff should inform guests that its best to get help with luggage as the corridors to the new wing goes up and down steps and levels and can be arduous especially after a long flight
