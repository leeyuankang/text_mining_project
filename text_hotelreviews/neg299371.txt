i had no idea my suite was on two floors which was a pain as i have recently had a hip replacement the fruit in the room was not ripe the grapes in particular were very bitter a common problem though in many hotels also it was very awkward to switch off all lights when going to bed as master switch does not operate all of them also there should a master switch at bedside as it is a duplex spa not attended and masseuse did not know how to operate massage table which surprised me i was also over charged however promptly refunded after pointing this out
