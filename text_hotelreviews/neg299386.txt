the hotel was in a fair location but a bit far from the main metro line so if you plan to be there for days be ready to walk every day km from and to the metro station there is another one closer hospital clinic but it was a bit less useful for us there were some weird noises in the room which we could not determine from where nothing very disturbing just weird seemed like some problem with the pipes not much natural light at least in the room we were we found the bed very hard and had trouble to sleep for the four days we were there
