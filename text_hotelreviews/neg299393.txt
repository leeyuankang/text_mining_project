no kettle so no tea and coffee in the room other than if you are happy to purchase at bar downstairs room was very small so we slept by the door and could hear everything happening outside the room not great if you like to slepp a bit longer until as you will be woken up by doors being slammed by other hotel visitors no door closers on the entrance room doors so the doors make a lot of noise tiled floor finish in corridors great for keeping the flors clean but acoustics are crazy so can hear everything rooms are not star size
