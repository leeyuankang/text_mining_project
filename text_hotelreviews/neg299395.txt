really small room with very few spaces to deposit your clothes not a suitable stay for more than nights in my opinion i found the sugar opened and i left it like that on purpose to see when they will change it they never did i threw away myself the rubbish and only after that they replaced the sugar limescale on the shower i recommend to the cleaning management to keep the shower tops hours in vinegar in order to remove the limescale otherwise having a shower is annoying unpleasant view but i could deal with it as i did not spend too much time in the room bidet provided but no towel provided for it no toilet brush provided not a proper cover for duvet tv placed in the corner not easy to watch it from the bed no mirror provided in the room when choosing my room i have decided for double twin room option and i am pretty sure they gave me a basic double room which is a lower price and quality option i don t like to go back and argue with members of staff what should i get and what not i thought that is understandable from the beginning i have been asked on my preference about the bed and i chose a double one because i travelled with my partner but if you choose twin beds option you get a bigger room make sure that you get what you pay for
