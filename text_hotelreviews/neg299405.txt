because we had a late check in they put us in a basic room instead of a twin room for what we paid extra the worst is that they insisted that it is a twin room the problem is that the twin room is almost double the size of the basic room and cannot be mistaken and because there were some strange noises coming from the pipes of the ac we demanded to be moved and on the next day we finally got our twin room next time don t try to lie the shower in both rooms was not working very fluently there is no full size mirror in the room and generally the pictures shown are lying about the room size the rooms are smaller than they look
