we left our luggage to the reception staff to be stored until being able to enter the room and our backpack was stolen with all our personal items in it i luckily saved my id and a credit card but everything else was stolen by another guest at the hotel we assume cause they haven t told us anything else so far first reaction from people at the reception was to tell us that we did not leave the backpack to be stored in the luggage room with them and that we never entered it to the hotel later they checked the camera in the reception and they could confirm that we indeed had the backpack with our other luggage in the reception and that we left it there to be put in the luggage room even though we were reimbursed the full price of our booking the trouble that we went through and all the things that we lost can t be compensated
