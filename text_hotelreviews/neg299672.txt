there was a problem with my breakfast reservation i reserved it after the hotel so that might have been a problem to their system before i went to the hotel i called to make sure it was added to my reservation i was told it is sorted it wasn t at check in i was told it is sorted it wasn t in the morning when i showed up for breakfast i was told that my name isn t on the list and i have no breakfast reservation obviously it wasn t sorted but i have the feeling this is booking s mistake not the hotel s
