cleaning not really done or half done i had a room for smokers with no ashtray to be found in the whole hotel plus even a person who smokes does not appreciate sleeping in a room where they previously smoked gavin these rooms with the smallest balcony would have made them smokers friendly in deed i booked mainly because they have the option of booking a transfer and i wasn t feeling adventurous in finding a taxi in the middle of the night but no one showed up to pick me up so much later i had to taxi eventually a taxi so for me that service is non existent in the array of services provided for the price paired there were plenty of other cheaper options
