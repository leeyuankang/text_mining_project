there was no air con because as the receptionist explained it was spring time and air con was too expensive to run however the temperatures were in the early and it was muggy i only slept for a couple of hours each night because the room was like a sweat box opening the window was as bad as it opened the room up to the traffic sounds from two of barcelona s main dual carriageways traffic did not lessen during the night the bed was uncomfortable when one considers the point of a hotel is achieve a good nights sleep whilst travelling this was something of a disastrous stay from our perspective
