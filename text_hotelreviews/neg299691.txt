they do not turn on the air conditioning until the end of march if the room is hot you have to open a window and hear the sounds of heavy city traffic one day they forgot to make up the room we had to ask them to do so the breakfast room is in the basement with no windows however the buffet breakfast was decent but the same every day there is no restaurant and no bar to purchase a glass of wine or a mixed drink call your own taxi to and from the airport if the hotel does it for you it will cost you much more we left early for the airport and seeing we had pre purchased breakfasts we asked for a breakfast pack it was a single cold cut sandwich without any condiment and an apple no water beverage or anything else that was really bad by the way they charge your credit card for your full stay immediately upon booking if you are unhappy and want to leave for any reason you will be stuck with paying the full amount of your stay overall i would not rate the barcelona eurostars monumental as a hotel worthy of its star rating it is expensive for what it is i would not stay there again unfortunately it was not a positive experience
