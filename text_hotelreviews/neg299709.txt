the room had a weird odor to it the kind of smell from an air conditioner that has accumulated mildew or mold it was noticeable only when we walked into the room after being outside for a while the shower door was a bit impractical i noticed the new design in europe is to install a glass shower door that only shields half the length of the bathtub if the shower head is in a different position it is very easy for water to spray out and all over the floor we had water puddles every day which was annoying since we had three people in my group
