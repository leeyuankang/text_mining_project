we booked through booking com when we checked into the hotel at we established there was no family room booking just a booking for two adults i had the confirmation of a booking for four people the hotel managed to squeeze us in a small not very pleasant room we had a room for the night but we wouldn t have bothered booking for a room of that standard it was my daughters birthday the next morning so the whole experience wasn t great the hotel said they did their best in the circumstances
