hotel needs renovation this is no way a star hotel it s massively overpriced located next to major main roads and an elementary school be prepared for noisy nights and mornings walls are also very thin and there is no real door isolation so whenever someone leaves or arrives at their room you notice it quite well neighbourhood is not a particulary nice or lively one
