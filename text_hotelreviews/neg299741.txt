the ac was not working during all my stay the room was very hot and humid i had to open the window all night which brought a lot of street noise it was very unacceptable as i paid a big amount of money to end up in a hotel that provides air conditioning also their profile on booking con says property is air conditioned very misleading and annoying also i was provided twin beds stuck together rather than the queen bed i requested which was very uncomfortable
