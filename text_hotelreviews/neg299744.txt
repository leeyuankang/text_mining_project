the bed was the hardest thing i have ever slept on not firm just hard and the pillows were dreadful no tea or coffee making facilities and if you wanted a cuppa you had to run down to reception and wait for someone to be free to make a cup at a pop with price paid i would have expected better room service menu was of a particular genre and couldn t really disguise itself as a meal you would have been hungry hours later room was beside the lift and therefore we had noise everytime someone used the lift on the upper floors balcony was nice to have paid for that but could have had cushion available for chair or lounger location was ok only min walk to segrada familia but for most other things you had to travel
