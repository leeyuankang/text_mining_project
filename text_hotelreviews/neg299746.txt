not sure how spanish hotel ratings are provided but this hotel should be more of stars at the very best the furnishings are worn out there are no carpets in the room the wooden floor are well worn and requires polarising to bring it up to a decent standard toilet seat is broken and the shower drainage is blocked had to shover in the poodle of dirty water reported to staff who got a plumber in but problem persisted throughout my stay i was very glad to leave after my days stay ac centrally controlled which means presently only option in rooms are heating which you could turn off it can get pretty warm at night and your only option is to open your windows another thing to beware of is that this hotel will charge your card for full amount on booking com you cannot modify or cancel booking as you lose full amount paid for practically you are locked down to this booking so although it might say reserve there is a tiny blueprint where it clearly states this in this case it was an oversight on my part as my other bookings on booking com which states reserve only will allow free cancellation up until ours before your booked date
