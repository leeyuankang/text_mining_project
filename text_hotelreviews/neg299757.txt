wifi did not work at all i emphasise again no wifi in the room you must go down stairs to the lobby to have wifi access the room was extremely hot and was impossible to adjust the air condition even when we turned the air condition completely off it was still the same coffee was not good at all but otherwise the breakfast was ok
