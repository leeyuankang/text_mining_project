at first i thought i was walking into a bar not a welcoming layout however the concierge was very pleasant booked executive twin room told room ready at check in however set up as double had to go to reception twice offered another room which i had to view with a member of staff didn t like this room the first room was changed by a maintenance man while we were unpacking bathroom had glass fronted sliding door with no ventilation which rattled when opening very curious given the decor of the room and which must have been designed by a contortionist the room was not what i would call executive very disappointed
