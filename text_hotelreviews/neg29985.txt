the girl at the reception wasn t very welcoming had to ask for a change of the room due to the fact that it was very small and much smaller than the other rooms in the same category plus it looked very old the main heater wasn t working and kept a msg for them to check and fix while i went out for hours and came back to find the room freezing and heater is not working asked for portable heaters as the room was freezing
