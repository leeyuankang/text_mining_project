our jacuzzi ended up getting a lot of expanding foam pumped into it i assume due to a leak we weren t aware of being expanding foam it expanded quite a bit and was a bit of a trip hazard as it was right before the steps a note or something to let us know this had been carried out it was still soft when we got back to the room in the evening as we weren t sure if we should use it still would have been appreciated
