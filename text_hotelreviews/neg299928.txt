after hours we arrived having missed a night s sleep the hotel does not seem to allow early check in at all as we were not the only guests falling asleep in the lobby exactly at the stated check in we were given keys to our room we had asked if they could clean our room first but they seemed uninterested in doing so i won t stay here again
