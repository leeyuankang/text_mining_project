my room was dirty and i was afraid to walk barefoot on the floor which looked as if it was not cleaned in weeks white furniture which looked nice in pictures was dirty too and the door looked like it was attacked by an angry dog my shower drain was clogged and the staff did not respond to my request to clean it on a day with heavy rainfall a pretty common occurrence in amsterdam the roof in my room was leaking luckily not on the bed you could also see signs of earlier water damage i also saw insects running on the floor overall the second floor of the property looked dirty and badly kept on top of all of this a repairman who came to fix something in a room next door at midnight was very noisy as were many of the guests i understand the challenges of running a hotel in an old building but this negligence is inconsistent with prices demanded by the hotel on the last night after i complained about water damage the night shift manager offered to move me to a different room but that offer came pretty late around midnight when i was already in bed and ready to sleep
