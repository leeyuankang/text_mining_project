for this price this hotel totally lacks comfort and everytime it feels like for a price of everything is tired and old if you are staying not one the top floors you will have a very small windows overlooking a wall you will be followed by strange technical sounds everytime you visit bathroom you will experience problems with your key cards times in days which will led you to reception and no excuses or explanations followed the bar and restaurant here are extemely uncomfortable and uninvinting breakfast costs pounds for a very simple staff and a long queue for omlet station with one lazy person here juice is very chemical and totally awful i suggest going anywhere around you will get a fresh breakfast for pounds tried a laundry here but they never helped with the stuff on my trousers solved that with only one laundry at home the funny thing on top of all of this is a broken cheap hairdryer from s would recommend to find another hotel as there is much to choose from in that area
