the little details just weren t up to scratch had we been staying more than one night i would have complained towels had threads running so they looked and felt old and tatty we had to request robes for the room which were listed as being included only one sheet of note paper was left on the pad next to the phone and no pen here either despite the indentation in the stand staining that looked like coffee drops on the bedding edges of the blinds were very tatty as they are old and worn some channels on the tv had no sound the hairdryer was left in the drawer with the back broken we managed to replace the back ourselves to ensure safe usage of the plug sockets in the room were unusable none of these things on their own is a significant issue but the collection of small things definitely ended up having a negative impact on our experience we were waiting for things to go awry or be less than perfect nb this was all in a room we were moved to after having initially been placed next to the lift shaft with the constant racket of the motor kicking in
