the bath clearly had not been cleaned from previous guest as there was a ring of dirt and hair around the bath the bed was large and comfortable but the sheets did not fit properly and became uncomfortable during the night i also informed the hotel i required non feather pillows but only of the pillows on the bed had been replaced the bar lounge shut relatively early and there was a lack of suitable space for guests arriving from america at midnight to relax and get together to plan the next day breakfast was good but very overpriced
