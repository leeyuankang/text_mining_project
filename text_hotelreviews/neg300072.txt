we stayed in a room with two double beds family of children aged and beds were far too soft ended rolling together and aching back too many large scatter cushions with no where to put them except the floor making an obstacle course bathroom far too small for four people and no where to hang towels looked like someone had tried to open the glazing to open a window in order to smoke as the glazing was loose and cigarette ash between glazing and window sill good breakfast but thought the set up of large dinning room felt like a residential home for the elderly
