the suite we got was a very good room the bed was very good the sheets were very nice the down side was the noise from the lift all night it felt like were in the lift shaft the hotel is very good and i am sure not all the rooms would have this noise just a shame we did our room was its a big shame about the sounds from the lift as this did spoil a very good room i am sure it could be sorted as never had that much noise even from much cheaper hotels
