when we arrived we was kept waiting to book in we was given an awful room which overlooked fenchurch st station platforms this was after i had emailed the hotel upon booking asking for a view i did manage to change the room with a very nice and helpful lady staff member which was perfect in the room we had one cup it took three staff members at different times to manage to get us a cup probably because they didn t speak much english we had two occasions where our key didn t work so had to come down from the floor to reception to get it re programmed not that impressed for the money however the room was exceptional with the view
