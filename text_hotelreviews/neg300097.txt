we arrived early to the hotel before check in we were told our room wasn t ready however we could check in pay and leave our bags we came back an hour later to get our room key which i thought was going to be pretty straight forward the lady at reception said that our room had been taken and she was looking for another room slightly disappointed the fact i had already paid for my room to be told it had been taken and put in a different room
