no lounge bar area well there was a pub type thing with football on large tv s not really what you d expect for a star hotel i expect a relaxing lounge not a pub with tv disappointed that despite us informing of a special occasion and selecting the higher spec room was not a great view and there was no acknowledgement of the occasion for me i have stayed in star which felt more luxurious and special than this hotel ps dreadful hairdryer have had better at travelodge and that s saying something
