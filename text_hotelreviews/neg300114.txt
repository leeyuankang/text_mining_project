we returned at after running to find that our room hadn t been cleaned at all when all we wanted to do was to relax and recharge despite the fact that i reported this immediately i still had to explain again on check out the duty manager was very dismissive and claimed the most he could do was to apologise and waive the cost of breakfast he also promised to e mail with details to enable discount for a future stay i m still waiting for this e mail days later in addition breakfast is extortionate given the quality and the level of service i d definitely advise to give this hotel a miss
