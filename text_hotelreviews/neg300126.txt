stayed in room and the bed was a pull out bed which i find appalling as i paid for an executive room it was not comfortable and had a thin mattress the carpet was coming up at the join in the middle of the room and the hairdryer connection at the back of the draw when i pulled the draw out to get the hairdryer to work was aweful the cleanliness of the bathroom could have been better too as there was dirt in some places
