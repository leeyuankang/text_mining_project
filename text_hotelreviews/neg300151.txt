all exec rooms were described to have a guaranteed view of tower bridge or the city as written in the guest information guide mine had a view of the rear courtyard moved to a higher floor view still overlooking same area but better but room not as nice as original makes me wonder if it was an exec room i was moved to apart from that would recommend
