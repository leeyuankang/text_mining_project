felt very let down was my wife s birthday made the hotel aware of this also booked an executive double room at nice room but very small bathroom was so small only one of us at a time could fit in there free water has been stopped and the name of the the bar i think is very very inappropriate in the currant climate the isis bar really like i said stayed here many times before but won t be again i did make my point known to the staff and was given a oh well kind of excuse
