unfortunately there were a few things that need improvements upon arriving the receptionists could not locate our invitation although we presented our booking confirmation maybe that s why the room included only towels when we just arrived and no floor mat for the bathroom the bed was really really uncomfortable and both of us suffered back pains no refrigerator in the room no hair dryer and minimal toiletries soap bar and shampoo no conditioner body lotion and so on food is reasonable not enough vegetables and bad coffee we selected the holiday inn thinking we can add this stay to our holiday inn card unfortunately we found out that it cannot be added when ordering through booking com
