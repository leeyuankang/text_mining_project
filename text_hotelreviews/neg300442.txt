conditioner there wasn t any also shampoo was not very good i understand why they have hangers without hooks in the closets but it would have been nice if i could have transferred one to the bathroom each morning instead i had to take my clothes off the hanger and place them on the counter while i showered worse the night before our flight we went to arrange a cab to the airport the guy at the counter said they had a fixed rate and would arrange it the next morning it was not a cab but a car service it was not clean the car smelled like the driver had been smoking in it with the windows rolled up and the ashtray was never cleaned also he didn t take credit cards and we didn t know this until we were at the airport we didn t have any cash because all the london cabs take credit cards
