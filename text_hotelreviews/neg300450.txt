we dined a few times in the hotel restaurant in the early evening the quality of the food was excellent however the wait staff in the evening was completely off they charged the wrong price didn t come to take our order until we got up and asked brought the wrong food never apologized and were generally resentful and disorganized this is in stark contrast to the staff at breakfast which is friendly and competent
