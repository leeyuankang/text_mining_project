room was small even for a standard double bed and with the desk that had been provided there wasn t enough room for bed side cabinets tables meaning no convenient place to put books watch water and other stuff within reach of the occupants also the bed side lamps didn t work one of the towels had a dirty mark on it at breakfast the hot food buffet repeatedly ran out of a number of the items and were not topped up in good time eg i waited over minutes for mushrooms and bacon the chef came over as not being happy and appeared to blame the customers for some reason not up to the standard we expect of holiday inn hotels
