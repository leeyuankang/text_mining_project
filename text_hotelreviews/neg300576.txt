the room was very small with no space to maneuver we were given a room at the far end with no view the room next to mine looked like some sort of storage and was spooky with the its door half open and no light there was noise from that room all night may as well be rats and we couldn t sleep well the hotel corridor was so narrow and overall it looked like a cheap student accommodation this is far poor standard for the value we paid
