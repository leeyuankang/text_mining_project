since my last visit the quality of the food has deteriorated the bread was very poor as was the cheap butter and preserves breakfast was poor really very little choice and nasty pastries from a cheap supermarket it seemed with waitrose just round the corner a better quality of cereals fruit yogurts and bread and pastries should have been available we also had dinner and although edible again it was not as good and we were not given our hot main courses at the same time not professional at all it was disappointing
