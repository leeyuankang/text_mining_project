we found the front counter staff to be very neutral not friendly bit like drones the concierge guys were great however rooms were very basic no fridge for milk etc overall even for london bad value there are similar hotels with breakfast for less better hotels in the area for the same price the so called free wifi has many restrictions watch out you pay for decent speed you pay for multiple devices even if you switch off one etc
