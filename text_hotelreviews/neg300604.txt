the hotel was overpriced for what it was i remember staying many times at this hotel on business in the the room i had for this stay was much smaller than the ones i remembered and a member of staff confirmed my suspicion that the hotel had created more rooms by subdividing existing rooms this did not make me happy fortunately i was travelling alone had there been of us in the room it would have been very cramped
