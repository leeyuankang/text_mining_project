i have booked a standard room in a star chain hotel the room was extremely tiny and dark i asked to give normal room for what they provided very basic standard room saying it is an executive room for additional charge then when afterall i moved from tiny room to very basic standard room i found that flush in the toilet does not work properly bathroom was very dirty extremely poor breakfast the personnel never smile which is depressing this is definitely not a star hotel value for money is below zero
