i was really happy with my stay but if i were being picky i d say objects in the room like the hairdryer could have been a bit cleaner breakfast could have been better not a huge choice of fruit tea very stewed not a great bread selection i think guests expect a better these days but they did provide mineral water and normal sized glasses so that was a plus and breakast room was incredibly hot
