the wifi connection was appalling i had intended to watch a movie in the room but it was so poor that i had to abandon that idea also i found the room very basic with the tiniest of bathrooms so i did not feel that i got good value for money i felt that i could have got the same quality by staying at a travel lodge however i had slightly higher expectations from a holiday inn
