when i checked in the staff said he can not find my booking even required my id and booking reference he needed to call back to booking com and finally he said my booking name is massive it is not my first time to use booking com but the first time i had been told there was no such booking for me at the end he even typed wrong on my name but still wants me to sign on the agreement unbelievably
