our flight was very early the last day so we could not have the breakfast we d pay for in stead they suggested a service that we could have a bag of breakfast with us from the hotel to the airport however this breakfast was very bad compared to the buffet we d pay for it had only sandwiches with tuna juice and apples furthermore it was expensive to go with cab to heathrow airport in the morning
