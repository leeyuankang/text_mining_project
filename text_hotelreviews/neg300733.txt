no proper heating in my room i needed a portable heater at am however i was given profuse apologies and a discount next day it can happen the hotel did what it could more problematic the hotel needs to look at what wishes guests express i had explicitly asked for a very quiet room away from noisy lifts or cleaners stores but was first given a room directly opposite those facilities the hotel has been refurbished but rooms are all but soundproof
