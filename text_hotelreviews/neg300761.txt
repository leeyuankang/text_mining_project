rooms were small we had requested a room with two beds but got a small room with a double bed instead which was too small for two adults and two children the hotel requested that we had to pay for an upgrade to an executive room although we had clearly indicated preference for a standard room with two beds when booking the room and that room would have been perfectly ok for us unfortunately they did not have any such room available when we arrived at check in
