breakfast a little old fashioned for me personally for quid it was full english bacon eggs etc white sliced bread or greasy croissants no artisan bread nuts seeds avacodo there were berries but in a sticky sugary juice but there are so many alternatives for breakfast that if this offer isn t for you and breakfast was busy so plenty of people really like it within minutes walk there are plenty of alternative options
