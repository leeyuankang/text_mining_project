the breakfast this was like hell people queing for minutes to even get seated then fighting to get their hot food quicker the breakfast room is far too small for that big a hotel what sense makes a pancake makes when it takes minutes for one and there are people queing to have their food the coffee one was good the next cup was horrible we paid while at breakfast the recceptionist did cancel our door key so waiting for the full lift to get down and up again no apology from her the welcome also wasn t very welcoming
