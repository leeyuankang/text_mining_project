night duty manager when i arrived breakfast hadn t been included the receptionist included it adding to my bill i said i had booking which said total would b i said i was tired and would sort it later the night duty manager was very cheeky after refunding me as i walked away he said to two of his colleagues in a very loud voice oh my god it was not the responce that a manager should set for his employees never mind the paying customer might not be a great some to him but it is to me and i would assume most other people as for the breakfast itself it was the worse tasting fry up i have ever tasted and i said to the check out staff as i left who did offer me a breakfast refund which i declined i just wanted out of there
