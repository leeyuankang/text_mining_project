i stayed in a lot of mom and pop hotels on my trip all these places offered free wifi the one hotel i stay in that is a corporate company and they charge you for the wifi unless you use their downstairs cafe or join their members club ripoff travelers need wifi to connect with their families back home plus paying for what you pay for this hotel you should be able to do it it in the comfort of your over priced room the wifi isn t even cheap
