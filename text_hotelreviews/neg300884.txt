after checking in my daughter and i sat on our beds having a cold drink before going out in to central london we heard a noise outside our bedroom door and when i went to investigate people were walking through our door followed by a member of staff it appears that they had been given our room a twin bedded room not bedded room at reception they were promptly whisked away by the member of staff but not a pleasing start to our stay
