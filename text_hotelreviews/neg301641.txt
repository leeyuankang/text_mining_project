didn t love the shower not being with the bathroom and the bath was small i would expect bigger bath for a superior suite with a terrace for the money paid i paid extra for a suite with an outside terrace expecting this to be on the higher levels it was on the ground floor with high walls like a prison around which i didn t expect so we couldn t really enjoy the terrace rooftop pool was a complete let down my partner and i went up twice and it was full of topless women and because it s so small it was awkward and too personal i left within seconds unless there are only two people up there it s just too small to enjoy lounging by th pool
