the rooms where definitely not clean i got toilet paper in the toilet that was dirty i approached the reception to have it changed and told them the room wasn t clean still noting happens the glasses we had used the day before where not cleaned or removed ended up having many glasses in the room the pool was so dirty they didn t clean that area at all which is a shame since it s a nice place
