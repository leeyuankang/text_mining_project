soundproofing was not as good as hoped or advertised could hear a lot of what was going on in neighbouring rooms which is very much unwanted noise in my opinion the choice of an all white design means a very challenging environment for housekeeping and unfortunately the impression of cleanliness was not great probably no worse than most other hotel rooms in the world but in these rooms every speck was easily visible
