apart from the solarium there s not much in the way of facilities outside the room the bar is tiny and right at the hotel door not inviting and the balconies in the rooms look at other buildings it s that kind of area after all be warned that the rooftop pool is very small and shallow and the views are more buildings the nespresso coffee machine is a nice touch but as there s no milk and the cups are espresso cups it s no use for many guests
