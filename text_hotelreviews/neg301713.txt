the bath shower is in the same room as the bed getting in and out of the bath shower may be a problem for less agile older people the pool is more like a large hot tub and very shallow oh and your room number is on the floor in front of the door we took a while to find it toiletries are in a white container with a lid on them next to the sink took a while to find them as they are not near the bath shower
