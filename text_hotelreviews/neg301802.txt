this had been booked as a birthday present to end a two week trip around italy and it was an extremely disappointing stay on arrival staff were rude and did not greet us or welcome us to the hotel they made us feel uncomfortable and as if we were an unconvinced to their day we were not told about the facilities available within the hotel or shown the direction to the lifts or where our room would be when entering the room i was extremely disappointed with the dated decor and to discover that the wall paper was peeling off the wall and that they had attempted to stick it back on by using tape as a surprise my boyfriend had emailed to ask if they could supply us with sparkling wine and roses on arrival like in their pictures they did not respond and obviously did not acknowledge or prepare this for our arrival overall very disappointing
