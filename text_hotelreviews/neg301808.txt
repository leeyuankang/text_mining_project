had to change room once because the first floor room we got had basically a window foot from a wall it faced the garden which is the smoking area so with the window open it reeked excellent staff however who went out of their way to get us a new room which was excellent complete with balcony and all would have liked to know beforehand that the pride parade ended just outside the hotel it was nice and all but made it difficult to enjoy being in the room with the loud base for several hours
