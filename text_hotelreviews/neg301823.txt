on my visit three weeks prior i had been unable to sleep the first night on the second floor due to subway noise the next day i was moved to the quieter fifth floor and i booked and was verbally confirmed the same fifth floor room for my return visit i saw the front desk clerk type in my room reservation to the hotel s system when arrived at midnight for this visit the hotel claimed to have no record of my booking of the fifth floor room and again put me on the loud second floor as they were sold out once again i got very little sleep and the next day insisted on being compd for the first night speaking to the front desk manager and then the director of the hotel i was moved to the fifth floor on the second night and believed that i would not be charged for the first night the hotel did not deliver the room i had specifically reserved had cost me another night sleep and half day in milan due to exhaustion and i would not have returned to the hotel if i thought they were going to put me on the second floor when i checked out there was no record of a credit and when the front desk manager called the director he denied speaking to me about not paying for the first night a lie i ended up paying for only one night because they ran my bill before reaching the director i was so upset about the way this was handled that i forgot to mention that i definitely heard rats or mice several times in the walls during the second night i would never stay in this hotel again
