the hotel had no record of my reservation when i arrived they blamed a system conversion as the hotel is located on the subway the rumbling of the train kept me awake nearly the whole first night i was able to moved to a quieter room on the fifth floor and reserved this fifth floor room specifically for my scheduled return three weeks later which the hotel failed to honor
