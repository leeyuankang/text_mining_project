the room we stayed in could use a little renovation and cleaning the bathroom did not feel too clean and there were two faucets above the bathtub only one was working and also holes in the tile where the shower holder was placed before the minibar was a funny little box placed right next to the tv this did not cause any hardship but felt a bit out of place
