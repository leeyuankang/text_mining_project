the hotel is good but the staff is totally unprepared and disorganized the night before our checkout we asked for a late checkout the agent checked and confirmed the possibility however another desk agent wasn t informed about it and instead of communicating the mistake in time mistreated us and said the hotel was full we were forced to pack and checkout in a hurry and still had to tolerate his rudeness
