extremely disappointing stay my single room was minuscule bed and provided a shower room instead of the bathroom advertised on booking com the shower room was so small you could not sit on the toilet because of the shower directly in front the spa attendant did not speak english and couldn t answer my questions i could not go to the spa no soundproofing at all my neighbor took a bath at and it felt like the bathtub was filling in my room needless to say i could not sleep the normal rate of the room was night for an room but i felt like a class guest i got a last minute discount but had i known i would have gone to an ibis hotel and i would ve spent a better night sadly won t be coming there again
