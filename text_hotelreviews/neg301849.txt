the very heavy perfumed bodylotion soap and shampoo in the bathroom it was much more delicate in the spa though and more discrete was surprised so many guests in the spa had their smartphones in the spa photographing and making selfies over and over again that was odd and nothing i expected to see in a delicate spa had nothing to do with the spa facilities which was very nice though a bit disappointed about the hamam looked forward to try it but there wasn t any staff there maybe because of the time we visit the spa friday evening
