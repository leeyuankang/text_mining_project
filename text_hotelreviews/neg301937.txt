aircon did not work properly and it was very hot during our stay resulting in awful sleep during our stay room so very small and outdated for this type of hotel bed was very small and extremely uncomfortable and far too old tv had a very bad picture bar fridge was not cold and could not even open the door fully as it was blocked by the bed not good value for money
