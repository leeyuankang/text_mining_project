the decor was a little dated and there wasn t a great range of complimentary teas in the room the spa was nice but you couldn t really describe the pool as a swimming pool as it was too small to take more than two strokes the breakfast was dissapointing a lot of the food was prepackaged and there wasn t a great selection
