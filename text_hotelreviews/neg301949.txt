as i said it was all almost perfect we were a bit surprised though finding that the superior room was located in the first floor facing the trafficated avenue that means noise all day we thought that you could provide thicker windows better noise isolation from the outside renovate the bathroom style is old like if it was beautiful years ago but now is a bit outdated beside these two we wanted to thank you for the great service
