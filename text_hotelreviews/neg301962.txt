the bad news i read the previous reviews and was concerned about the metro noise so asked for a quite room the staff couldn t have been more helpful and polite i thought the room would be perfect back of the hotel away from the main street which is busy upper floor level all good so far am the guests in the adjoining room arrive back at the room and shower turn on the tv to a high audible level and start doing their stuff they might as well have been in my room as there is practically no sound insulation between the rooms i took a sleeping pill it made any rumble for the metro pale into insignificance to the hotel management you need to look at your sound insulation problem or find another architect contractor too many reviews complaining about noise will eventually sink your rating a pity as it ticks all the other boxes
