i requested allergy free room due to down allergy did not have requested connecting rooms as we were traveling as a large family with three rooms did not get they had it but refused to give it to us due to a club change the first night my daughters bed had no bedding and we waited until at night to get anything at all my child is so this is unacceptable she slept with a mattress cover as a blanket they didn t even care they didn t see a problem with it our first night in paris was all about the hotel the staff thought changing one of our three rooms to an executive club room was sufficient for all of this absolutely made a dream trip to paris with my mother and daughter a challenge the first room we had you had to straddle the toilet to open the door we made the best of it but when i think of it i get upset again every time we asked the concierge for a recommendation they knew nothing of what we needed we did need a dr once on our trip and that was quick and very resonable priced
