the receptionist alexander made our staying in this hotel awful he s very rude and has no manners and arrogant and provocative we had and an issue with the extra bed and he literately kicked us out of the hotel and told us that my brother can sleep in the lobby or book another hotel for him he did not let my brother in the room because there is no space for extra bed although i have sent dozens of emails and called them about the extra bed and in booking com room description there was nothing that there is no extra bed can be fitted in the room he did not give us any alternative choices and did not apologies and did not co operate with us and i quote from him you saw a cheap price and booked the room and did not read how do you hire a receptionist who says those kind of things to a customer although we re a member in hilton honors he did not treat us well a big shout out and thanks to the receptionist angelie she was really co operative and understanding and helped us to move into another room that my brother can stay with us at the same hotel and she checked on us and made sure everything is good
