we were originally given a room on the top level so there wasn t a window only a small skylight which made me quite claustrophobic unfortunately it was a couple of days before they had another room available and i was very happy when they did the room given to my adult daughters was huge but with the angle ceiling again in the roofline it meant the window was from the floor up to about a metre
