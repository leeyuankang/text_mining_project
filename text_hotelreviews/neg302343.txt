hot water availability very inconsistent the first day we didn t have any hot water the wifi is very slow and the general room facilities are generally very worn the phone in the room did not function a few lightbulbs blown above the sink in bathroom one next to the bed beds are on wheels so they dislocate from the walls very easily too we were in a generally very green room too which felt very old fashioned
