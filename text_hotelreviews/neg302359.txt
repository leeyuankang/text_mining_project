we were in room in what should have been a double room but surely it is not a double room in fact to fit in a double bed from the window side there were not more than between the side of the bed and the wall moreover even as regards switches and socket outlets it was obvious that this is a single room as with a double bed the switches end up right under the pillow there was even just one pair of complimentary bed slippers for sure it was not what you expect in a star hotel
