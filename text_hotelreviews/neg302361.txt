one of the staff memebers stole money from our room when we went out one evening when we asked reception to look into this they was not helpful and wouldn t even check cctv and she had a smirk on her face the whole time worst service from a hotel ever i would not recommend it and was such a shame as we was celebrating my friends birthday
