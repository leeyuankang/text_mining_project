there was no aircon in the room hence we had to open the window however the location is along the main road possibility that it would be a bit noisy at times also there are times that it is hot or warm in the evening but it is definitely warm at daytime so we requested for a cooler or a fan at least for the room where my nephew is the staff happily provided it
