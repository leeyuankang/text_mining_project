location s entourage isnt the greatest works in progress and does not match the photos closest metro station is san babila so expect some walking to do or ride the bus some of the staff members are not worth being front desk assistants while others exceeded the expectations and provided great level of services its unfortunate for a stars hotel and would impact the journey of customers having a long stay what i hated the most is blocking my credit card with the full amount of money preauthorization though it was booked as prepayment only pay at thr property directly however on last day after checking out the receptionist stated that the amount needs around weeks to be refunded to my credit card this is very unfortunate specially when i paid the full invoice by cash so the blocked amount should have been immediately like other booking com hotel previously did with me or they should have released faster than that blocking such a huge amount on a customer s credit card for weeks isnt very convenient
