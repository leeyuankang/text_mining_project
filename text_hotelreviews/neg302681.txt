way overpriced most expensive yet least enjoyable of all the many hotels on our trip the smallest room too old hotel inconvenient location only tram nearby no metro very far from train stations and airport not a lot to eat nearby that wasn t exorbitantly high or uninteresting splurged to relax but didn t happen here either old and foo foo hotel not even breakfast is included will probably never stay in a relais chateau after this experience
