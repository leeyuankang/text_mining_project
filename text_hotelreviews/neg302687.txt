was just a little underwhelming for a relais chateau location was also just a little bit off centre it was a mins walk to the duomo which is not too bad but i felt i was booking something closer the omelette at breakfast was very oily with sun dried tomatoes than fresh cut ones and closer to a double fried egg than an omlette
