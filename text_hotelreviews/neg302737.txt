stupid flyer for a pancake breakfast absurd in a french relais chateaux in italy made no sense plus the flyer is ugly and not refined the wood stand with restaurant open handwritten at the entrance and the electric sign of the restaurant blinking outside totally ruined the image of a relais chateaux plus it conveys the massage the idea that there is a problem with their restaurant the bar of the hotel is very cold the attendant not attentive and not willing to please
