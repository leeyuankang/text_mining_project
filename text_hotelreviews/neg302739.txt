we asked for twin beds for our older children who were sharing a room when we got there the bed was a double at first they said they couldn t do anything till the next day only when i insisted they said they could give them another room they did give us another room but they said they would make up the beds while we were out for dinner when we got back they hadn t made up the beds to twins so we asked for the bedding and our children made up the beds but in the process they noticed that the mattresses were disgusting we complained to peter on reception who was very apologetic and offered us another room but as they were unpacked we decided to leave it as long as the mattresses were changed after all this hassle the manager knocked half of the price off for the cost for that night i did not like the idea of the bath shower in the main room
