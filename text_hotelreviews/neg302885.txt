the only thing i didn t like was the service at the hotels restaurant on sunday morning at the breakfast we didn t get any attention from staff which is not normal for the hotel of this level when we were leaving we decided to have a drink before going to the airport so we didn t have much time we waited for min and it turned out that they forgot about our order restaurant is the weak point
