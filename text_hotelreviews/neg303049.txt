with all the staff we have met except the one in the breakfast room no one seems to be willing to smile to the guests but i am sure they do know how to smile i was told the chechout time was noon upon my arrival but on the date of my departure the woman behind the desk said their checkout time was with a poker face only because i was back to the hotel at considering it is a star hotel the breakfast should be better i found mosquitos in the room but the guy said they got no way to deal with it it is beyond me how this hotel obtained a star i should have chosen somewhere else
