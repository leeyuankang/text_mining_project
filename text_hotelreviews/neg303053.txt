i sustained a back injury years ago which i did take care of but when i slept in the beds of a this hotel that pain resurfaced i was in pain and actually requested for an early check out which they refused the beds are like its made with woods or something and i had mosquitos some insects bite the next morning the man who checked me in has not hospitality gens in his vain as while i was talking to him he was busy doing other stuff the first rule of any resonable front desk agent is when a guest walks into your lobby you should make eye contact pause and engage the guest he was just rude when i walked in there was no eye contact no saultation just went straight to your passport please i was like maybe i caught him in a bad mood regardless of your mood your guest should not see it however the fellow on night duty was somewhat polite overall sleeping experience was a nightmare those beds should be thrown out the window on a plus note the location of this property is amazing as everywhere is almost a walking distance is you are up for a good walk
