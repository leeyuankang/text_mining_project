this is not a four star hotel it is way overrated from the missing comfort and the miserable breakfast offer let s start with the room its acoustic is terrible you can hear the other people in the next and across the hall rooms the furniture is old and smelly a major upgrade to both the room furniture and breakfast offer would be needed to make this a four star hotel so misleading
