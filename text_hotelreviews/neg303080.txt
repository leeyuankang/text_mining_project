upon arrival the staff member demanded our passports rather than ask for them and when we got to our room it stunk overwhelming like perfume as though a smoker had been in the room and they had tried to cover it up setting off coughing fits in both me and my mother we opened the windows and went out for a few hours and on return it was just as overwhelming we spoke politely to the same rude man who checked us in and send he couldn t do anything except ask the housekeeping staff not to use perfume the following day we requested complimentary water to stop the coughing and we re told it was not possible we could have water with our breakfast the following morning eventually the rude receptionist pointed us in the direction of the nearest supermarket where we stocked up on water and cough drops and returned to the room for a very uncomfortable night sleep breakfast was cold scrambled eggs that were never refreshed with croissants that had been fingered by the ungloved host as he moved them from the bottom shelf to the top overall a very overpriced experience with very poor service location is the only thing going for this property
