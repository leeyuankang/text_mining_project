instead of getting a double bed we got two singles pushed together didn t bother us too much but was still a bit off got weird bites all over our legs after the first night we suspected there was something in the bed sheets but we aren t that sure of this also we could hear a lot of what was going on outside our room which was quite distracting and made it hard to sleep at night some construction works were on right outside our window too
