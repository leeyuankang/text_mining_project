there was a constant siege smell on the corridors the room wasn t clean and it was smelly and the air conditioner had a very loud noise even after them fixing it which kept me awake all night it didn t really cool the air or dehumidifier switching off and opening the window wasn t an option due to the even louder street noise and the heat
