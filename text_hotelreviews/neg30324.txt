we have emailed the hotel and passed feedback on check out we were allocated room and it was extremely noisy due to the elevator position constantly through the night you could hear it being used opposite our room was also a storage cupboard for house keeping so saturday and sunday morning again constantly awoken by housekeeping entering and making noise using this cupboard for the amount we paid i was disappointed as we specifically chose a hotel hoping it was going to luxury i am also disappointed that we have highlighted this to the hotel and they haven t responded i certainly think this room should have been discounted or highlighted as an issue with the closeness of the elevator and the service cupboard
