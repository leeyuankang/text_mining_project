the tram runs opposite the hotel so it was very noisy the rooms were run down without any tea coffee maker no drinking water was provided so we had to buy from outside we had to close the widows to keep the street noises out and the airconditioning in the room was not working when we contacted the front desk we were rudely told that we came from india and we were used to tempretures of degrees so we did not need the air conditioning the staff dont even help take your bags from the car or load them
