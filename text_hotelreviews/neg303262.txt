we book a room with twin bed i travelled with my friend but in fact there was a double bed in the room wich was not such a big problem if they had two blankets on it but they didn t i went downstairs and asked for a blanket but they brought a plaid of some artificial material seriuosely how would we use it instead of a blanket well we had to take the sheet that we removed from the bed to cover the plaid to make it possible to sleep under it at all and slept on the bed without a sheet there was horribly noisy in the room there is a very buisy street outside always full of cars and trams plus the tubes in the hotel made some loud and annoying noise from time to time all night long i think they just put us into the worst room they had because i booked with a big discount if i knew that the discount meant lack of quality i would never save money on the comfort in fact even with the discount the hotel didn t worth the money we spent on it
