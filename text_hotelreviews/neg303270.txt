large patches of mould in the bathroom ceiling ugly shower bathroom suite and room furniture certainly inadequate for a stars hotel in milan and for the price i was charged when i shared my opinion with a member of staff i was told that the patches in some of the rooms mine wasn t the only one in this status were due to spills of water caused by careless tourists enjoying their bath he admitted that the hotel as a whole needs to be refurbished apparently they have already renovated some of the rooms in the last couple of years they will be happy to accommodate a request for an already renovated room next time very unprofessional
