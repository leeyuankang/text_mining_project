the breakfast was a little basic bacon and scrambled eggs juice basic cereals ie all bran cornflakes rice crispies a few cold meats the best bit were the fresh croissants although we went out of season a few mornings people had to wait as there were no free tables left the staff didn t speak english at all so was difficult to communicate they offered cappuccinos etc but not sure if these were charged
