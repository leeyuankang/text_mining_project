the room looked worn there were scratches all along the walls of the room sink and tub the toilet was stained and so was the bathmat on the tub no chair by the desk but there was a plastic chair on the opposite side of the room the clothes hangers were high up and difficult for me to use i am around tall but these are all minor things compared to the shower i had worst shower ever when i first turned the tap on the water came out of the opening of the tub overflow plate which doesn t make sense along with whatever black gunk was in there lucky for me the drain wasn t working all that well so i had to stand in the tub and wait for the dirty water and the floating black bits to go away before i could try again on my next try i flipped the diverter before turning the tap on there was good water pressure from the showerhead but unfortunately the showerhead wouldn t stay up on the rail i thought i d try holding the showerhead but it was incredibly difficult to use the showerhead while avoiding touching the shower curtain especially since they thoughtfully installed the shower fixture in the middle of the tub after a few awkward tries i finally figured out that if i had the water at half pressure the showerhead wouldn t slide down as fast and i would only be standing in half an inch of water instead of an inch or more the rest of the shower was laborious as i had to keep pushing the showerhead back up and repositioning the shower curtain away from me when i finally got out of shower i saw that my fight with the shower had an unintended consequence somehow there was a huge puddle in the hallway outside the bathroom i was almost in tears at this point i had been travelling since the previous day have just had two action packed days and was incredibly exhausted when i checked into hotel romana
