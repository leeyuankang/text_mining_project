they charged the credit card i used for booking days before check in though it was said on the web i was still super surprised that it was not like other hotels that charged you full price on checkin day but no free cancellation allowed before days which was what i understood i did not have a chance to pay with another credit card or cash on site and it brought me a big trouble there was no shower but only tub in the bathroom the furnish of bathroom is a bit old i did not like the smell of towels
