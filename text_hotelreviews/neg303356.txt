we stayed for two nights and the first night the air conditioning did not work so we did not sleep as it was over degrees the second night the ac was a little better after it had been apparently fixed but still really hot when we woke up in the morning the ac had flooded the whole room and the carpet and all of our stuff was soaked we still had to pay full price as well not happy
