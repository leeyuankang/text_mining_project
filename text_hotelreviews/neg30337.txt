our tea in the afternoon was served without sugar during our breakfast we had three times to ask for butter it wasn t on the buffet but normal on every table in the room we had no space to store our personal things beside the clothes to hang on sunday morning at am there was a big noise with glass which was ranged away outside during our last experiences with booking com the rooms were the farthest away very little not as beautiful as described on the website and when we booked directly on the websites of the hotels everything was much better and comfortable
