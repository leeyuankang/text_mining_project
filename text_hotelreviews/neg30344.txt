the room i was given had no wifi signal and they knew as when i rang they immediately offered to move me the room i moved too was not the same quality that i booked and was right under a nightclub and the smoke alarm went off twice in the middle of the night due to the fog machine in the night club the paper i requested was never delivered the phone never got answered and every time i rang for anything i had to hold on and ring at least times
