this is not star hotel but rather stars only one receptionist was friendly others were not approachable and not friendly at all air conditioning did not work so it was very hot in the room and when the window was open the noise from the street was coming and street was quite noisy hotel did not have iron or ironing room if you need to iron something then you should order laundry services for additional fee in addition some bugs bited us during the night much better hotel can be booked for the same price
