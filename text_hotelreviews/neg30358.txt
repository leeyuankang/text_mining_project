i booked two junior suites at the same time one was on the floor and one was on the floor they were within your standards for rooms but not comparable the floor room was elegant with full length windows curtains and a chandalier and the floor room was attic in design with small windows no curtains and the lighting was inadequate really the suites need to be called something else to differentiate them apart
