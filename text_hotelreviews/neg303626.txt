the hotel hasn t been updated in thirty years the airconditioning in my room didn t work it only made noise there are no electrical outlets next to the bed instead there is some sort of control panel that looks like it came out of a s sci fi movie the room has a carpet floor a carpet floor in italy where in summer time it reaches degrees i didn t sleep well and the wifi doesn t work well either this hotel needs some serious love to be able to compete with the other hotels in the city i will not be recommending it
