this is in respect of my stay for january the manager who puts up only one person to work in the restaurant should get a reality check i have been waiting for hour for someone to take room service order from me i am hungry i have to work till late and i need food under my face i have no time for running around getting takeways the restaurant needs at least people to work in the evenings this is not the fault of the staff but the manager who totally messed up the organisation
