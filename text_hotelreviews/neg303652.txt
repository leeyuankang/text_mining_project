despite the many positives of this location and hotel there are a few areas that could be addressed strangely the wifi was only available in the rooms themselves not even in the restaurant or lobby i assume this is to prevent random people from using the hotel s network but is not helpful to guests firstly the hotel interior is visibly out dated and in need of some proper repair work the rooms furniture is old and the fixtures are in need of replacement many parts of the room such as wooden frames had obviously been hastily fixed or not yet repaired the bathroom showed the age of the hotel the most with rusting fixtures and an old hose style hair dryer both my friend and i gave up trying to dry our hair while staying there take your own if this is important to you the room also featured a very old panel of buttons for a radio that didn t work and light room controls there was no clock in the room and i had to search through the tv channels just to find one with the local time one of the windows could be opened but the other was missing it s handle thankfully i could open one window as i could not control the temperature and found the room very hot my friend found the same in her room there is currently building construction happening on one side of the hotel not in the hotel s control obviously and they often started before be sure to ask for a room away from the construction although in a fabulous location with great staff this hotel is not what i would call star simply based on the out dated rooms and need for proper repairs the star system is not regulated around the world but having stayed in many places in a variety of countries i can say that this hotel is probably now a star that once was a star it has great potential to be a star once again
