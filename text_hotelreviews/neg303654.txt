most definitely the bathroom was one of the worst we experienced ever bathrooms are so much better even in a world country star hotel the fixtures were rusty with the chrome wearing off the faucet was difficult to negotiate as the handles were very tough the towels are rough and most certainly unlike any star or for that matter any star hotel we stayed in room and i hope the other bathrooms are not similar the whole bathroom requires complete re modeling cannot understand why a hotel that charged us more than per night has a worn out bathroom on the other hand if the other bathrooms are better then this hotel may have a bigger and a more serious problem it may mean that the staff discriminates when they allocate rooms to the guests based on their ethnicity hotel did not have any business center or any facility that allows a guest to use a computer for emails or get any printing work done the bed was hard but not uncomfortable however there were only two pillows and they were very hard we couldn t sleep well and upon request housekeeping provided extra pillows and guess what they were nice and soft no ironing facility in the hotel first time we experienced that the hotel did not have any ironing board and iron available when asked they said they had a laundry facility that would iron our clothes but at a cost this is a hotel that charged us euros per night
