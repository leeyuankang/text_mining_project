i thought the room was quite small for a couple staying over a week there was only one chair and no armoire i reserved at a point when the canadian dollar was very very low and the full amount was taken from my credit card immediately no refund and no chance to change my mind if i had found a place a bit more affordable in any case we enjoyed our stay but it really was too for us we didn t eat in the hotel restaurants due to the cost for us
