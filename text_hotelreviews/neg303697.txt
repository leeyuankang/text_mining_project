i had to wait for my room even though i gave my time of arrival the reception did not apologies and no hospitality offered because of the in conscience when i eventually went to my room i found the window wide open at first i thought it was a good idea i shut the windows and on my return the smell of cigarette smoke was extremely strong i don t smoke myself and this i found upsetting i called reception and a chamber made arrived with a spray i was told that i could leave the window open in that case i would hear traffic all night or close the window and i hail the fumes not a good experience in this hotel
