from the moment we walked into reception it was as if we d travelled back to the behind the reception desk looked like an old fashioned hotel with lots of files and paperwork the lifts landing restaurant had old carpet and old furniture as for the bedroom on the plus side it was a good size room but it had an old carpet dark green tiles in the bathroom which made it very dark style wooden fitted furniture the sofa bed room had a broken blackout blind so was permanently dark the main bedroom only had thin blinds no curtains so was light all night there was peeling wallpaper if the hotel was decorated and updated throughout it would be a fantastic place to stay fortunately lots to do in milan so it s possible to stay out of the hotel from breakfast till bedtime
