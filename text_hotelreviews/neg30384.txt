the room was too small for a star hotel the basic room is actually very bad with people carrying bags you have no place to put your bags or clothes i asked for a bigger room and they gave me one near the air conditioner machines which make being in the room like being right near a refrigerator in the end i had to pay extra for an upgrade and the room was much better this is the only bad point on this hotel
