when there became a problem with my booking i was told to contact the hotel direct i had to call italy twice and emailed them at least times but could not get confirmation of my booking booking com then told it had been cancelled by the hotel so had to rebook via booking com whilst travelling to italy whilst the hotel was lovely this did mar the stay in milan a bit
