someone charged fresh orange juice to my room number and upon checkout the desk staff made me wait while they phoned the breakfast room to give them a physical description of me to see whether it matched the person who had ordered the orange juice the manager was even there at the checkout desk and saw the whole thing happen but did not say a word conclusion hotel management is very offensive and unprofessional
