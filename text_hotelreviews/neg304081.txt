poor noise control very limited ammenities poor restaurant selection of food and quality of food some staff provided poor service and were rude i tot the high reception desk staff taking down to guests upon checking was a very interesting concept showed how little awareness they have on service and client relationship the only other place they have such concept is probably in a pawn shop in hong kong it s a very poorly maintained boutique hotel that started well but ended up more like an ibis with a posh address housekeeping and bell desk are the most friendly
