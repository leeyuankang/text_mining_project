room luxe really disappointed by quality of services for a spa wasn t available because of work without compensation room wasn t correctly clean we stayed nights and shower never cleaned cup in the room never washed etc traces of rust on washbasin pictures on their website with beautiful view on the dome and when we arrived we had view on building wall and we could not open curtains because of windows in front of parking really expensive for days and you don t have access to your car if you don t make a request before honestly i will never go back to this hotel
