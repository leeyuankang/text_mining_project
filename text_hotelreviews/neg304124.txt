while check in it was taking a long time and gave us a wrong type of room during the time no one ever told us the swimming pool was closed on that day and no one ever apologized for this after checked in no one showed us the property and leaded us to the room the door lock was not sensitive to the key card and some outlets in the room were broken and in the morning the whole room were out of power for few minutes and it was taking minutes until the hot water coming out in the shower while checking out the receiptionest charged wrong money the total for night stay was euro i think the value is not worth if i know i will receive this kind of service and facilities i might just pay euro for an airbnb which might provide better things to me
