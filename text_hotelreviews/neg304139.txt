the quality of the rooms and items in the room were of a cheap standard our shower had mould all around the floor tiles and the water pressure was non existent the bed sheets were like cardboard and pillows were rock hard in order to reach the toilet paper one had to get up off the toilet and reach across the other side of the room as this was its location even the tallest of people would still have to do this the hotel price is very high and the quality is that of a star hotel we were supposed to stay for two nights but left and went to a star hotel close by that was excellent hotel manzoni again the staff were great but unfortunately the quality of the rooms was very disappointing
