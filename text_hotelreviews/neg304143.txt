dust on the chairs dusty courtains bathroom with no privacy dust on the armchair room was close to the elevator and quite noisy insulation against noise was very poor at we have been woken up by the bellboy with room service which we didn t ask for in fact he knocked on the wrong door in the bathroom the toilet paper was fixed on the opposite wall compared to the wc and it was impossible to get without standing up and walking there the mirror in the bathroom had a broken angle inferior left and was dangerous in case you were touching it in general considering the brand and price level i wasn t expecting to find these issues quite disappointing
