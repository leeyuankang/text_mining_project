the breakfast was not nice at all this was the only let down for us bacon and scrabbled egg was cold and the bread was hard and hardly any choice we eneded up eating breakfast out of hotel found a fab little restaurant left and left again out of hotel so if booking this hotel don t bother including breakfast
