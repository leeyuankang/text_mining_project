the location in the city center but no shops around you you have to walk more than min to find supermarket there is no tea and coffee tray in the room when asked they provided a kettle only swimming pool is too much small compared to the huge number of rooms so it is always full i have stayed there two nights and didn t find a time to swim or use the jacuzzi break fast buffet has many thing missing a five stars hotel should have bigger buffet with a multi options they don t have an airport shuttle bus while it is clearly mentioned in booking com site that they have it is mentioned that they have a good terrace on roof unfortunately they have closed it and made it a restaurant so anytime you go there to relax they will keep bothering you by asking you to make an order for food or drinks
