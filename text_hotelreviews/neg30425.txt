my daughter mrs joanne downes made the booking on our behalf but when arriving at the hotel on friday dec the duty manager implied that she had insufficient funds to cover the cost of the room booked despite being shown documentary evidence of the fact that more than enough funds would be available on the day of her departure this caused a great deal of distress to my daughter and granddaughter who was reduced to tears it was agreed that my card would be used as surety on arrival on the sunday although i was happy to do so it showed a distinct lack of trust in the integrity of your customers once the agreement had been made that should have been the end of the matter until my arrival but the same duty manager raised the subject with my daughter on the saturday a totally unnecessary action causing further distress i understand that the duty manager was following hotel procedures on the friday night but would suggest that your duty managers be given greater authority to use discretion in such circumstances there is absolutely no excuse for his behaviour on the saturday and if he wished to pursue the subject further he could at least have found somewhere more private than the hotel lobby where any other guests could have overheard what was being said
