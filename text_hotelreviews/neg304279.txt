the staff very rude and unwelcoming no wifi they just promise things that don t exist and there is no one to talk to we were told that it is our problem they just write everywere around the hotel how important the customers are for them wich is very far from reality never received such a terrible treatment the only good thing was the location but it is definitely not worth it
