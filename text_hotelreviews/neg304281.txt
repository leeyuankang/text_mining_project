the room and room facilities were awful and well below a star standard the room was about metres square with a very small desk no suitcase stand and no space to store suitcases out of the way and a tv bolted to the wall in one corner the single chair in the room was rocky and about to fall apart the lock on the sliding shutters did not work so the shutters could not be held shut the minibar was not restocked daily and there was no customer record sheet to help account for items consumed no tea or coffee making facilities no english language tv for news etc bathroom metres square with a square shower that could only be reached by squeezing past the bidet and was too small to allow a tall slim male to access his feet to wash them properly the basin drain plug was disconnected from its operating linkage and the basin had a cigarette burn on it there were no instructions fro the air conditioning which we could not get to work so the room was unbearably hot unless we kept the window open and lived with the traffic noise and fumes one of the two lifts was out of action and the other lift was very slow and very small barely room for two people with a suitcase because the lift was so slow we used the fire escape stairway on multiple occasions on every occasion there was laundry or maintenance materials partially obstructing the staircase landings the carpet in the public area was dirty and worn through torn on one of the stairs leading to the lift area the only breakfast available was a continental one there was no cooked food sadly the hotel failed to live up to its espoused ethos
