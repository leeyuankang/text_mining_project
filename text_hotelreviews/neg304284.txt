most important the reception cocky unfriendly impolite unwilling to help as we arrived the accommodation does not have any parking facilities and we knew it there is a modern parking house about from the hotel what we did not know was that the price for the guests was reduced at euros per night which was already very expensive and normal price euros as we asked the reception were to park he did not tell us that the hotel offers entrance bons so in the end we had to pay euros more the rooms dont have any sound isolation at all we did not book breakfast there and i think it was a good decision because italians are nit famous for their breakfast there are plenty of caf s right next to the hotel however the rooms have tv but you can see only italian programms there is not even one programm in english or other language internet is so slow like in the stone age alltogether avoid this hotel it will ruin your stay in this beautiful city
