the so called star hotel is shubby very old style and not kept well the reception area is small one staff does everything bar reception the room was small with ugly old furniture with wall paper coming off the walls cracked toilet and noisy old style aircondtion tv which was inch and cannot be seen properly with an old lift which only takes people if they are without luggage and which was last serviced months ago the towels were harsh to touch and the one sofa chair has not been cleaned for ages the worse is that we got very scracy over the night and got red spots on our backs and necks probably of some bed bugs the staff had an arrogant attitude and when asked to speak to the manager he she was not available and never even tried to make contact with us after the hotel blocked twice the payment even though it was booked with free cancellation the hotel is rated as star but should be a star they overcharged our stay and for the service they offer i feel robbed the photos on the net does not reflect the hotel
