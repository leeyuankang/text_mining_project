the room felt dark and glum with windows covered letting in very little daylight decoration looked old and dated the hotel was however situated next to the tramline bed had a very firm mattress which is not my preference breakfast was quite basic options no variety day to day very small shower unit less than hotel required us to leave the room card at reception no validation required to collect it when returning so theoretically it could be possible for others to take your card i found this very insecure wifi codes are given but can only be used for one device other devices require further codes however the first night the connection was very poor and needed to use my phone hotspot overall i was left just a bit underwhelmed and didn t feel i had great value for money
