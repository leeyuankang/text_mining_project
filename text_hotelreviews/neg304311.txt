i came to milan for two nights for business and leisure i stayed for one night at makinba with a colleague the staff werent very pleasant they appeared almost annoyed when i asked questions about tranport or museums they didn t have a international plug as i forgot mine but they didnt even mention where i could get one eventhou i said it was my first time in milan they didnt provide information on wifi when checked in no control for air conditioning in either room when we enquired about the control the staff mentioned that the air conditioning is switch on throughout the building without possibility to control it after asking for directions a map was only provided when we asked if they had one it appears the staff only do what they have to the minimum no initiative is taken to make you feel welcomed i wouldnt recommend the hotel as i prefer to give business to hotels that make an effect to make your stay pleasant
