not a great start to a night away with my mum initially room very small and pokey room smelt of stale cigarette smoke shown other rooms but not much better ended up in family room with disabled facilities so no bath after a long days shopping martin the doorman did manage to sort out a complimentary bottle of champagne which was appreciated dinner was slow due to the supervisor manager being pretty much on his own and was taking orders making cocktails serving food but food was great i am returning in days time and will give them another chance as i have had previous good experiences at the hotel fingers crossed they get it right
