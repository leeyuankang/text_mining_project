i would give some info for the new guests that if you arrive to milano with train bus from the airport how would you easy reach to the hotel if you dont want to take taxi for the daily ticket around the city for any transportation cost only which allowed you to use any of them for hrs after validiation if you arrive to the train central f s you should just jump on the tram no which will take you straight to the hotel nothing else this tram stops very near to the central station if there are a balcony and you have smoker guests should have ashtray to give after request we didnt want to smoke in the room of course thats why we asked for balcony but there were not available any ashtray said by the room maid we used the plastic cup from the minibar as ashtray which were ok for us anyway i understand that the summer is on but to put only one double linen to the bed for persons and the full bed cover which is very heavy is a little silly and above of it the linen were put under the mattrace tightly which we had to strongly torn out from under to use it i would suggest to put blanket or duvet on the bed and if the guest dont like them then change it but to start only with linen is not really enough the mattrace is not really comfy as we felt our waste bad on the next day however the mattrace wasnt hard the pillows very hard and there were no small one to change not every guests likes puffy hard pillows as your neck got pain on the next morning small pillow would help there were a young man at the breakfast with eye glass on whom seemed that he just pretend to do something but the main job been done by the fellow collegues all by ladies they took the empty dishes re filled the stations running checking around for the empty plates glasses to clear the tables off etc
