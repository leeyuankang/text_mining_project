some of the stuff were unfriendly not all of them were speaking enlish we were charged for a parking space but we didn t get our own and had to share one with another car the second night there was no parking space at all and we had to park infront of the garage the breakfast consisted of very poor choice of meals and some of the food was not fresh most of the windows in the room were permanently locked only one really small window could be opened infront of which we found cigarete butts i don t recommend this hotel
