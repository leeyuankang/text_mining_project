our room was at the front of the property which overlooked a busy road the street noise from cars trams was unbearable all evening going on until around and starting again around we struggled to sleep which really affected our trip the bathroom was very worn and in need of updated so it didnt feel very clean the bed was very uncomfortable and general bedroom area was also very worn i would not say that this hotel is it is in desperate need of updating there are a couple of restaurants in the area but i wouldn t recommend the location to travellers i raised this with the hotel on our return home who offered us a free night not very useful for us as we won t be returning to milan having visited already
