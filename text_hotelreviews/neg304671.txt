the room was very small the furniture was old and not at all like the stylish hotel lobby inside the room there were stairs from the door the the bed area which made the already small room a bit more uncomfortable the window was small and very high up which made the room seem like it was under ground the spa access was included in our room rate but we had to ask twice until we got information on how to use it overall the hotel staff seemed a bit arrogant spa area was beautiful but small
