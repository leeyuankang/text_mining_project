on arrival receptionist promised that restaurant will be open every evening so we can have dinner near the fireplace actually in one evening restaurant was closed for special event and all the guests were served in the bar that is far less nice less spacious and and less comfortable they knew it in advance but did not tell us no wine or whiskey in the minibar only beverages and some beer no additional services are offered like ordering flowers but there was a flower shop m from the hotel lobby bar is pricey you are not allowed to bring a bottle of wine and glasses from he bar to the room yourself instead you should request this from a room service and they will charge you eur per each request
