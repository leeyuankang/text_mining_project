the hotel location is just far from almost everything i regret booking it as a tourist visiting the city and being far from everything the nearest attraction is the san siro stadium which is min walking further the hotel staff are not friendly and not welcoming specially those working in the front desk when i was trying to check in the guy there asked me in a very rode way to park my car in the hotel garage before checking in even though my car was in a proper parking further as a four star hotel they didn t send me anyone to help with my bags i had to ask for it and never receiving it also when i asked them about the late check out option that was one of they main reasons in booking the hotel where that was provided to me through booking they refused then they gave me hrs only in a way where they said it is a favor they are giving to me
