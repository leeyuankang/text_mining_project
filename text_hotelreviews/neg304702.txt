i spend the day at micam came to hotel to have diner restaurent was quite empty chose a table have been told it is reserved rudely nobody offered another table nearby or explained despite there was no sign on the table table was after one hour still not occupied investigation after with the waiter he claimed table is always reserved for a specific guest whether he shows or not maybe you should invest in a reserved sign and friendly staff breakfast team however treats guests as guests warm welcome nice smile
