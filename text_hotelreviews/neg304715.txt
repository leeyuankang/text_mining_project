location is ok but you will need to pay for taxi if returning from a late night out and this is about euros depending on where you are also the air conditioning in our room was not working but when i rang the reception they sent within minutes a technician and when it was confirmed that works needed to be done we were offered the option to change to another room and in fact they said that they would the move for us we were happy with the room temperature but what a nice customer care
