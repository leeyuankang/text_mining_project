throwing a party that lasts until am is ridiculous to say the least my room was right above the party and even the floor was shaking absolutely impossible to sleep at reception been told that party wld finish at pm at pm ask again and told wld finish at at that just few more minutes and music stopped at am truly was credited that night which was a proper financial compensation but sleeping that was my goal proven to be impossible one thing more the hotel has two spaces for a bar on the night of the party closed one of the bars leaving open only the party bar if you re plan is to find an hotel where you can also work think twice before booking enterprise hotel or ask prior if there will be a party
