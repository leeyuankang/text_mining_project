the breakfast was a bit disappointing for us as we eat healthily and the breakfast for clearly for people who do not loads of bad calories bacon sausages eggs and many many biscuits cakes etc there was fresh fruit which was excellent but no greens e g cucumbers peppers lettuce etc just tomatoes which we liked we were however very happy about the soya milk serves hot too for breakfast with coffee thank you generally so not bad at all
