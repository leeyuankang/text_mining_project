reception was illogical our situation we got held up in the british air fiasco at heathrow airport in london we had to stay a couple extra nights in london until we were able to get a flight out we had made a non refundable non cancellable reservation at the hotel and called from london to inform the hotel that we were held up in london because of the british air fiasco but that we were still coming and to hold our rooms the response was ok when we arrived the reception at the hotel stated they had cancelled our room but acknowledged our phone call they stated that even though our room was paid in full was non refundable and that we even called in advance to hold the rooms since we are still coming they stated that they still can and did cancel our rooms because we did not show up on the first date of the reservation after some arguing they agreed to honour our agreement but we had to pay extra for another room
