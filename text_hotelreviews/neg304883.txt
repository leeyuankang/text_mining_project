we booked a week stay and on our first night they put us in the premium room since the regular ones were overbooked so we had to move the next day directions we received from reception to get to the hotel by public transport from the airport were not very accurate and it took us forever to get to the hotel on the way back we opted for a taxi instead some of the staff s english communication skills were not so good so we had hard time to get what we needed through sometimes
