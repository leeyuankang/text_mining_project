the location of the hotel is an absolut disaster it s about to the nearest subway and the area around the hotel is really dreadful a woman in the hotel even got robbed by a man who entered the hotel just to steal her bag he then ran off and jumped into a car that was already waiting for him not a good first day to witness something like that the food at the pool bar is absolutely disgusting everything you order there is frozen and is defrosted by some sort of toaster i ordered a hamburger there and i managed to eat only a few bites and had a stomach ache the rest of the day the mojitos are made with the cheapest ingredients not even real sugar is used i would have expected much more from a star hotel we needed a taxi twice and each time we had to wait for over min even though the second time a told them in advance when the taxi should be here we almost missed our flight because of this and for the size of the hotel there are only about pool chairs outside a lot of people had to lie on the floor
