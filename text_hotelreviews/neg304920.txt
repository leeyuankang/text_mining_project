the location is not fantastic a bit in the middle of nowhere but then the price and the hotel quality makes up for it so i would stay again at the right price most days it was not a big problem there was a taxi outside which costs around euros to get to the centre but on saturday night there was not one in the vicinity apparently there are less taxis working on weekends ended up walking to the tube which took about through dark and slightly shabby roads taxi took around mins depending on traffic the bar closes early at pm and there is nowhere else nearby
