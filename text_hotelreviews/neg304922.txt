it was not her fault but it took ages to order at the pool bar because the girl behind the bar had to go everywhere to get one order ready and was busy with just one order for over minutes a coffee and two burgers by then there where more people waiting so it might be handy to have someone on staff that can help when needed from somewhere else in the hotel the pool was very cold almost freezing the tv channels where all disturbed making it impossible to watch tv don t eat the scrambled eggs they are the powered kind
