they didn t mention anything that the parking is not included in the price and when we left they told us about that the girl at the reception realized it was not ok to ask money for that since there was no mentioning about it so they covered for it also we paid the breakfast the day we checked in and every morning we had to wait at the restaurant because they didnt see our reservation
