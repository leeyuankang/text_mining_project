not much to say here but the blow dryer was very heavy made of steel and hard to use and there wasn t a shelf to put your stuff on in the shower first world problems we also weren t told about the back entrance that leads directly to the shopping center we walked around the entire building every day to get there only to see that entrance by fluke when we were at that end of the shopping center but truly nothing really to complain about this hotel is fantastic the staff make it top notch
