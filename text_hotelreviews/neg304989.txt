bed is too hard for me and it gave me a neck and back ache this is unfortunately why i wouldn t go back that s a personal preference i think though the spa is small and the people rude if you don t have it included in the hotel stay they charge i think whatever they want to be honest i read here that some people paid some euro they wanted me to pay euro for an hour we will give you slippers and a hair net there s only a little sauna and little pool jacuzzi it was raining while i was there so i didn t get to try the pool unfortunately
