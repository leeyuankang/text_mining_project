though i liked the hotel very much and would most probably come back soon there are still a few things that could be improved for example the wifi is for free but the network quality in the room was very very poor and as the air conditioning is switched off during the cold season but it has been a sunny day the room was extremely hot and the only way to cool it down was to open the window with all the consequences what this means incl noise etc
