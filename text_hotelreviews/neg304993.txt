took them five days to fix my aircon technician came on day two and partially fixed it but every time i tried to adjust it aircon just stopped free wifi and business wifi was terrible and again they didn t ever really try to fix it told me one day that there is a problem on level and they ve called someone to fix it but it remained inconsistent at best they never rang me and asked if the wifi had been fixed despite the fact that i called them on three separate occasions days to report the issue woken up at twice by noise outside on the street suggest requesting a room on the other side of the hotel no ironing boards in room and they bring you those crappy mobile ironing boards instead replaced my laundry bags twice without the form to fill in my details meaning i had to call them to bring a form to my room on their own each of these issues are minor apart from the wifi which is very annoying whilst you are on a business trip but when you combine them it made for a frustrating stay
