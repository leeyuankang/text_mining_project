the location is pretty bad it s really far from the centre and you have to walk min to get to the closest metro station a taxi ride to the centre is euro per ride which is expensive for barcelona the neighboorhood is very very quiet with not much to do in the area the check in was a very bad experience we waited min before someone at the reception took care of us they first gave us a room with twin beds despite we had asked for a double bed when we made the booking we had to negotiate really hard to get a double bed it appears they automatically give twin beds to people who use booking com be careful the room s decoration is pretty cold and does not have much personality we did not take the breakfast as we preferred to have it in the city centre
