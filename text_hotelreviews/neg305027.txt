requested a double bed but was told on arrival that there were none left which was disappointing also amenities such as pool breakfast etc were not included in price of booking which was not stated when making our reservation and were very expensive pool pp to use and breakfast pp per day i understand paying extra for breakfast but pool i think should be included also i feel the staff could have been a bit more informative about our surroundings e g tram stops local places to eat shopping centres etc
