we booked three rooms of the same type for same dates and on same date separately for each person but during checkout it turned out that mine is far more expensive the reception staff couldn t explain why also it turned out that breakfast if added during checkin was cheaper than purchased via booking com which doesn t make sense at all there were no slippers in the room the staff at the reception said that they are only for premium rooms c mon guys this is a star hotel nowadays even star hotels have throw away slippers instead nh constanza put individual coffee machines in each room what a waste of money the staff at the reception doesn t speak english fluently therefore checkin process takes too long
