only thing that i didnt like was the check in and out times check in was which meant we had to wait as our flight was early and check out was and our flight was late we were aware of this beforehand however and were prepared to deal with this the hotel also stored our cases before check in and after check out so we didnt have to walk around with our case which was very helpful amazing hotel would recommend to everyone
