the check in process was rushed and felt more like a motel check in rather than in a stars hotel receptionist acted in a routine way and the welcome was practically not existing further more questions were answered even before i could finish completing the sentence upon reminding receptionist that we had chosen a bed type the only answer was we are fully booked we are fully booked we are fully booked i walked away while he was still bubbling something to us as he must have realised of the un proper response had given the receptionist told us that the double room of my sisters had been upgraded to a better one something that was not correct as we walked into the superior room it was exactly as on the pictures on booking com this did not apply to our second room while we booked and pre paid for a superior room of sqm we were assigned a much smaller room and received no apologies nor an offer for compensation if not only after we had checked out unfortunately our experience at this stars hotel was mediocre mostly for the way things have been handled and the very slow responsiveness and will not come back a note of thank you goes to the front office manager mr kiers that days later picked up my email messages and offered assistance
