got a moment first of all i made a booking with credit card guarantee in the end they cancelled it because i was too late while i ve send a message through booking com to them letting them know this result i had to book at the literally last second another hotel l europe and krasnapolsky for sure had sold my early booked room for an extra high price after that i booked days for around night the hotel has no swimming pool and no gym they claim to have one but the gym is located at nh barbizon hotel this hotel is minutes walking or minutes if you don t want to walk through the red light district for a star hotel i think a swimming pool and a gym are required at the reception always queues and always quite some waiting time house keeping didn t refill all products at the room room is very basic and simple some things were simply not working like the coffee machine unacceptabel for a star hotels hotelbar closed at or sometimes even earlier i won t come back here anymore next time i will consider other hotels like amstel hotel
