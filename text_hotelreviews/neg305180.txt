we booked the hotel for the picture of the bath tub and requested it also in website we were told that they didn t have a room with a tub but to ask again tomorrow since we were staying until monday called the next day to request if they had a room with a tub on saturday and the man on the phone was very rude on the call and basically said they have done everything they could for me and if i didn t like it i could just check out so we checked out on saturday and moved to a better hotel with a friendlier staff
