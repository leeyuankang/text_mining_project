besides the foyer and restaurant areas the balance of this hotel looks like a construction site it was cheaply renovated in the area that i stayed with incredibly dark hallways giving one the impression that it wasn t clean the stairs are a nightmare as i got lost in them a rabbit warren and lifts quite slow the rooms were fine but the air conditioning system is noisy and there is no way of turning it off or adjusting it i switched rooms because my bar fridge wasn t working
