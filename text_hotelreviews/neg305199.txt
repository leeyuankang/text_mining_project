the air conditioning was not working in the room from the moment we checked in i immediately notified the reception staff and after countless phone calls back to reception a maintenance man arrived to confirm that the air con system was in fact not working well no surprise there we were on a long weekend break with other couples who were in adjacent apartments so when offered another room which was in a different building my wife and i declined as we all wanted to be close to each other having booked our rooms together we were not offered a discount or any other form of compensation for the lack of air conditioning bearing in mind that there was a weekend heatwave with temperatures over degrees c we were disappointed with the lack of true customer care
