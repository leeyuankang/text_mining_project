staff was rude and facilities are definitely not star checked in at pm and room was still not ready and wouldn t be ready for another hour or more that s ridiculous for a star hotel also daily cleaning also extends past as we came back before dinner and room was still a mess also showers would turn hot and cold without us even flushing our own toilets seems other rooms usage affected our water temperatures definitely not a five star hotel and definitely not worth the money at all staff is also not friendly the key cards didn t work and i went to the front desk for a new one and have the receptionist blame me for demagnetized the card no other hotel i have been to is rude they just gladly give a new card but not here she made it seems so inconvenient that i would even ask for a card to get into my room terrible experience overall
