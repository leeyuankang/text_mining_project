we were taken to a separate building the agent said it was an upgrade led us through a long hall in the main hotel out the locked door through an alley with people loitering into the annex up the elevator and into a room on the first floor that overlooked a noisy smelly street looking out the window from the room onto this street you were welcomed with an awning covered in bird doo and fast food restaurants lining the street not acceptable this should be the last room provided and only when explained to the buyer i went to the front desk asked for a room in the main hotel and was quickly re accommodated to the floor lovely quiet room they were very quick to help and friendly in the change very satisfactory the floors in the final room weren t as clean as they should have been with lots of sandy type dirt caught on our shoes the rest of the room was fine
