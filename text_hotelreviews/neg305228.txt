this hotel was massively overpriced this last year i ve stayed in several star hotels and paid around per night the last was very opulent with a free mini bar several snacks etc the nh hotel cost per night not including taxes the room was very basic and had a view of the roof when i complained i was moved to one of their more expensive rooms free of charge which was still considerably basic by comparison the first room was similar in style and quality to one of those ibis hotels with a shower booth the second was slightly nicer than a premier inn room for the cost i was expecting grandeur the cost in itself is not a concern for me but value for money is i will not use again
