i didn t like the glass doors in the bathroom you cannot see through them but you don t really get much privacy otherwise if you know what i mean and for whatever reason the restroom didn t smell that clean when i arrived i think the price is mostly due to location so keep that in mind it s a great hotel but not a good choice if you aren t trying to splurge
