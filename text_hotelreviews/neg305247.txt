we booked a premium room however the room we got did not match with the room description no french connection for example although the room was spacious it had a bit an outdated look because of a conference the expensive breakfast was not in the usual room which is really nice and relaxed to sit but in a much darker and smaller room also the bar was sometimes very loud because of a reception of the conference
