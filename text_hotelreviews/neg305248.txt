the only thing that discouraged me is that by check out i was charged of person for the buffet breakfast we didn t consumed we went out of the hotel early the day before for a whole day combu tour and had no time to take breakfast at the hotel but since at check in i said that we ll take breakfast on this date at the hotel they charged me even though we didn t consume it we were not informed that i should cancel it if we can t anyway it was charged to me by check out i have checked in to star hotels like this before but it never happened that we were charged a breakfast we didn t consume just because we said by check in that we will take breakfast at the hotel i might choose another hotel the next time i visit amsterdam
