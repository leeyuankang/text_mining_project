too expensive for nothing i have been to star hotels and its way better than this first night i got bitten by a weird bug in my bed and my foot still swollen and itchy they do not clean the rooms no vacume no antiseptic product use none of it i realized that they do not change your mugs they wash it quick in the sink too over priced and not justified kinda waste of money breakfast is around euros per person and its below average location is perfect since its in dam sqaure but thats it never again in that hotel
