the room is too dull empty of anything that could give it life very boring design or even stuff you fill the room with it looked too empty kinda unfinished the breakfast buffet was the worst i have had in years all you can get is omlete cold scarmbeled eggs and limited choices they also shifted us to the small resturant for days where we couldnt even toast bread because they didnt have a toaster there
