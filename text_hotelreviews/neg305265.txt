hallway lighting was a little dark in the section where we were staying and there needs to be a small light always on in the room entry or at least pointing at the key slot on the light switch inside the room it was too dark to find the light switch key slot since the lights don t work without the key card inserted so you are left scrambling in the dark to get the key card in the slot so you can finally turn the lights on the desk clerk said we could leave the key in at all times but the maid kept removing it and would take it whenever we d leave it in so maybe fix that situation
