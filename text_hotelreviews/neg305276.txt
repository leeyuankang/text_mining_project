the hotel used to be a beautiful old hotel with large spacious rooms which over the last yrs i used to stay every time i went to amsterdam i didn t realise since my last visit a few years ago it had been renovated i have no issues with modernization or updating a hotel but who ever did the work was only thinking about one thing squeezing the most amount of box size rooms into the new space as possible the layout is awful it has no character anymore it is essentially a warehouse full of hundreds of tiny rooms my room was a double room and there was barely any room to swing a cat in there i was supposed to share this room with a friend of mine who was not able to make it at short notice thankful so it turned out the twin room would have been far too small for two men sharing i will not be returning again unless it is free i will stay at the raddisson next time as the prices were about the same alex russell
