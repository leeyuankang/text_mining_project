one of my party was attacked and robbed in the foyer of the hotel on the red carpet no security staff were available no member of staff called the police we were half way through a new years eve meal in their restaurant when this happened whilst the member of my party was returning to the table after having a look out of the front of the hotel such a shock for our whole party we had to leave the remaining courses of our meal which was horrible anyway so no great problem there i felt that them charging me the full price of over euros for people was unfair in the extreme our room was not in the hotel we were told on arrival we had to walk across a public alleyway which had gangs trying to force their way in behind you again no security very frightening stay
