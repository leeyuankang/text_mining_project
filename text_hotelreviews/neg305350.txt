the facilities dont match the price except for the very very expensive bedrooms to go to your bedroom you have eitheir to go to a different building or to walk a long walk to get there some corridors make you feel that you made a wrong turn somewhere for almost euros per night i got a room with a view to some roof and air con tubes and a room that you can find on any airport hotel had to pay for an upgrade so at this point per night and was sent to a different building with just minor better look could not believe it was worth euros per night at the end gave up the view to get a room closer to the breakfast and reception location is good but you dont get what you expect you might think i am picky but it was the first time i felt the need to ask for anther room regret booking it
