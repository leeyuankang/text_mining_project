one of the lady bar staff was quite rude and not at all helpful in fact we was told on new year s eve that when we ordered a drink it would take ages and if we would like to go elsewhere feel free which is quite amusing considering there was about people that night in dam square and you could not even get out of the hotel let alone get into a bar also the safe in the room did not work despite telling staff about this apart from the above overall a nice time was had
