very informal new decoration and poor quality standing of the reception desk people we booked rooms one for us and one for our daugthers and they tried to put us in one room incredible for such hotel and not nice at all when you need to negotiate before stepping into your rooms this was our second stay in this hotel the first one was before all the decoration changes and it is very clear to us that this hotel is not as magical as before it losted its genuine spirit and nice atmosphere apart the great location it is now one hotel among many others it s a pity
