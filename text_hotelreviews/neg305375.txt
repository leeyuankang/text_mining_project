the amsterdam wing of the hotel doesn t feel like it s part of the main hotel horrible side entrance accessed through a public alleyway with garbage and takeaway boxes scattered everywhere doesn t make it feel like a star hotel rooms in the amsterdam wing face a busy and dirty side street i m sure i could hear rats scuttering around somewhere at they weren t in the room but must have been close by since that side street is full of takeaways the quality of room service food needs improving horrible club sandwich and breakfast omelette but the smoked salmon was excellent
