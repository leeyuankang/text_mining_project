the building design means that there are several clusters of rooms accessible by dedicated small lifts elevators and that can mean a long wait at busy times not sure if this can be changed though based on the furniture provided in the room it the room could do with being about longer hard to get into and out of the chairs at the work desk i didn t take breakfast as this was too expensive plenty of places nearby offering excellent value breakfast
