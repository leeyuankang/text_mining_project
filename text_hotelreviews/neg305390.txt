for a five star hotel and the amount i paid i was disappointed for the following reasons the toilet was dirty when i arrived it smelt of urine as if it hadn t been cleaned with detergents for days i called room service and waited minutes for an answer when i did finally get through the lady who took my order was abrasive then when i asked her to confirm my order she got aggressive using vulgar language and one of her colleagues took over her colleague then tells me she is busy and is stressed as if that is a reason to ever justify being rude to a guest
