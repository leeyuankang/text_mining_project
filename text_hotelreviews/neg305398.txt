breakfast is very expensive and actually could be a lot better especially given the cost and i am thinking here more of the cooked buffet as the quality and selection of the cooked food is at best average and actually given the price it should really be classed as poor all the rest of the breakfast buffet is good the next time we stay here on pleasure we will skip the hotel breakfast and find somewhere local to eat better cooked food at less than half the price
