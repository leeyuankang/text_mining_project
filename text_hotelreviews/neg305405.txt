we were upgraded to a superior room however although recently refurbished the room poorly equipped beds with nightstands one desk and one armchair were the only furniture in the room and the only element of decoration was the tv the room was right above the hotel patio and was therefore very noisy poor soundproofing between rooms overall the minimum was there but hardly anything more overall the hotel is more worthy of stars or stars than
