i am most upset about my room location with it being next to the cleaning cupboard i was disturbed by the cleaner every morning this is not the fault of the cleaner but due to the lack of soundproofing of the wall also in room there is a door adjoining another room feeling poorly i had to return to the hotel during the day i was woken that afternoon by someone rapidly trying the door handle this was very unsettling to say the least after that the people in whatever room that is that joins were then conversing which was clearly audible to me and disturbing i was unable to rest the hotel is lovely but my room was not worth my that much of my hard earned money unfortunately
