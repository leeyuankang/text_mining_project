there was a little hiccup with our check in and after making sure i did all i could by contacting the hotel directly before leaving the u k and having emails after emails there was still problems with check in i will say this was sorted in the end but it was just a little embarrassing and time consuming especially when i had sorted it all before leaving the uk
