the staff were horrendous there s a little blondie called nadia she was by far the rudest person i ve met the breakfast was a out of the door keys broke times in days that s out of order in my opinion when you spend thousands on a hotel i requested early check in because my flight was early but i still couldn t check in until pm that s also out of order when you spend a decent amount of money on a hotel and once you arrive at the hotel the staff try to par you off to their apartments it s more like a hovel a hostel not a luxury hotel so please don t be fooled by their upgrade
