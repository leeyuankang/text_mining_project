extremely poor customer service everything began when i called the hotel to make sure we would have had an earlier check in at the arrival the lady at the phone mentioned that they did not have any reservation under my name and when we arrived we did not have any earlier check in when we finally got the key and went to the room we opened the door with the wifi key two people were already in the bedroom when we were assigned to another room i tried to have a shower and when opened the bath towels i found fake eyelashes the clean towels were delivered after more that minutes definitely it was not worth what we paied
