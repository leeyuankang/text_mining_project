the offer to upgrade our booking a superior double room to an appartment was shambolic we were led to a narrow dark flat completely off site previous staff accommodation which we thought would not have been worth more than of the fee we paid for our superior double room needless to say we refused to take up this offer and insisted on our original booking to date it still puzzles me what made the receptionist think that we would be delighted with such an upgrade which really would have been a massive downgrade therefore beware
