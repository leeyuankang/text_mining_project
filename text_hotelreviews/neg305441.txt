when we arrived the recepcionist suzan tried to host us in an upgrade room it was an old apartment outside and far from the main building on the third floor reached by narrow stairs and without lift impossible to carry the luggage as i said i would never stay there the staff finally found a modern room in the main building alert to everyone when reservating mention that you want to stay in a room inside the main building
