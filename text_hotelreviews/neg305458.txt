the first days the cleaning was disappointing with a weird smell like the water hadn t been changed and the bedding top wasn t changed even though we called and asked because it had a stain we found the cup of the complimentary water of the previous people that stayed there behind our towels in the bathroom and when i showed it to the receptionist she said she would talk to maid service about it and that she didn t know what to do
