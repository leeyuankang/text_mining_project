rooms have been upgraded in hotel which has left them cold and dark we asked for a room upgrade from a superior room to a premier room and even then the room disappointed us the heating wouldn t work in room either and in late september it got pretty cold we complained they gave us a extra blanket and a small heater overall i feel ripped off and won t be staying there again
