very disappointed booked this for family members and it was booked at the pay now price could have chosen the pay on arrival at hotel at cheaper price but wanted it paid for couple arriving ended up they did not take the credit card payment as requested and charged the couple when they arrived they were very distressed by this as they had thought it was paid for in advance it just so happened they had a card with them that they were able to pay otherwise it would have used up a huge chunk of their spending money why ask for prepayment when you are not going to take it all in all they enjoyed the stay and the room was lovely but this upset the start of their trip
