our room was separated from the building of the hotel it was noisy in the room because of the busy road outside view was awful the ac was restricted by the hotel and the room temperature was very high we couldn t sleep there were no someone to greet us when we arrived and no one took our bags everything was self service which is disappointing for a star hotel
