the place is simply too central its right on the dam square the center of the old city down on the road one fast food restaurant next to the other one therefore it was so stinky and smelly like hamburger and old oil for chips that we couldn t even open the window in the middle of the night the hotel is huge and kind of like a labyrinth what is not so convenient also no back yard no balconies no place to relax a bit from this crazy overcrowded and noisy city
