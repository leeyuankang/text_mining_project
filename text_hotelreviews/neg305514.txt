we dropped our bags at the hotel after about an hour long argument with staff who were very happy to argue back and add more fuel to the fire and talk to us like we should have been grateful to be there we left and went a walk around amsterdam for a while when we returned they had no record of our payment that we had made only hours before i will never be returning again and will make sure everyone knows about our experience as a hotel our problems should have dealt with immediately and professionally and wasn t at one stage we just had to let it go as we got the feeling they didn t want us in the hotel most uncomfortable stay of my life i stayed in not far from the krasnapolsky in january and the service we received in there deserves the hotel director of the krasnapolsky should really have a good look at his staff while they are working as attitudes are appalling
