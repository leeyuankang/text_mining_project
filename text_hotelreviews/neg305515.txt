worst customer service i have ever experienced in my life member of staff emailed me twice to say the price of the room and when we got there they said it was a mistake and we had to pay over dearer no apology for mistake but made to pay even though there was proof of original price not the service i expect from a hotel the staff have let this hotel down and as someone who works in the frontline of customer service myself it appalled me the attitudes that we got from the staff disgusting way for a guest to be treated
