service a bit slow in the coffee shop we were there for nights on our first night there was a problem in our room when a revolting smell all night we complained and we were informed that the room adjacent had also complained and that it seemed that there was a problem with the drains and we were given the option of changing room we were given a choice of only one room available we obviously took it but the bath room was half the size of the previous one on check out we figured that we were due some compensation and we indicated that we expected the extras on our bill to be waived these amounted to about for the ruined night and the inconvenience of having to change rooms but the duty manager had no authority for this i therefore emailed the general manager upon my return home and was informed that on my next visit i would be given vip treatment i thanked him very much for his offer and told him that since i had no plans to return to amsterdam furthermore i expected that every guest at the hotel was always treated as a vip and not only when they complained no offer of any compensation was made we were therefore very disappointed with the level of customer care and customer expectation that we expected from a star hotel
