our main disappointment was with the reception staff we felt that they were trying to be so professional that they actually forgot to engage with us as people we had to wait minutes to check out on sunday july and there was no apology for the wait and once we had checked out we were told to wait in yet another queue to enable us to leave our bags at the hotel until our departure thankfully one gentleman had the good sense to realise that people were starting to become unhappy and asked if anyone in the queue just wanted to leave bags to be honest this is not something you would expect at a star hotel
