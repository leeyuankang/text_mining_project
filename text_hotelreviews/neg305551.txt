when we arrived we were told the hotel was full we had requested inter connecting rooms via booking com as we have a disabled daughter but we ve didn t get them the hotel manager said we shouldn t assume that our request would be fulfilled and because of the time we arrived they couldn t accommodate our request after much discussion they gave us two adjoining rooms on the front of dam square down the street facing the delivery depot for the big department store de bijenkorf very noisy all day and most of the night as there was extensive work ongoing in the department store the noise was unbearable with skips being delivered and filled constantly from to after midnight there were also store deliveries on numerous occasions the street was blocked with so many lorries that the police had to get involved our air conditioning didn t work and we couldn t open our windows due to the noise and dust we reported it to reception but nothing was done the managers and staff were very unhelpful and unreasonable the hotel was so busy they did not have enough staff to cope the rooms were adequate nothing more to say it ruined our city break is an understatement i would not recommend this hotel
