check in was very slow and even though i asked a staff member for directions to the elevator no it s a huge hotel nobody asked to bring the luggage to our room my husband was not there so i carried three bags and handled two kids when we finally got to our room the keys did not work i had to go to the reception and the person there did not even apologize for the inconvenience the view from the room was directly to the alley and two buildings where the construction workers started each morning early the hotel is being renovated and it would have been great knowing this beforehand breakfast was nice but noisy and crowded the orange juice did not seem freshly squeezed which i usually expect from star hotels
