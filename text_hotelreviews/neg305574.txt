its not the fault of the hotel but there was too much noise at night time but as we were tired we slept through like a baby maybe its very normal in that part of amsterdam drunk english lads causing too much unrest but amsterdam is very safe and welcoming city the hotel is just a few meter walk to the famous red light district china town and number of monuments coffee shops centraal station etc etc
