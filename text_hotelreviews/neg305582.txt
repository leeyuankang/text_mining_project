the main historical hotel building is only one of many internal buildings of the hotel our superior rooms were in one of the internal buildings elevator and were very very small even for amsterdam standards e g compared to swissotel across dam square they might be ok for a single person but way too cramped for a couple bathroom is actually a glass stall inside the room it is absolutely impossible for one person to use the toilet or the bathroom without totally waking up the other as there s a single light switch for both and the glass walls do not block any light or noise the tiny closet has space for about hangers because of a weird huge clothes pressing contraption that takes most of the space btw the closed is so cramped that some of the little things usually found inside e g cups are store on shelves near or at the floor the minimalist shower stall has absolutely no place to hold anything you d need to shower soap shampoo everything must go in the floor no place to hang towels except for a single hook away from the shower stall we ve also experienced some water temperature variations sudden cold then super hot shots during every shower an unpleasant surprise for a supposedly upper scale and recently renovated property unfortunately we ended up with the feeling of overpaying for a less than stellar comfort level at the krasnapolsky even compared to other and simpler nh collection places we ve stayed earlier during the same trip in italy would hardly consider coming back to it at the current price level probably choosing the swissotel despite its less charming outside appearance
