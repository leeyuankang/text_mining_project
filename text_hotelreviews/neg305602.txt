breakfast was very poor for the price the food was cold and fried eggs dried up coffee from a machine in the restaurant was terrible there were of us at nearly each i would expect to be served the tea and coffee staff on reception didn t seem to know what they were doing they tried to charge again when i had prepaid the rooms and they didn t seem to be able to find anyone s bookings had to ask for the room to be cleaned this is the time i have stayed here and feel that it didn t live up to the previous times
