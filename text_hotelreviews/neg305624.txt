check in took about twenty five minutes with staff trying to locate a twin room which i had booked and already paid for was then sent to lift which was tucked away next to an entrance to a kitchen or service area located a long way from reception and the room only to find a lift doors from our room their version of a twin room is two single beds pushed up against each other placement of fixed bedside tables means this is the only way it can be done the floors felt sticky room only had one set of toiletries and one bathrobe and one pair of slippers flaking paint in shower shower made deafening noise which we only realised late just before going to bed all in all it felt like a poor budget hotel other than for communal areas room was located at side of hotel heading towards red light district and noisey at night shame really as there is so much potential
