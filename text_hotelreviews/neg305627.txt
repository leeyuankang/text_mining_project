the lift to our floor was at the back of the building next to the car park fire door exit felt very uneasy waiting for the lift hotel took a exceptionaly high security deposit upon arrival which they failed to unhold with my bank upon departure so now i am out of pocket for working days which equates to weeks until the funds will be released into my account
