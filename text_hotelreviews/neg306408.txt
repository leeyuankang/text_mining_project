there are two parts in the hotel one has older and very traditional decorated rooms which actually are less clean and one has the newer and modern rooms which are actually quite nice as a result of the ongoing building activities in the hotel there are some minor annoyances to be expected i e signage towards the new rooms the door from the breakfast room being open and flies coming in to enjoy the buffet before i could wasn t a good thing
