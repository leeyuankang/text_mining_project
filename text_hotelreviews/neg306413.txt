the hotel is undergoing refurbishment and even though it is not really felt there is a long and arduous walk from the reception to the room involving two lifts and long corridors i am sure this will be sorted out soon the hotel is in a very central location and so there is some noise from the street at night in the rooms facing the street breakfast could have been included for the price we paid which was not cheap but in line with prices for quality accommodation in amsterdam
