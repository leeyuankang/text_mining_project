unfortunately the property is undergoing major renovations so not all facilities and lifts are available it is great to see this iconic hotel undergoing major refurbishment and i would be very keen visit to enjoy all the changes we found our original room in the older wing run down and unsuitable when we discussed this with the staff we were moved to a room in the urban wing staff were extremely helpful and polite during this change and we were offered a complimentary drink
