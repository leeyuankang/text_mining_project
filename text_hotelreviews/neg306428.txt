the room we got on the first night was small very dated we looked out at walls there was a loud generator sounding noise we rang down to move or pay for an upgrade we were told they had nothing for the first night but would change us for the second night into an executive suite i asked how much and they said it would be free great went down the next morning to be told that nothing was on the system i explained so the lady gave us a different room in the upgraded section of the hotel with a king size bed ok that s grand they said by the time we get back our room would be ready and they would transfer our bags from the old room to the new one we had to ring reception times to get our bags it took roughly hours the room on the second night was lovely modern airy looked out onto a side street but we were very disappointed at the room they originally gave us if you have an option to upgrade before your arrival i highly recommend you to do it as the old rooms are old
