it s a tourist spot so every time you walk into the hotel or walk out there s loads and loads of people standing right outside the hotel entrance that was rather annoying because it meant having to walk on the road where all the bikes are constantly coming passed or struggling to get through passed all of the people hopefully it s doesn t happen everyday because i m sure to go back to the hotel and this didn t ruin the experience
