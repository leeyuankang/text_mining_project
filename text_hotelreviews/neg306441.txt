i normally stay at the crown plaza but that was fully booked so this was the next best thing but this is not a hotel at the crown plaza you get a good breakfast if your paying for breakfast i d expect the food to be cooked to order not a buffet which is dry and cold the selection was so limited perhaps the dutch believe that everyone eats scrambled eggs chicken sausages over cooked bacon and beans the cereal had a limited selection and options of pastry s i asked the waitress if it was possible to have porridge because i wanted something healthy light and she laughed and said no i didn t realise i said something funny there was one small toaster which only takes two slices of bread at a time and you do it yourself which was a bit of wait as there was a queue the room itself was okay they had options for coffee tea in the bedroom but nothing free like bottle of water or biscuits go with your hot drink
