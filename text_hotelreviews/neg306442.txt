we would not open our balcony door as it had been screwed closed and having no other window in the room we would not get fresh air into our room which was very warm during the day looking out was great but there are nets draped over the balcony to stop birds from sitting on the railings and i felt even more closed in and it actually spoilt the lovely views the bathroom shower should have a glass shower door and the old shower curtain should be removed as the bathroom was lovely except for that ugly shower curtain
