room feels old and has a musky smell on the second night i have to request for room to be clean trice and made a trip to the reception twice to follow up i then just requested for fresh towels to be send instead as it was already late at night at and fresh towels came only mins later breakfast was very minimal other than convenient location choose other hotels instead
