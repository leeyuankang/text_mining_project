the hotel is quite old and it gave the impression that it s not very clean on one of the day i was there housekeeping didn t clean my room completely they didn t throw out the trash in my room so there doesn t seem to be a lot of attention to details you would expect more considering it s quite expensive also the shower is not great basically i think you are paying for the location don t expect much for the room
