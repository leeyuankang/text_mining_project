we were charged two bottles of water which we didn t consume which would mean when the room was prepared for us to occupy the minibar was not properly checked by the staff we didn t scrutinize our bill at checkout so it s also our fault having said that if things were always done perfectly we wouldn t have the need to check would we this is not a complaint nor a negative and didn t mar our stay at plaza victoria we will come back to stay when we next return to amsterdam
