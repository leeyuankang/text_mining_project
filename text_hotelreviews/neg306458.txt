our room was really old and tatty and it wasn t the cleanest i understood the hotel was under construction to improve the hotel but didn t get told that before we booked and we were in the old room it wasn t with the money per night the condition of the room i would stay at this hotel again just a shame we were in one of the tired rooms hopfully all rooms would have been re done for future trips x
