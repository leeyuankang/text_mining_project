not one to moan however on this occasion i was very disappointed i found the staff were not helpful and on numerous occasions came across very rude we also had a member of staff let there self into our room when it had the do not disturb sign which is unacceptable it is not good value for money and i certainly will not be returning to this hotel there was also construction work taking place which we was not made aware off
