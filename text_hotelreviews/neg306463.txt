the room i got was old and fashioned as a wooden two floor attic which made it uncomfortable as i had to use the steep stairs to get to the bedroom the overall space was cramped albeit clean the bathroom was very small and the pillows were somewhat flat meanwhile the reception staff were polite but not very friendly and welcoming with the exception of the breakfast staff who were nice and accommodating for euro per night the price is too expensive for the experience
