we were not advised before travelling by either booking com or the hotel that there is an ongoing refurbishment of the whole hotel noise of drilling and hammering started just after on the first morning and when we complained to the manager we found that they were drilling out a metre of concrete in the basement to fit in a crane the facilities are somewhat limited at present with no real residents lounge just some chairs in the lobby the location could not be more central but because all the tour coaches drop off and pick up outside it is often difficult to make your way through the crowds standing outside to actually get to the hotel door
