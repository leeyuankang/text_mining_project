we were never informed that the hotel was undergoing renovations at the time we made the booking and were awoken by drills each morning of our stay plus the beautiful resident s bar was part of these renovations and therefore unavailable to us we have stayed here before but really would not want to stay here again until all works have been completed i really felt we got very bad value for our money on this occasion
