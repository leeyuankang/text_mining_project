i spent a total of days on the road in northern europe and of all the hotels i stayed at the park plaza was by far the most expensive but the room and hotel amenities were the worst of all my stays the location is great but the hotel is under construction and still charging beyond premium prices small room and small bathroom the bed was uncomfortable and to get to the fitness area required a trip down the elevator across the lobby up an elevator across a hallway and then back down another elevator overall i would recommend looking elsewhere
