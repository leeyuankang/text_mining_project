they way you let us pay euro to stay at a construction site for nights i was woken up by drilling hammering the whole time i was there no warning about this at all ruined my trip it was meant to be a relaxing time off work which turned into getting no sleep for nights we was rushed and kicked out the room that we paid for because the maid wanted to clean it so she could go home maid was very rude and we felt rushed out of our own room
