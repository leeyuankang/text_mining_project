we had a room on the floor at the urban wing facing the centraal station view was great except that the windows are not noise proof so there will still be a little bit of noise from the traffic just outside especially if you are a light sleeper apparently some renovations for the urban wing were still going on above us and we experienced some drilling and knocking noise in the mornings when we were there otherwise the staff were very friendly and helpful esp ms ine the desk manager who offered to compensate us for the discomfort we experienced during our stay
