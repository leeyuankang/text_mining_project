the hotel the rooms and decor were extremely tired and lacking cleaning standards weren t great we took drinks up to the room and the cleaners hid them in the cupboard instead of removing them the photos were misleading very disappointing i wouldn t recommend i think you can get much better for your money else where so disappointing as we decided to book the as a treat and for a bit of luxury but wasn t worth it
