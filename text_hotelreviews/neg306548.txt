very expensive in regards to food and drink if you don t have breakfast built in and fancy ordering it can cost you euros each for a basic breakfast when next door you can visit a caf and get it for also the rooms are quite dark and the bed is the most uncomfortable bed i have ever slept on that much so that it spoilt my nights out as i was so tired as i hadn t got a lot of sleep when in the room
