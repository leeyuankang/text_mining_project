the room was not correct it was old unkept dingy dirty small dark and had a poor view out of the window booking com was awful we had to pay extra at the hotel for the room we had expected first of all but got blamed that the room choice was our own fault it would be so simple to change the layout of the page displaying the room options rather than expecting and hoping for something different to get placed in an awful room and blamed for it it s disappointing and awful that we spent so much money for something so poor the walls leading up to the room had holes in and it was so dark and horrid to look at will never be booking with you again not only that but we were shown a pool and a gym when we got there the pool was closed and had no water in again this was included in the price and we did not get this
