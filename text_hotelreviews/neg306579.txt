i booked this hotel as it had a spa i stayed there for every day i try to book in for a massage and was told to come back at different times the massage lady was never there that was really dispointing also the sauna never worked for the whole time of our stay so really this hotel did not have a spa on the times we stay there there was one day our room never got clean
