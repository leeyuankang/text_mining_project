the room was very basic and extremely small we have been to this hotel about or times now and this was the worst room we ve ever had the air conditioning unit or something was right outside our window which was really noisy there was no view whatsoever which was awful considering it was new year s eve so we could not see any fireworks from our room we could see absolutely nothing a very poor room
