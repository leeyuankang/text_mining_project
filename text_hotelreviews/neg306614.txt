the lady at the breakfast lounge on the at was very worried it seemed that i would not pay our breakfast i walked in she told me there was no credit card depo told her no we left a cash depo wanted to sit and eat had already given my room number was asked to fill out a form i did but told her anyways my husband would pay cash i must say though the lady has no clue about basic good service or manners if you go in any restaurant you pay after not when you walk in also after not a single waiter came to clean up the plates when they asked me due to the buffet closing if i still wanted anything i said no but that i would apreciate if someone could clear up my husband hardly even had place for his expresso in general this restaurant personel left a bad impression
