carpets on the coridors very old and smel s very bad at the check in staff sound very rude and arrogant with explaining hotel rules making you sign the regulation form asking for imediate payment protection charging amount for the room bar very uncomfortable feeling at the begining of your stay there they should do better and is the shame that first impresion looks bad other than that location is in very good place staff is very friendly food very good shame that for the activities like in big city like this after all day shooping you need relaxation and the sauna and swiming pool are closed at overall fair experience
