two annoying things really in our room there was no traditional bedside lamp but instead individually controlled spotlights above the bed this looks good but it makes it harder for one person to stay up and the other sleep the spotlights are just too bright and harsh also at the main entrance the only one we saw there are four steps inside the door we had to lift up our son s stroller and carry them up and down the steps now there is a fold away lift for disabled people but i think you would need to ask the staff to set it up for you it would be a hassle and would slow you down for that reason i probably wouldn t stay here again unless i was comfortable using steps
