hotel needed a little tlc our room had ripped and marked wallpaper and iron burns in the carpet unfortunately our room was also next to the staircase and so every time someone went down the stairs with suitcases it would echo into our room which made sleeping a little difficult i also requested a room with a good view we were given a view of the room opposite which was disappointing
