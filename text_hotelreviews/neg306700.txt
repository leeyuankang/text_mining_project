i did not feel as welcomed by the staff as in other hotels i had stayed at the room and the bathroom were tiny i had to stand back to be able to shave because the wash basin area was too tight to maneuver so was the shower the window in the room opened up to the middle of the building so there was zero view i should have booked the urban room but for the price i paid for the superior it was definitely not worth it
