when i made the booking i asked for a big bed but i was given two single beds instead so i had to request a change to the room which the reception desk first said it will take an hour at pm and then when she saw me upset she gave me another one imemdiately carpet in the new room was so dirty and the room did not have any view contradictory to what i asked for no slippers in the room knowing that the carpet is dirty
