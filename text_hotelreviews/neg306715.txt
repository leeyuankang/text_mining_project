hotel room given was in the old building rug is very old so are the amenities in the room didn t not appear to be a upscale hotel downstairs is beautiful if you arrive request the new building because you will be disappointed in the old building for what you pay for expensive but substandard appearance also i wanted a massage asked the front desk they directed me to the spa went to the spa and the clerk said he just started he didn t know if they did them went back to the front desk and was told oh if they don t do them then i don t know you can check with the concierge staff should have knowledge of devices within the hotel turns out that the hotel has a company contracted that comes from outside and does massages in the room
