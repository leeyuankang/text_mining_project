some of the staff were a bit miserable and rude the pool was broken for a few days the superior rooms need to have their names changed as there is nothing superior about them they are ridiculously small they count the bathroom in the room dimensions in some rooms you have to shuffle past the foot of the bed or commando roll over it to access the rest of the room they should not be advertised the way they are i feel as though it is false advertisement and they certainly are not big enough to fit in a double bed which literately had the head against the wall the foot almost touching the opposite wall which was also the entrance to the bathroom and was placed immediately where you open the door to the room simply not good enough
