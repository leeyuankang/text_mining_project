at first we were given a room that looked like it belonged in a cheap motel after requesting a change we were given a decent room with a nice view the room was a bit dated and worn but it was much better than what we were first shown it s a big busy place and staff is quick and impersonal because there is always someone waiting behind you to get their turn it looks like a beautiful building on the outside i was expecting the same on the inside
