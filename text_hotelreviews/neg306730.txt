i had a problem after i did my reservation and i called back the hotel reservation department directly they couldn t help me with my problem due to hotel policy which i totally understand but making fun of me and being rude on the phone is not acceptable at all my reservation was non refundable so couldn t do anything about it though i would never stay at such place after being treated on the phone like that i called the hotel months before my arrival and i still remember the guy name due to his rude and disrespectful answers patrick
