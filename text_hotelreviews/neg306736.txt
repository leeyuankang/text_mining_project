there was a distinct lack of information regarding the basics to ensure the guest is aware of all facilities available to them for their comfort upon arrival a small but detailed pamphlet to inform guests of these essentials would be helpful with an explanation there should not be an assumption that all guests are aware or know how to work all components of your hotel the hotel wasn t especially clean or special to justify the prices it sets poor value for money oh and breakfast is set at a ridiculously pretentious price as are the sundries in the fridge lack of attention to your guests completely extremely poor customer service for per person per night
