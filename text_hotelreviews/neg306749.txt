most of it the room was old probably decorated in the s the corridor was dark and the carpets were old and had a must smell the bath was too short to use and the towel rail was at head height about ft away when taking a shower the hot breakfast was poor with hard bacon and waffles being kept in warmers too long the staff in the restaurant were not friendly or efficient when i complained about my room i was told there was a more modern one available but the bed had separate mattresses very poor value for money i wrote a complaint to the hotel and the response was to justify rather than correct
