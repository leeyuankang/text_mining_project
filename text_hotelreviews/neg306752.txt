booked because had stayed in new part of hotel previously and loved it came back and booked again only to be put in a room in the old part of hotel with stains on the floor stains on the bed a room where you had to go up a set of stairs and then down a set of stairs to get to with a view of a wall barely any natural light and a nasty smell was moved after we complained but to a slightly better room the first night and then a nicer room the second night due to availability also had to put down euros as a deposit upon arrival as well as signing a disclaimer which seemed pretty unfriendly was told if i paid it on card it would have to come back in cash and only in euros so you would be screwed by the exchange charges of your currency isn t euros i wasn t aware of this before arriving so wasn t happy the breakfast was below average for a hotel often queues at the desk the old part of the hotel is pretty tired and scruffy bath was small and shower not powerful i wouldn t go back
