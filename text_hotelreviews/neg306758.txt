the staff had a bad experience even after booking in january i arrived after lots of flight delays and paid a full rate of euros including the deposit when i arrived i was very confused as i had stayed previous in january and my girlfriend must of sorted the deposit out or i was not told as i had no idea about the euro deposit as it wasnt very clearly displayed on booking com until after i booked and check an email with small print that was fine but i was told i could not sort it out then and the guy told me to take a seat and come sort it out in a min as i was holding the que up i suffer with severe panic attacks and anxiety i started to cry and panic as all staff looked at me as if i was doing something bad my mental health was quite bad so decided to go on holiday as its my birthday monday and i m turning i booked wig victoria as i go to amsterdam a lot on business and to see friends the moment i arrived at the hotel i felt unwelcome and unwanted and kept being told to take a seat so the other guests could not see me cry eventually after panic i handed my phone over to the receptionist who told my mother who i ring in panic that i could not use her card for the deposit i was told he would just take today s money but i didn t want to just book for one day incase i didn t have it sorted the next day and if i wanted to get up before check out i eventually had the money transferred and felt the staff to be extremely unhelpful and rude unlike when i stayed the first time this was not a great start to my holiday and paying euro for a can of drink for the mini bar is not what i expected either i was not pleased with the room as there was a step infront of the door and i tripped falling into the door and hurting my head the second day after popping outside for some lunch and a ciggettette i arrived to the whole road being shut with no access to the hotel no money on me and all my stuff inside the room
