i actually booked my stay for july and for some health reasons i had to reschedule my trip to sometime later during winter i contacted booking and the hotel thru booking to amend the dates but they refused i was disappointed and i thought i will have a better reply note that the amount was taking after confirming the booking yes i know that my deal was nonrefundable however there is always a chance to be helpful and cooperative i was only asking to change the dates not to cancel the whole booking
