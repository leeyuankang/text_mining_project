as mentioned above the calamity with our room upgrade was annoying and then the rooms themselves were appalling the service from the first guy who checked us in was bizarre he droned on and on making small talk failed to make up for their own system error told us he had checked us into the best of the superior rooms and it was just awful the rooms and decor are extremely tired with chips and chunks out of walls skirting boards and doors ugly furniture just horrible absolutely depressing the floor we were initially on before paying for an upgrade smelled awful like mould or mildew or something just horrid as others have said the floors are like rabbit warrens you can easily get lost the rooms are quite noisy being right on the street front way way way over priced aud per night for that no thanks never again worst value for money to me this hotel is more like a star the only star part is the lobby the rest is so far below any star i ve ever stayed in its not even funny how they can get off charging the rates they do i don t know also their ad on booking com is misleading i will post a photo makes it sound like spa use and massages are included when in fact by spa they mean everyday normal hotel facilities like the gym and pool haha shameful absolutely misleading we booed this star at an outrageous price despite the photos hinting it may be less than our idea of comfortable on the basis we would each have a free massage at the end of a long holiday to make up for it no such luck this place was a total let down on all fronts i urge you not to stay here there are much nicer places to stay in amsterdam for literally half the price we chose this one for the city location being only a one night layover on our way home but we re kicking ourselves for it now should have stayed out in an inner suburb like we did last time
