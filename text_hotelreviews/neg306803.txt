they havent understood that hotel comes from hospitality because we have been arriving late i had emailed them to make sure they would reserve a room with bath tub for us well they didnt i told the receptionist that i had emailed when we checked in but all he cared was why i thought his colleagues had made a mistake i can live without a bath tube but their attitude is regretable the last morning the maid banged against our door before am informing us that we have to check out official checkout time is until pm i told them in their survey about this and they responded quite nicely offering us an upgrade next time however they insisted that it was our fault that we arrived late to sum it up they dont really care about their guests we travel a lot and stay in all kinds of places so it is not about the comfort and friendliness and hospitability can make up for much yet they lack these qualities in my eyes since the place is a bit outdated and truly clairaudient i cannot recommend
