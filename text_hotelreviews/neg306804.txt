the room was a bit dated and need to be refurbished we picked this hotel because of its central location and spa swimming pool otherwise we would have chosen a hotel which was cheaper also it didn t have any parking for bicycles which meant we had to leave the bikes at another hotel the movenpick which has excellent secure bike parking
