one of the pricier hotels in the city centre but no worse than comparable hotels in other cities breakfast was euros per person per day if booked in advance bit pricey but good quality and plentiful it might work out cheaper to take the breakfast included option when making the booking there are plenty of cafes restaurants bars nearby if you want to go even cheaper watch out for the option to get a reduction on food if you forego daily towel linen replacement this applies only to evening meals and bar in the hotel not to breakfast which is charged separately
