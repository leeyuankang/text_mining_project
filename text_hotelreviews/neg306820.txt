we booked the hotel because we thought the rooms looked so nice in pictures and we wanted to have a romantic luxury stay when booking i was asked if i prefer a room with a sea view and uppercase i marked yes i even booked the more expensive room we got a room on the first floor the room was ok but nothing compared to any pictures we had seen the bathroom was tiny and hair drier was not working as we were only staying there for one night we didn t have time to ask them to move us to a different room
