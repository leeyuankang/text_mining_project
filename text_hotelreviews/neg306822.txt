we were offered a room in either the traditional or more modern wing of the hotel and given the opportunity to change if we wanted we chose the traditional wing and stayed in room whilst it was comfortable and clean it was quite a depressing looking room with windows looking at back of house walls right up close we weren t going to be spending much time in the room over the two days so didn t bother to change
