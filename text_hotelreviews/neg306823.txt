deceptive advertising of star rating that can only be described as a tired run down hotel worthy of no more than stars the cost for three days can only be for the location because there was nothing else worth mentioning we we given a small back room with a very worn out bed after complaining we were moved to another room which although better was still worn and tired the hotel has two sections one obviously newer and better appointed there was no mentioned of the difference between hotel room standards on booking com except the room description e g superior room clearly there is no quality checking done of hotel premises by booking con very disappointed and spoiled our first visit to amsterdam
