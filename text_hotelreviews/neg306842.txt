unhelpful staff that chose to just see you struggle with luggages and baby strollers up the steps to the hotel reception and down the steps to the hotel exit door every day i was there for days and no offer of help front desk personnel was cold imagine coming in from a hr travel only to be told that you have to buy a bottle of mineral water as the hotel do not provide any complimentary water this is the first hotel that i know of within the same categories of hotel that does not provide a complimentary bottled mineral water in the room the checking out time is noon and not even a slight extension till is allowed this i can understand and most of the time is due to in coming guests checking in at thus require the room but to be told that i have to pay for that hour of extension just reaffirmed my belief that service is last on this hotel s list
