this hotel is nowhere near a star hotel i don t think it s worth a star the room smelled the floorboards creek throughout the room i was in and above the sheets were like sand paper and bed very hard and lumpy the front desk staff was very unfriendly doing you a big favour i wouldn t recommend this hotel and i have stayed at many a hotels in all my years of travel
