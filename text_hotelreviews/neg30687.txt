they lied outright and by doing so made us all sign up to the ihg rubbish they told us that this will give us cheaper rates and late check outs as well as priority bookings but no such thing i ve had this ihg for a few months and it has been the biggest nightmare and a front for the staff at both holiday inn and staybridge suites to embarrass us as if we didn t graduate from university and wouldn t understand their poor unfounded claims for why we aren t entitled to the very elements we were promised by becoming a member the price via ihg is always extortionate compared to booking com and this will only give you some points of which you need more extortionate stays before you may qualify for a free night via booking com you would have managed to save enough money to have got extra nights for free after paying for via money saved
