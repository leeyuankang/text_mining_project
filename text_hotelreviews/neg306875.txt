when the receptionist discovered i was travelling alone i was allocated a very poor room with single beds stained carpets and in the attic i refused this room as i had proof of advance payment for a superior room which the receptionist chose to ignore on my arrival i had to complain before i was allocated the correct standard of room also the housekeeping staff appeared just after on my departure day and asked me to vacate the room on a sunday morning
