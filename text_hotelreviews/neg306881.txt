this has to be the worst experience i have ever had in a hotel in my life of travel i ve been offended the receptionist tried to rob me and the rudeness of the staff unbelievable except tania the duty manager she is the nicest person in the hotel or in amsterdam just to get your attention to the problems i faced i got scammed with the room i booked an executive double room through booking com which is not the cheapest room there but i want to treat myself good in my long waited vacation the room is amazing in pictures however the room that they gave me was an ancient room really old and does not look like the room in the pictures so i talked to the receptionist her name is ine about this and she started to convince me that my room is a good room and that it has a coffee machine in it i said that i appreciate the gesture but no thanks so she tried to push me into paying for an upgrade and she kept insisting on it after she failed convincing me she gave me an urban wing room smaller and cheaper room with no sort of compensation other than breakfast coupons for days not even for the full stay smoking in the room on the first night marieangela and her colleague came to my room with a bad attitude felt like i broke into the hotel not paid for the room she kept shouting about me smoking in the room i told her that i respect the rules and i asked at the front desk if the hotel does have a smoking room and they said no so i didn t and will not smoke in the room she threatened to call the police and throw me out of the hotel if i didn t pay the fine so i had to comply as i have just arrived from a long day of traveling and i didn t want to sleep in the streets as all the other decent hotels are either fully booked or triple the rate for such short notice mariangela has shouted at me threatened me and gave me the attitude of you are not welcome in this hotel
