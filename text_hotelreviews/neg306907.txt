maid did not leave toilet roll during our stay so we ran out on the last night friends we went with were disappointed with the view as it looked into the other side of the hotel only other thing was the smell in the hall way when the cleaners had hoovered i think you need a new hoover but other than that it was perfect for us these things did not really effect our time spent in amsterdam
