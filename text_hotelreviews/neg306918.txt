pool was closed half our stay i booked mainly because of the pool and sauna so with it being closed limited us even more with what we could use unless we paid extra for use of beauty salon massage etc also didn t get a room i asked for got put on the floor with nothing but a grotty outlook onto someone else s window and a roof with vents on it
