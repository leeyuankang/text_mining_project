i upgraded from urban room to executive room although prompted to reconsider by helpful receptionist but when you decide to change from a standard room to executive you d expect more for your money the bathroom was really a big disappointment tiles and floor looked old and dated and the room wasn t very lit or welcoming this remember was a executive room so anyone considering to purchase this upgrade do not all you will get is king size bed and a couch with little extra space
