the room was extremely basic and dated the bath was to small lol i was expecting a bit more for the price we paid breakfast was euro per person considering the cafes do a lovely one for euro you would need to be able to do a few runs at the buffet to justify the cost the gym was very very basic and upon arrival we gad to pay an extra euro as an insurance for the room which if you had budgeted for the cost of the room only youd be sunk value for money id advise looking elsewhere
