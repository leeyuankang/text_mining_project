after booking my hotel i recived an upgrade offer i requested the offer and upon arrival i was given the upgrade to the urban room after going inside i noticed there were single beds in the room no one even at the reception told me anything about the single beds i don t sleep in single bed i had to go back to the reception and request a different room which was not available so i ended back in my original room i was really looking forward to my upgrade which i did not get i didn t recive a complimentary drink or apology for the inconvenience which was a disappointed i was then charged for a bottle of water out of the fridge
