the d cor was not reflective of a star hotel the bathroom was dirty with hair and dust on arrival and the paint was chipped on the walls all over the bedroom the smart television did not work for the internet and although it had a usb point into it this did not work either this is quite surprising for a hotel used to accommodate business clients
