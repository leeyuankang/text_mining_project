a star hotel absolutely overpriced the room crying for some make over to bring it into the century staff was rather arrogant than service oriented starting with the check in and ending with the concierge but the clue was that you have to beg if you want to use the rest rooms in the lobby area they are locked by card to avoid tourists using them which is understandable but i believe the easiest way would be to contract more people controlling the access to the hotel a bit better for the security of the guests but also to grant an atmosphere different to the one you have opposite in the railway station and if guests than complain you should not give them a lecture that s how i felt i stayed in lots of different hotels in amsterdam that one was with distance a really bad experience
