the staff were absolutely awful especially the hotel manager at check out he took my money off my card in a secluded place without me being present or getting my authorisation and refused to give me a break down of what i m paying for he inflated the price because i left two days early so i ended up paying the same amount as if i had stayed the full time i booked all in all everyone was very dishonest and they all kept contradicting themselves
