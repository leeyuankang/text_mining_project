a few things about the hotel are unfortunately quite negative general the hotel looks run down and like something that is barely surviving on the value of its location and name beyond that it is quite dark dingy and dirty looking better alternative is the arthotel right next door part of the same group specifics about the rooms and experience room nr we booked a room with two single beds we arrived and it was a double room the room we had received was dirty i e the bed looked like someone lay in it and towels were lying on the bathroom floor room nr thankfully we complained and were given another room but in this room the minibar didn t work we told reception this who promised to fix it the next day this didn t happen the carpet was in need of serious cleaning
