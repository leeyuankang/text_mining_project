i found the afternoon evening staff a little unwelcoming after i returned to the hotel one evening a lady asked me what i was doing in the hotel and if i was lost i can only assume she thought the hotel was too good for me which i find quite rude it may have been because i was wearing a rugby top but who knows i told her i was staying in the hotel and she looked me up and down and said oh right and left quite rude
