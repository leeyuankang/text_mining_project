it was degrees in the room with air conditioning not working and no way of cooling the room as no windows when i alerted staff to this they already knew but still put us in that room the second night we asked for something to be done and we did get another room which was fine i was very disappointed that we had to ask to be changed to another room as this should not have happened at all i paid around and should have got better we did love the hotel but felt let down by being put in a overheated room
