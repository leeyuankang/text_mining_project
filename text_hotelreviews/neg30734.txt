the food in the restaurant at dinner was poor and we had to complain for that reason we did not dine there on subsequent evenings breakfast selection was good but each morning we had to wait for one or other items which had run out yes they were always replaced but by the time they were the item on the plate already chosen were cold not a smooth or seamless service at all
