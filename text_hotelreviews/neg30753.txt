one evening we had a fire evacuation at am it was badly organised the evacuation message was switched off the escape stair was full of people not knowing what to do and not moving out of the building we did not see anyone from the staff we had moved from floor to by this time word of mouth came from below it was a false alarm so people started back up the stairs i found a phone and rang reception to ask what was the situation i was told it was indeed a false alarm i asked why a tannoy message had not been put out to this effect to reassure the guests to be told they did not have one not there finest hour
