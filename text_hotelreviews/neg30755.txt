this was not to do with the hotel more the stewards on duty after the match we tried to get back from the london stadium to the hotel via chestnut plaza but a temporary gate had been erected we were told we weren t allowed through and would have to queue with all the people trying to get to stratford station in order to access the hotel from that direction there was a small group of people who were staying at holiday inn staybridge and luckily for us a determined lady kept at the steward until he agreed to let us through as the queues of people waiting to get off westfield avenue onto montifichet road were huge and it would have taken my year old daughter and i a long time to battle through
