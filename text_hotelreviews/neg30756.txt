we went to the west ham match and on matchdays access to the hotel afterwards is difficult the main entrance to westfield nearest the ground is shut after the game and you have to walk all the way around by stratford international then as the escalator was broken a long flight of stairs which was a nightmare for an elderly father once on top a short walk to the hotel not holiday inn s fault but an issue they need to address with westfield
