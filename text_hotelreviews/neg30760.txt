we arrived late after very tired and all we wanted was to get our room and go to sleep upon check in we had to wait for minutes for our reservation to be found once we received the key card and went to our room on floor the key card did not work we went back downstairs and the receptionist gave us another key which did not work as well then we went downstairs for the second time and one of the staff members finally decided to accompany us and opened the room with the master card the only thing is there was someone else already in the room asleep not a pleasant experience especially considering how tired we were and what a hassle it was to get our room
