there was no mention of renovations on the hotel restaurant which meant very loud noise and vibrations in our room we had booked this as our last hotel and wanted something relaxing and indulgent but we were unable to sleep and had to leave the room during the day also the room is very tiny and doesn t look at all like the size in the photos and obviously no room service or breakfast available
