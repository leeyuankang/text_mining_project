the hotel is currently under construction re modelling if i had known this before booking i wouldn t have booked drilling every morning that vibrated throughout the whole hotel from onwards very small and basic rooms so small that the bathroom door doesn t fully open because of the bed definitely not worth per night no bar or restaurant as it s under construction feel this hotel ruined our trip i m sure there s better hotels in this city for the money this defiantly isn t a star hotel
