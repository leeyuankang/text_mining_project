i apsolutely didn t like the fact we didn t get an email to tell us the hotel lobby and dining area was being refurbished it was my partners birthday on our last morning there and i wanted to treat him to a breakfast in the hotel disappointing i m afraid in my opinion and also other guests that i heard comments from this was a major inconvenience and one that was unexpected warrants compensation
