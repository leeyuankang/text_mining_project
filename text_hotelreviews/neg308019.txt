the hotel did not fulfill their reservation for a standard twin room and instead put me in a very small single room on the top floor the view was a brick wall and they said well it s already paid and the room difference is only per night the hilton has better rooms and similar rates for a slightly longer walk the hotel does not have bike rental deals with black bike the biggest in centraal and no racks for guests though there is great bike parking across the street the restaurant has good food but my steak and potatoes was not worth and i left with for one person of which was liquor
