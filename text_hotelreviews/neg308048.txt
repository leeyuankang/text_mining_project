one particular staff at the reception lady maybe a supervisor i m not sure definitely not claudia or another younger lady this particular lady most probably in early or late she commented that i could not bring any food to the lobby so i told her that the food is to be brought up to the room she made some gestures with her hand faces like talking to a little kid which i think is unnecessary we were guests paid in advance of the hotel not school kid staying in a hostel
