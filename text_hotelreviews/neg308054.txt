paid a high price for a tiny room off a narrow corridor the thin walls meant i could hear the doors of other rooms constantly slamming shut which was extremely annoying city tax is added separately and the actual price you end up paying to the hotel in euros once the exchange rate is factored in is much higher than the price originally quoted in sterling on booking com having stayed at the hotel a number of times in the past it would have been a nice gesture to be better looked after
