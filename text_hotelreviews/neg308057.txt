noisy i had a quiet room on a back alley and even that was noisy it is in a very busy noisy area of town plus there was a fair on the square while i was there and to top it off a staff member mistakenly called my room at am rooms are very small awful lighting in the bathroom i would not normally notice this detail but it was really very hard to see
