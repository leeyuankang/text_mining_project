we stayed in this hotel for four nights it seems that the standard rooms are not standard for the first night the room we stayed was really small no space to move around after putting a luggage on the floor the worse is the fact that the only window is facing a back staircase however we raised our queries why the photos shown in the website were different to reality we were then accommodated to another room for the rest of the stay besides the toilet is very small with a little shower area the floor is wet after showering
