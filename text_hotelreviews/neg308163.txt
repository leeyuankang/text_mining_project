see above booking com did not give us what i think i booked and cost was a high euro conversion rate to for nights was unaware of local tax of till it was presented on bill so booking com got it very wrong for me and we were just lucky there was other rooms free and helpful staff i don t plan to use booking com again as i thought i was booking through easyjet
