we d requested a twin bed room but the beds were pushed together i asked reception to help us separate the beds but they wouldn t so i had to do it which was hard as they were heavy and i had a sore shoulder there was no mirror over the vanity in the room so make up and hair had to be done in the bathroom which isn t ideal when you are sharing the bathroom there was a strong smell of drains in the bathroom which i didn t mention to reception as they had been unhelpful with the bed situation so i felt they wouldn t do anything about that either the lobby is small and you have no sense that you are in a star hotel i don t think there is a bar there is just an adjoining cafe i didn t see any communal areas if it wasn t for the location i wouldn t choose to stay at this hotel
