the room was suffocating with no proper windows the toilet has a musky smell which makes it worse for me since i was not well during the stay further the thing about the toilet door is such that it is always closed by default even when not in use in this way hard to ventilate and get rid of the musky smell since the door must remain closed the main hotel room door and toilet door should have fixed a stopper for ease of movements
