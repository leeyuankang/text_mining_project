the staff is not so helpful they are kind but they just provide your basic things whenever you ask something extra they easily say no for instance the pillows are very soft in the rooms and when you ask a harder one they say they can not provide as they don t have in stock in the second day i had to warn them to rate their service as negative in booking com and they have brought immediately another instance is that they have not provided an armless chair to my room as the present one was too tight for me i believe they don t want to provide these kind of things i don t think i can stay there again
