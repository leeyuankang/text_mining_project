the room and the bathroom were so small that it was very difficult for my husband and i to navigate at the same time the bathroom was only big enough for one person we did not pick the lowest price room specifically for that reason honestly the room would have been much better for a single person also there was no view at all in fact the window was so high up that even if there had been a view we would not have been able to see anything
