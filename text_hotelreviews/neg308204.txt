for the price we could have done much better the room was noisy as ours was the last room next to the staff s room they bang around and the walls are quite thin so you hear everything they slam the doors every minutes so they are busy but its annoying when you are on a na time zone we only went for breakfast once in the hotel it was over priced and all the hot items were cold as there was no heat turned on under them maybe an over site by the staff but we did not come back there are lots of other places to get breakfast so we went out the rest of our stay
