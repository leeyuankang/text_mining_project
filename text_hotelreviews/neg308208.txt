i mistakenly left some of my wife s clothes hung up in the wardrobe when we left on return my wife rang the hotel to ask if they had been handed in so that she could pay the postage for them to be forwarded on she was told no that was it just no my wife was a bit taken back by this and asked if they were sure as they had definitely been left there with that she had the phone put down on her a part from being dam right rude this would imply that either they had been taken from the room by staff or that the room had not been cleaned before the guests staying after us occupied it either way a more sympathetic response from customer services would have been nice
