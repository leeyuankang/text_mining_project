good as the location is it s like living ontimes square very busy very touristy there were cleanliness issues that i requested to be cleaned i had to ask the desk twice and when they did it they only dealt with one of the four i also never like it when hotels have don t mention that they have breakfast choices off a menu for a lot less money than the buffet breakfasts but a lot of hotels do that
