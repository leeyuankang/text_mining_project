it seemed from the add at bookin com that breakfast was included suggesting it as a special offer it was on our checking out that we understood it was not the case never were we told about the price for breakfast we didnt ask as we thought it is included and never was it mentioned that it is not included and whilst checking out we understood this was the case the staff at reception said they have mentioned it before which was not the case and the whole discussion was not in the lovely spirit of the hotel at all otherwise the hotel was lovely and it was a pity
