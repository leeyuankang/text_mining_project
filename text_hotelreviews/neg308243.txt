staff upon arrival our arrival at pm were not so welcoming insisted upon taking both my child s and my passport out of my view to photocopy even though the room was paid in full with my cc through the secure booking com website they insisted on my producing a cc to authorize for incidentals and to prove the card was there staff could not explain what incidentals or what or whom the proof was for exasperating and unnecessary when you just want to drop your bags and relax when we get to the room there is a menu card for many different types of pillows to request from the front desk free of charge when we call we are informed that all the pillows were taken for the night why not remove the card when you are advertising something that is not available then we realized that we left a bag in the lobby that contained an ipad in a panic we rush down and they had it behind the desk very strange that staff would not bring the bag up immediately or at least phone us to have us come down very poor customer service overall
