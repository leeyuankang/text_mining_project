we booked a room with a kingsize bed but got one with two single beds the person at the reception said that there were no more rooms available it was late and we had no choice than to accept the room wich was so under swissotel standards the next morning we complained to the manager in charge and she helped us to change the room the newer one was much more modern with a kingsize bed as we wished to have one it s sad to know that if we had not complained about the situation no one would help us out
