there was a recently hired room attendant who searched through our stuff most likely looking for money or small valuable items we immediately reported the incident to the hotel manager and were pleased to see that the management started a highly professional internal investigation asap they checked who entered our room and the video recordings in the hotel they let us know that the person who searched through our personal staff was a recently employed room attendant who failed to show up at work the next day apparently this person was not hired directly by swissotel but he was working for a company providing room attendants to hotels in amsterdam this was the only discomfort however i must say it was enough for us to decide not to stay at swissotel again in the future the hotel only presented apologies for the incident and did not try to compensate in any other way
