didn t like that breakfast wasn t included in charge of room and had to be paid for separately also is a bit expensive for the breakfast that was provided it was in the neighbouring hotel granted as swiss tel kitchen was being refurbished but i feel it was a bit of a let down only thing i can fault in the whole hotel
