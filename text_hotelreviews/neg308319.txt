the facilities are in need of a total makeover we stayed on the floor in which you could hear that the air handler needed a tune up the room was very dated though immaculate in its cleanliness the room had too much furniture in it for a room of its size also the bathroom had a large soaker tub in a room that would have been much more comfortable with a shower the restaurant was closed for remodeling which is a good sign the decision to lease the street front portion of the building out which i m sure is a nice money maker left the poor hotel with a tiny lobby completely out of touch with what people are looking for in a modern business hotel i hope they reconsider that and remodel the lobby in the future as you couldn t ask for a better location
