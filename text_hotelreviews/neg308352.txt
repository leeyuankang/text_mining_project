states non smoking but guests were smoking and you could smell it the room size was poor and the bed size requested was wrong i asked for a twin room with two single beds and ended up with a double bed and a single at the bottom of the bed which i kept bumping into as it was in the way bath was dirty so as stayed for one night did not use it grouting around bath was very poor standard and i stayed at the hotel amsterdam next door but one two weeks previous and that was cheaper and was a much better hotel
