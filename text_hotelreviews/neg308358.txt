well i had a reservation half an hour before i checked with booking com for bed only after checking in there was a walk in guest and asked for a room and they told him including breakfast so i asked if i can get this rate so they told me no because my reservation was non refundable and they even didn t try to upgrade me or even gave me breakfast so booking com tricked me and the hotel even didn t try to make me satisfied
