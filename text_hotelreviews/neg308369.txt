the fact that the room is a bit different from the picture on the site i took the premium and i was a bit disappointed also the fact that the hotel was under renovations and they forgot to tell us only after we got there i have to say that only when we left and we got up early we could have heard the drilling finally it is more of a global problem of booking com i didnt know that we would need to pay extra money regardless to the room price for city taxes if you mentioned it earlier that would be great
