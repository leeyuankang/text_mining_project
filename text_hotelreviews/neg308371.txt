the room was cramped and we had to ask for another chair or one sat on bed and one in chair the fact that we had to go to the hotel next door but one for breakfast as renovations were going on in lounge and bar we were not told this on booking otherwise we would not have stayed there it was inconvenient as weather bad but we couldn t stay in the lounge as there wasn t one so we had to pay to stay in the dry by buying coffee etc
