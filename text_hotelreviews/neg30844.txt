my partner turned on the tv so we could relax and watch some tv before we went out there was no instructions with the tv we saw at the bottom of the home page on the tv it said press the red button for channels but when my partner pressed it nothing happened and no channels came up so i m not sure if there are any channels you can watch or not we bought some extra milk for a cup of tea as we found that of those little pots weren t enough when we got back to the room we realised that they don t have fridges in there but we had the air conditioning on so cold that it kept our milk cold
