they gave us a funny bed sheets at start sadly it is way too expansive for a small room and small bathroom the management should look into that it feels the amount of money which i paid too high for the room type i selected the bathroom door open outward it was dangers when someone standing outside or opening the room door therefore there was a clashing i advise to switch it to sliding i tried the breakfast and it was not to great not much selection other cafes around the hotel are better also the outdoor cafe was not welcoming for such a great location it should have improved would i come to the hotel again yes because of the staff and if they lower the cost to match the actual size of the room
