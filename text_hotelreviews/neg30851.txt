no one cared for the fire alarm at we were awake but my and yo daughters weren t happy this was the drunk idiot with the toaster oven s fault not the staff this being said the staff was very organized and got the job done had there been a fire though i suspect the location would ve prevented a large response because the crowd of guests had no where to go in the confined area outside
