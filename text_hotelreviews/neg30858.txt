breakfast was really disorganised no bowls were out staff were running around someone brought out four bowls one was left at the central counter another lady picked that up the other three were taken to another table eventually i managed to get a member of staffs attention and a bowl was brought out to me the milk urn was empty i managed to tip just enough out a coffee was offered to me and i was told it would be cold if it was too cold to ask for another i got up to get the cooked breakfast the beans were burnt on black to the base of the serving dish the rest off the buffet was really low i got back to my table that had been totally striped so i asked for cultlery i was offered another coffee which was better you really need to look at how you can keep all the food and crockery topped up the second day i didn t bother taking breakfast because of the experience never had such bad service in an holiday inn i feel that i have paid for something that was not worth it
