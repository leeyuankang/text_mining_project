they did not have the executive room which i had booked weeks in advance was given a small room and when i complained i was then given a room obviously designed for a disabled guest not really what i wanted for a birthday celebration room also didn t have many of the so called in room extras listed on the booking form it would seem that they can t cope when they are busy and then try to fob you off with any room and hope you don t notice the difference
