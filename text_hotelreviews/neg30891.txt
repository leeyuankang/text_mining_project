cumberland sausages are not great toast station needs to be moved away from the corner of the breakfast room as it gets very congested with people trying to get to the pastries jam and toaster the bed was a bit too firm but it s ok lighting levels in the room are poor without both bedside lights being on the tv starts with a load of corporate blurb high volume and finding how to switch it off and get the tv on was not easy also when selecting the tv guide it always came up with lots of no information against the channels so it was difficult to find anything as each channel had to be selected before you could see what was on
