the price was hiked through the ceiling because of the event we were attending being on is extortionate for one night i ve stayed in much nicer hotels for half this price also the staff didn t seem to be able to cope with so many guests especially the hotel bar the chap who seemed to be in charge was in an obvious flap and in the short time i was there he short changed one of my party and i witnessed another lady being given more change after questioning her bill while i was waiting for my drinks to be served this does not give a good impression
