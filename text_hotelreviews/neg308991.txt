we were not informed about the construction going on in the hotel before and i was in shock when we were there see pictures although they said it will be between noise started at in the morning we could not even open the door because it was covered due to construction see from pictures if i knew i would definitely pick another hotel becase there are many nice hotels around for the same price it was really dissapointing also only three floors in the building belongs to hotel and there was a huge party in floor until since its not part of hotel nobody did anything there was no receptionist and we couldnt sleep that night i also could not connect to their wifi from different devices but this was really a minor problem compared to others overall i do not recommend to stay there at least until construction is over
