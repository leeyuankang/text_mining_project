we weren t given a room until one and a half hours after the designated check in time which coupled together with us arriving a bit early meant that we had to spend our first two hours in amsterdam waiting at a hotel reception while the room we ended up having was on the top floor and it was a larger room one of the executive floors i would have happily stayed in a normal room which was available on time we had booked a standard room more annoyingly the staff kept telling us the room will be ready in minutes once we were in the room it turned out that it wasn t even cleaned properly the only alternative we were given was a room with better disabled access which we didn t want in case somebody else needs it more than us one of our towels was not replaced after the first night and we found the general cleanliness of the room was not great there was rubbish on the balcony from the previous stay
