in january booked and paid for executive rooms for nights injune we arrived early so our rooms were not ready we checked in and left our bags in a locked room at reception on returning to the hotel at we were told they had given away one of our rooms that afternoon and told no other rooms available but had a room available in another hotel as we were travelling with a larger group of people this was not acceptable when we asked to speak to a manager we were told there was none on the premises when the trainee receptionist realised we were not going to go away she went into the room behind reception and would not come out after standing there for over an hour we were given keys to a second executive room unbelievable
