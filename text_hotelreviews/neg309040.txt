staff were very rude and sarcastic when i asked the lady at the reception how long it would take to go to the airport in the morning and how much time in advance do i need to go to the airport the lady was rude and sarcastic and said that as i don t have a private jet and i am a private airport and as i am not the only person flying i should go there early it was not a joking conversation either such sarcasm was not required for a simple question for a new visitor to the city i arrived late as my flight was delayed tired and hungry only to be told that the kitchen was closed and the only thing available was a pizza or cheese platter the location of the hotel is so far from city centre that there was literally no options to eat the receptionist then gave me a website for a local delivery i could order which took more than an hour and half to arrive by which time i was already sleeping i asked for a iron board and a uk plug adapter for which i was told to sign a declaration that i would be charged euro s if not returned or damaged the adapter never worked in the first place and i had to go to reception everytime to change it to a working one poor service i checked out early in the morning as i had an early flight the receptionist took it upon himself to order a taxi although i had arranged one myself through uber and was upset that i did not take his taxi i would not go back to this hotel and would not recommend if you have a choice stay elsewhere
