unfriendly reception staff i felt judged and looked down upon by them the scrambled eggs were cold in the breakfast and watery the bacon though was delicious bonus points for pastrami as a meat option in the breakfast table it was really good they didn t offer any transportation to amsterdam rai and i had to drive minutes to get there due to roadworks blocking what otherwise would ve been a super easy access
