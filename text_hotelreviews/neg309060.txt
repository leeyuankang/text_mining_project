unfortunately for us the confort was modest to say the least the room was cold due to the ac not working at its fullest and being winter the overall feeling was unpleasant i brought up this aspect to a few members of the staff and all they did was write my room number on a piece of paper and that was it i don t know if all rooms suffered from this but they never got back to me after a while i stopped bothering to complain
