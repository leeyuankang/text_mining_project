the hotel has a star rank but for us it was not a star hotel our room was on the floor and it was very noisy traffic the windows are very thin it was also very cold eventhough the heating was on we also think because of the thin windows also the staff maybe a chance for us but the employees we talked with was new and didn t know a lot of things we had to ask for several things for toilet materials toilet paper toothpaste etc normally in a star hotel this is already in the bathroom and you don t have to ask for it our kettle was broken we lucky got a new one the room was cleaned after the first night but not after the second night and when you choose this hotel with the amount of money you have to pay for you are expecting some luxury and finally on the ground floor there is renovation also very noisy you can not here the employee at the reception you are talking with some employees are very friendly and say they are sorry and some for example when we checked in november are talking very slow and you don t feel welcome it is ofcourse not a bad hotel but with a star hotel it was not what we had expected
