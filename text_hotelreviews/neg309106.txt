hotel restaurant and bar was very expensive we ate out every night at nearby restaurants due to price we only had breakfast there once was very nice all you could eat full english as well as breads and hams too breakfast was each so was okay would recommend to eat out as a burger in the hotel restaurant was and a pint was can get cheaper meals from restaurants nearby or in the central get a tram there
