hostess at breakfast she made every effort to retrieve my cell phone which i had accidentally left on the table and only discovered i had done so when in the lift going up to my room however she then advised lectured me quote the breakfast room is very busy and so you should be careful look after your phone i had just travelled thro time zones in days no one would be deliberately forgetful these things happen especially when one is tired i couldn t see the point of her remarks i think the problem was partly use of language but i also do think she needs to be more empathic guests have come a long way they are frequently tired i dont know that she is really aware of this
