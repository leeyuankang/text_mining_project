a thief on the hotel staff has stolen money from my wife s purse which was with her handbag in a secure room which can only be accessed with a key card she has been left violated and very upset at this the manager did not carry out an immediate check but left it to the next day and them gave a poor excuse with no remorse which does not help my wife this has marred a very good weekend and in an exclusive hotel to which the problem has not been resolved there is a thief on their staff and it will continue until they are caught we will not be staying at this hotel again as my wife and i feel that this was a very poor run hotel in light of this
