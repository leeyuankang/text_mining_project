breakfast was a bit basic processed meat and limited selection of bread and pastries i am gluten free and although the hotel had been informed of this in advance i had to ask for gluten free bread and wait minutes for the barely edible rolls that eventually arrived the hotel is described as being minutes from the centre of amsterdam in reality it was minutes by taxi hardly convenient
