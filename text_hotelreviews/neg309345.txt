very disappointed that we booked a room with a double bed and got singles pushed together there were quilts and every time we rolled over we would become uncovered or the beds would push apart to make things worse when we went to get into bed one only had a sheet folded and placed on it so we had to make our own bed at when we just wanted to sleep this was raised with reception in the morning and noted but no discount or anything was offered we didn t raise it with them at the time as we were unpacked ready for bed and didn t want to have to move rooms
