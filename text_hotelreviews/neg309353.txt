ryrhyms restaurant had good food but extremely slow service although the city centre was easily accessible by metro about minutes and the station is just a brisk minute walk away this hotel is a bit far out if you leave in the morning to explore the city it does not make sense to come back to the hotel unless you are not going to go out again being in the city would make it much more convenient to come back to your room should you wish to rest or change
