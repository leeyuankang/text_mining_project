too much money for a hotel like this but then again ask any amsterdamer they would say well this is normal otherwise don t come to amsterdam go to berlin or paris if you are not happy with the prices this is not customer friendly at all but in amsterdam you pay three times the price of a paris hotel plus you always pay the city tax bloody rip off i hope they really consider it one day which i am skeptical they never will knowing their mentality
