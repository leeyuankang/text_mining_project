the hotel s website should mention the route to the parking lot as it was hard to find had to call the hotel for directions comment of receptionist was that they were working on that for months already idem for booking com should mention the route to the parking lot as it was hard to find music in the bar area of the hotel s restaurant was too loud the hotel s restaurant is rather small with no possibility to make reservations we had an early diner but this could be an issue at normal diner hour as there are no other restaurants in the area
