we had two very good nights but the last one there was a concert in the place next to the hotel all the crowd then stays around the hotels in a couple of bars including the one in the hotel and make some noise the music in the hotel bar was very loud and i could really hear it from the room the breakfast was really less than average the problem is there isn t much options in this neighborhood in the morning you better just take something from the metro train station you need to walk minutes to the closest metro station then it takes minutes to get in the city center depending on your luck
