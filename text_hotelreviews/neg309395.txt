there was nothing i disliked about our stay the first night we hired a taxi from the station to the hotel as we were unfamiliar with the area but as across the whole of the netherlands taxis are expensive compared to the uk learning the minute walk from the friendly and helpful hotel staff saved us the taxi fare for less than a minute drive and enabled us to enjoy the beautiful and quiet walk to the station
