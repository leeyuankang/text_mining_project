the location superb if you re visiting one of the music venues or football stadium however a little far out for tourists to the city saying that the transport was great there is no clear entrance for the hotel we spent mins walking around trying to find the way in on site printing facilities would be a good idea we were unable to check in for our flight until before travel we wouldn t have minded paying a small charge to use a pc printer luckily one of your receptionists helped us out and let us print using your own facilities
