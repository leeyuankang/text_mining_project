no parking available in underground under hotel because of football match etc ridiculous they should reserve spaces for hotel guests no roomservice went downstairs myself to order it myself in the restaurant bring it up but if you give enough tip they will bring it to the room why not offer roomservice then with a charge for that the food usual is very nice there but they brought it up in boxes which made it really bad why not on plates food got cold because they forgot to write down the room number we requested and paid for a late check out had a do not disturb sign up but that did not stop housekeeping to knock on our door twice that afternoon overpriced for a hotel so far outside the city centre rooms are very basic no service
