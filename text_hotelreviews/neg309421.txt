one thing we disliked very much was that the fire alarm went off one morning the sound went off and being that the message was stated in many different languages it took a while before we clearly understood what was going on also as we made our way down to the lobby the staff acted as if they didn t know why many people were down in the lobby when they asked if we were responding to the alarm they stated that it was a false alarm and that we were able to return to the room not a great start to the day
