rude receptionist were initially put in a disabled room on a low floor we did not need a disabled room and had requested a higher floor i know these aren t always available i went to reception as our phone wasn t working in the room to request to be moved to be told point blank that they were completely fully booked and the higher floors were booked for groups who were vips and something to do with drake the singer so they took priority over us the way it was said was very snooty so dismayed a returned to our room after a while me and my husband decided we really were not happy with this room at all so returned to reception to the same receptionist after explaining again and saying we would rather stay in a different hotel she suddenly decided to check to see if there other rooms and ta dah one was available on the floor we moved an the room was fabulous exactly what we had booked it s just a shame it started on a bad note but our stay from then on was faultless apart from the room was a bit chilly i booked this hotel under the impression it was miles from amsterdam city centre all advertised as an amazing location but the day before we realised it was actually nearly miles out this was very disappointing it was then too late to cancel
