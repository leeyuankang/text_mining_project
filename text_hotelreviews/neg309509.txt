we were shocked by the situation at the breakfast there was simply no free place every morning the staff sometimes tried to find a place for some people who were already desperate and claiming but with no much success either there simply aren t enough tables if you re lucky to get a spot it won t be clean and even if you manage to find somebody to clean it they will just make it wet not clean it really has destroyed our stay as we had to do sports every morning trying to find and or fight for a place as also many other guests did for a hotel it is something really unacceptable the staff at the breakfast or at the reception too weren t really customer friendly
