the check in procedure was very confusing it was busy at the hotel when i arrived and jaz s new age apple like approach to check in not just using the standard check in desk but also individuals who walk around with ipads seemed haphazard and confusing at best people were waiting everywhere it was not clear who was next in line and things did not move ahead with any speed after a hour flight a more straight forward check in procedure during which i didn t have to jostle for position would have been welcome the hotel was fine for the two nights i was there but i would opt to stay at the hampton by hilton next time as it s closer to the station and better value for money
