unfortunately there were a few things that made our stay a little less than perfect the breakfast wasn t up to the standard i expected the food that was served was very plain nothing spectacular whenever i went to get something to eat or drink i always had to look for what i needed the set up was a little bit chaotic that s when everything was filled up another point is the high parking rates we paid for days i think per day is a bit steep
