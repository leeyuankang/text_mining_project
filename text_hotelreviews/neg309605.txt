the hotelbird app and hotel system for rooms allocation are not synchronised we were given someone else s room during our stay i was worried that it would happen to our room and had to lock all the valuables in the safe our stay was spoiled by the cleaners as they did not bother to hoover our room in our last day all dirty cups were left and not replaced by the clean ones and fresh tea bags were not provided
