i think the hotel is overpriced for what it offers location is far from the center rooms are nice but anything exceptional it is only the big board with the girl face they put on top of the bed that makes the difference but it is the same in all the rooms i seemed to understand i was upset by the breakfast poor choice and low quality great breakfast room though i would come again but for a cheaper rate
