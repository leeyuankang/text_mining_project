we arrived by car and the entrance comes very sudden in a roundabout with not a particular good sign go straight in the roundabout it s then down a steep hill until you are at the entrance it doesn t realy look like a hotel entrance if you miss the exit it s quite a long way to drive back and get it right the parking attendent was also very rude and kept insisting about a reservasion while the reseptionist had told us that we should just tell him we were guests at the hotel
