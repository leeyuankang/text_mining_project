no hotel parking although the parking is in the hotel building it does not belong to the hotel and requires separate payment and my us credit cards did not work there causing a long delay upon departure so no advantage to the hotel location being away from the city with regards to parking we took the train to the city convenient if you are ok with a few minutes walk
