the breakfast it was a struggle to find a clean table as the staff was totally unattentive some of the facilities such as an ipad to control coffee brewing are a nice gadget but not very effective there are no quit e meeting rooms to be found which is essential for somebody on business trip the restaurant is chiefly for loud speaking because of the dj beer drinking guests the decoration of the corridor is really ugly but that is personal taste there is no real place in the room where to store your cloths never discovered how to keep water in the sink my room not only had no view but was facing a light blinking wall that was quite disturbing
