on check in the staff did not tell us about any of the facilities in the hotel such as the restaurant or the gym facilities usually this would not matter however on two seperate occasions during my our stay we asked different staff members if there was anywhere to eat to which we were literally pointed at the door and told there might be somewhere out there and another time were offered a takeaway menu which made no sense to us as on the third and final night of our stay we discovered there was a restaurant within the bar area of the hotel also even though the location to the metro was excellent the actual location of the hotel in general was not that good within itself there were next to no bars or restaurants to eat and drink at during the night making our time there a little underwhelming during the night time overall i would say that although i loved my time in amsterdam the hotel played no part in enhancing my stay and i definitely wouldn t recommend it to anyone that is visiting amsterdam for pleasure
