the only thing which was not good was the service in the restaurant i only had breakfast the choice of cold foods was good but the restaurant has no proper system for preparing hot food e g fried eggs bacon one morning i had to ask staff who were rushing around three times before i received my order on a second occasion i ordered but it never arrived and i gave up on the morning of leaving i needed an early breakfast and was assured that a number of items would be made available to me to eat in my room in fact all i was presented with was a few pieces of old bread a couple of pieces of fruit and a used bottle of orange juice this was very disappointing for a four star hotel
