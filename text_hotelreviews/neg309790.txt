we arrived in a rental car with a gps and couldn t find the hotel entrance due to the lack of signage in the area we circled around the hotel eventually finding the entrance only to be told that the hotel parking was full due to the evening performance at the nearby concert hall after explicit instructions which were wrong and after several more circular trips we eventually found the parking by this time we were hungry so headed to the hotel restaurant which unfortunately for us closes at after that you have the limited choice of bar food which is the alternative we chose or you need to leave the premises to find other restaurants
