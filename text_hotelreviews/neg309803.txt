the shower has a fancy design with integrated controller but it is absolutely useless we stayed at the hotel for two nights and our shower did not work properly at the last night it was totally out of service we were asked to change room and at the end we went and used shower at another room breakfast is really poor for a five star hotel i haven t seen such a breakfast not even a warm dish is served only cooked egg ham and bread and the worse is we had diarrhea both of us after eating the breakfast
