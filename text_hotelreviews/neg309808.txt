the service in the restaurant in the hotel was really bad it took very long to get anything we asked for minutes for a glass of water but i think they were a bit understaffed as the waiter also made drinks the beertails were awful it was like the bar was trying to be too alternative being a barman myself i can say you need a mixologist working there if you want to make the most of the cool bar you have everything else was perfect
