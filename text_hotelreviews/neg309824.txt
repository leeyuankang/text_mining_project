on booking your hotel i looked for the closest proximity to amsterdam centrum which it said was approximately miles on arrival i asked a staff member how far it was and she told me it was just under km way from the centrum this resulted in me having to pay a euro taxi fair each way of which we travelled four times costing a total of euros this was very misleading on your behalf and i was very upset with this part of my break as i did not set aside extra money for taxi fairs such as this please respond asap
