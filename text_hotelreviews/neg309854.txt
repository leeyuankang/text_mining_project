the only small thing that we ve noticed and that could improve is that the bar staff was very busy and couldn t cope with the demand they were great but needed some help on the night there was a group of girls a party in the restaurant area and the focus was on serving them but customers in the bar area were waiting for a very long time to be served including us mins wait for a beer and a juice there was few members of staff the restaurant who didn t have much to do at the time that could easily jump to the bar area and help out also the food wasn t the best the burger was overdone and dry and the chips were also bit burned no one checked if we were happy with food after we have finished shame as food is not cheap there
