it s unbelievable but they don t provide vanity sets and slippers i thought maybe they are available on request but no there are no shower caps or nail files at the hotel the guy who answered the phone sounded surprised finally said no we have nothing like that only shaving kit no room service available empty minibar only water in it really when i check in i just want my room key and no questions about where i am from and why i came check in was too long and way too personal staff at the restaurant is clueless took order from one person ignored the other food was good though
