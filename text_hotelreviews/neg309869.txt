housekeeping is probably the worst part of the hotel when i checked in my room floor was a mess with biscuit crumbles and teabags on the floor i instantly switched my room room was clean but housekeeping didn t clean my room the next day they had only made my bed and put my dirty towels that were on the floor onto my bed if they had folded those towels i could be tricked into thinking that they were new clean they didn t clean the bathroom sink or swipe the floor it s also very noisy at night loud music comes from outside it really doesn t matter which floor your room is or which side it is looking at
