parking do not drive at night not knowing the area and expect to find the parking it also makes no mention at all of the parking charge nowhere did i see instructions of how and where to park please make this clearer with clear instructions of how and where to park when you ve driven for three hours you really don t want to have to try and phone the hotel they don t answer the phone quickly either to find out where to go from someone who has a very strong accent and is very hard to understand
