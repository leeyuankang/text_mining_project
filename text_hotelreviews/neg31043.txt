i don t like the fact that i had to carry my meal in a tray all the way from the main restaurant to my room on the floor when we arrived on a hot day we wanted cold water as soon as we reached our room but there was no fridge or cold water to drink i think they should consider having a small fridge or put a cold water in the room just before their guest check in
