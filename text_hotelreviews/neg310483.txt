some of the staff are a cold and non friendly of course not all of them firstly when arriving behind the counter the receptionist didn t say welcome or anything he looks and says do your own checking in i proceed then i ask how do i pay cash to this machine he replies oh you can t i will need to do that so the whole processes was carried out again out of five nights and six days the room was serviced times one morning approximately with the door locked from inside a service person walked in whilst we are sleeping i found it very strange the lock doesn t stop their cards and when i approached another female staff telling her about the incident asking if they can do it the next day she replies with false claims for the event rude lady there were some minor issues a blue cushion had white stain on it for the entire stay and it was never cleaned or replaced there was too much lints in the air all the shelves had lints and dust gathering up one of our perfume left on the table was used up on daily bases to a finishing point really sad but true both staff specified here were non native dutch
