upon my arrival the check in system was a bit complicated and when i asked for help found the girl at the reception was kind of not happy to help just keep saying here is the machine and go and check in in another occasion when i went to have dinner at found the restaurant was closed already and when i complained they let me in but saying that the last order is at so i complained why you haven t mentioned this in your introduction paper in the restaurant i ordered a salmon salad and surprisingly was told pushed by alessandro the waiter that there is no dressing for this salad and because he likes everything with vinegar i should just use vinegar for salad dressing very annoying apart from a cold attitude of the girls at the reception and the restaurant issue all the rest were fantastic ah and this place is a dry hotel so no alcohol or wine being served so be aware
