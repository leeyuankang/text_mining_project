no availability of food or an alcoholic drink after after taking advantage of the long daylight hours and lovely weather we returned to the hotel mins by tram from the touristy dam square a few minutes after to be told that no meal was possible after not even a beer we were given the opportunity to order from a takeaway but that s hardly what we expected we did discover a friendly local place that put together a meal and drinks for us though their kitchen was closed the mini bar in our room was also not working my partner did enjoy the gym facility though during the self check in process i would have liked someone to be around to address a query i had there was an unnecessary delay at check in following a long trip into amsterdam
