the eco friendly bathroom if the timer for the sensor lights can be extended to run for maybe at least minutes before they switch off automatically it would be perfect not all rooms come with the eco friendly bathroom though only a few do the upside though is that this bathroom is more spacious compared to the one in another room we booked we booked the same type of room having said that the normal bathroom is still spacious p s this is only a minor flaw compared to all the other good points this hotel offers
