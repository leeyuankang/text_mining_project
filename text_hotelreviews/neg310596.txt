we didn t know and weren t informed that the hotel didn t have a liquor license and there was nowhere local available to avoid going into the city for food and drink albeit the hotel was wonderful and transport right outside close to other commercial buildings there was no other facilities just a small thing we all noted and we figured out the beds are very comfy but in no time you feel sweaty this we think is due to the protective hygiene under sheets and pillow slips that prevent moisture entering the bed a great idea but ready to shower in the morning
