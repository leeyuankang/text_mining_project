i have travelled around the world and i am not sure if this is the case with all hotels in amsterdam but the reception staff weren t the most welcoming bunch they didn t smile much at all i asked for a spoon to have dinner which i had bought from town centre because i couldn t find one in the room and the receptionist said we don t have any right now and the restaurant is closed hospitality can definitely be improved also the taxis that the hotel books on behalf of you are very expensive its a rip off i d say they even recommend it which i thought was very unprofessional because an uber costs half as much at times
