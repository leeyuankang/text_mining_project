this hotel was a little too far out from the city for us despite the tram stop being so close its built in a residential area not a very pretty location sorry we didn t like the area we also felt that the hotel lacked atmosphere and i feel that the lack of a bar no alcohol is served meant that there wasn t a buzz where people could gather and socialise we wouldn t stay here again
