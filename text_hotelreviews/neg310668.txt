front desk staff that checked us in was very rude when my husband asked her to change the room as it was facing the motorway and we could hear noise she was annoyed that i used the bathroom to wash my hands we did get a change of room that was quiet but a downgrade as she said that was all available the room was dirty and dusty there was chewing gum on the duvet strange gross marks all over the wall and dirty glasses in the room we dare not complain again when we checked out we got the same member of staff who looked at me with disdain and never asked how was the stay she just took the keys this was definitely not a comfort room or a star hotel horrible the breakfast was awful too very tasteless
