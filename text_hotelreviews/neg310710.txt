location isn t amazing the tram stop is very close just in front of the hotel however is takes a few good minutes to arrive to the city center the staff did not communicate with us at all we are used to be greeted when we enter or leave the hotel however the staff does not engage much our room wasn t cleaned for one day not sure why and this is ok but when we called the front desk and asked for clean towels we kind of expected the housekeeping team to bring also soaps and shampoo they brought only towels and when the room was cleaned on the following day the left the empty shampoo bottles in the shower room which is not that nice
