the mini bar just didn t work we were not given fresh towels at any point on our night stay the local restaurants were extremely poor standard mainly though loads of other guests were smoking cannabis right outside the main entrance to the hotel which meant the stench was lingering inside the hotel at reception etc very nasty first impression i understand the coffee shops are a huge part of tourism in amsterdam but as far as i m aware it isn t legal to smoke cannabis in public and i was especially astonished that none of the staff at the hotel seemed bothered by the fact they reception area stunk of it
