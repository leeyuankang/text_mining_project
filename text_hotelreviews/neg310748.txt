i specific request a double bed in the room months in advance because of course we are a couple and when we arrived they say that was based on availability and they told me that was possible to change from the next day before o clock what was strange is that the day after we woke up very late so we asked to change for the next day and they told me yes it is possible just we had to show up in the reception before so that s mean that they have rooms dbl bed available everyday but they just don t care about the request but they just try anyway to give you a separate bed room that s a shame i think for a stars hotel
