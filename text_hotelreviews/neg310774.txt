more expensive than i would normally like but that s my fault for booking a holiday last minute there was also very minimal staff interaction especially as you check in out using a touchscreen system and there aren t that many staff around also you have to pay on card which was a pain seeing as we d converted extra cash to pay for the room being said the staff we did interact with were very nice
