unfortunately this hotel doesn t serve alcohol being a young couple of brits this shocked us and was a bit of a deal breaker really but other than that facilities were good apart from the fact our coffee machine in the room didn t work which wasn t a huge issue as neither of us are really big coffee drinkers and i m sure if we requested it to be replaced it would have been as the staff were very helpful
