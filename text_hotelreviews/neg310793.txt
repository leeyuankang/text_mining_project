being asked to pay for my total stay before i stayed at reception at check in i asked why to be told that the check out queue is usually very high so it is hotel policy to charge on arrival i came down at noon to check out to see this huge queue and was welcomed to a cold empty reception hall with no guests being chased around the breakfast hall by a waitress waving a bill for me to sign for the euro breakfast i gave my name and room number at arrival breakfast was offered at if you book on the day of arrival a sore punishment for not knowing concrete plans on arrival the cleanliness of the room was very poor the bathroom was not made up after me asking for it to be via the button on the wall my tea cup was simply rinsed in the bathroom with water and placed back into a dirty saucer that was forgotten i got into bed to find a mist of dust lurking all around me thanks to the light above the bed showing up all the dust it made me feel uneasy to sleep that night knowing i was breathing it all in the design of the room is really nice however was let down by the carpets not being hoovered bedding not changed bed simply made not changed and wash area s left dirty with water marks still left on the mirror from the morning before what is room cleaning petty policies from the hotel made me feel unwelcome as a guest and treated like a criminal for booking to stay at this not so cheap hotel i could have chose a chosen hotel to town for a fraction of the price here but i wanted a nice hotel where i could get some peace having given my credit card on arrival i did not expect to be treated like this and also did not see any other guests paying in advance for their stay on arrival
