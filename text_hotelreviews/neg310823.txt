when i ordered a taxi from reception they didn t order someone trusted so the taxi driver thought i was a tourist i used to live there and took minutes to get to my destination which was from my hotel if one asks a hotel to book transport one expects a reliable driver i would have got there quicker by bus the staff were so professional they came across and unfriendly no warm welcome or chat just wanted their money and to dispense a ket upon arrival even though i was the only one checking in and there wasn t a queue breakfast was overpriced the coffee machine in my room didnt work half the time and the mini bar had no alcohol i won t stay again
