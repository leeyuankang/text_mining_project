the reception area and some reception staff are not very welcoming in our experience the room was nice but the television scrambled repeatedly and the maintenance guy said it was not something they could do anything about as it was a signal problem really frustrating trying to watch a programme that keeps cutting out every minute or so literally on two nights the nespresso machine was pretty useless especially if you wanted tea although not a problem for us the hotel does not have alcohol available which is strange for a large chain hotel and a restaurant
