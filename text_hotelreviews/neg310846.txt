location was slightly out from the heart of amsterdam but i suppose the price is reflected in this and the tram that runs from right outside the hotel is fantastic just make sure you don t overdo the nightlife and stay out too late as taxi prices are a rip off tbh also not sure why there is no bar in the hotel seeing as it is a little bit out of the way and a couple of quiet drinks would have been nice before heading out in the eveining
