location is kind of ok close to hoofddorpplein to tram stop but tram to the city centre takes if you go to city centre twice a day that s too much sitting in a tram no fridge in the room unlike what we though while booking room was tidy but not super clean bike renting was too expensive should be less for hotel guests or even free like in many hotels at amsterdam staff was ok but not really friendly typical dutch there is a restaurant in the hotel but we didn t really know whether it was open or not altogether nice new hotel but i would expect more value for the money
