we did request a double room but got a twin we did not bring this up to the staff as we checked in late and were very tired the beds are very hard but you can t please everyone i would suggest that anyone coming studies the public transport links from the airport as the taxis rip you off you can get to this hotel for euros by train but a taxi will charge euros
