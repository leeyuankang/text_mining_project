the place is a bit too far if you don t take the train to commute although there are some ways to reach schiphol airport and central station directly bus from schiphol goes to somewhere in the city i forgot the place s name and then take tram and it will be directly parked across from the hotel easy access to tram and there is also a metro station nearby but a bit far away from the city center
