nothing the staff were fantastic there was nothing to complain about transportation back to the hotel after midnight is only possible via taxi or using the nightbus this is not too bad as taxis are readily available the nightbus schedule is posted at every tramstop this is not really a negative against the hotel as they cannot help it
