could be more hospitable for long stay guests we had rooms for one week and never saw or heard from any guest relations officer no amenities or gesture to thank us staff are all pleasant but do not connect with their guests seems almost mechanically efficient way of doing business i booked through booking com as i am aware of the value of booking through booking com and was surprised that there is barely any acknowledgement for a long stay guest perhaps a b b would have given a family more personalised treatment so will certainly choose something else next time bed linen was excellent however towels are definitely in need of replacement very thread bare and lacking in comfort and size
