we asked for a room in the morning because we had an early morning flight the staff said that there s no room and we should wait that s fair since there s a standard check in time we sat at the lobby when we saw two families arrive and check in successfully it surprised me so i went to ask the staff for a room pointing out that the families checked in before us only after that we immediately were offered a room it was a bit strange to be honest
