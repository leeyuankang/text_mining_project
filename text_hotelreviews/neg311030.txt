i called the receptionist for slippers after checking into the room and the initial response i got after waiting and calling back was that they are running out of stock and there was break down of delivery service so won t be able to get anything within the next few days i expressed that this sounds ridiculous as an international hotel chain then the receptionist said she would try again and the slippers were delivered afterwards btw the food quality was poor as a hotel breakfast and that coupled with the service didn t pump me up for a start of the day
