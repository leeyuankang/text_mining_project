the staff was very unfriendly and we were not made to feel welcome check in and check out is from a computer while this is convenient it s not the same thing as being greeted and made to feel welcome whenever we needed to ask a question about anything during our stay the staff was almost rude and not friendly at all we are planning a return to amsterdam and i doubt we would stay at this hotel again due to the staff
