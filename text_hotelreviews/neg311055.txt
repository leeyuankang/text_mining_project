i wish they had more amenities like an indoor pool or sauna or even a play area for kids i know the hotel is more for businesses but it would be nice to have for when people travel with young kids i was also aware about them having a problem with the alcohol license therefor they couldn t serve it i wasn t a big deal but would ve been nice to unwind with a glass of wine to end the busy day we had but at the same time it s nice because they weren t any irresponsible drunks around the lobby
