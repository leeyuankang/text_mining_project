more impressed that one is the alarm given in the am over mins the noise woke us up including under years child and announced us needed to leave the building my child cried and scared however the next day no staff explained or apologized another thing is not replenished facial tissues not toilet roll and cleaned wine glasses in the next three nights actually it is not a good experience to stay in the best western premier hotel
