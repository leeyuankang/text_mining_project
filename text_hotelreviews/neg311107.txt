i had booked the accommodation months in advance and has requested a double room when i checked in i was given the twin room because the hotel was completely full i questioned reception about why i was not able to obtain my choice of room considering the date i booked the room i had evidence from an email they were speechless and fumbling for words no answers i did not take the breakfast why would you pay such a cost when you can get delicious pastries closer into town
