no bathrobes which were meant to be there but wasn t an issue as the room was clean modern comfortable and had great facilities location wasn t amazing as it was outside city centre but the tram stopped right outside hotel and went to city centre in about plus we got to see a lot of the city via the team which was nice no bar but we weren t that bothered might put some off
