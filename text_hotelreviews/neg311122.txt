the women at the desk was very rude she told us that there are no double rooms available and gave us a twin bed after we went upstairs and checked the room we saw many tiny black and brown hair on the bed and cushion i went to the reception and talked to another male hotel staff and he immediately gave me a double room the gesture was nice but the bed also had tiny hair on it
