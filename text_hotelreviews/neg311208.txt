front desk staff not nice i dreaded going to the front desk seemed like we were annoying them and did not smile or show any warmth i was there for holidays in a good mood and that really made me never want to stay there again especially a blonde tall lady housekeeping cleaned our room days we were there many times we left in the am and came back by or and the room had not been done it was also quite far from anything in an area filled with office buildings we spent new year s eve at the hotel restaurant which is the same cafeteria that they use for the breakfast they did not sell alcohol the waiter was overwhelmed and after an hour after we d placed our order he came to tell us that they were out of what we had ordered the waiter was really nice so no big deal however that coupled with the mean front desk staff and the lack of daily room cleaning it was not such a pleasurable experience overall
