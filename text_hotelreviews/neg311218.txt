the staff were not very accommodating kitchen and checking out i am allergic to specific things and was unable to eat breakfast there and they wouldn t cook anything else so we want out instead which was fine but they didn t attempt to accommodate even when the place was quiet we also noticed that the cleaner hadn t done a proper job and left plastic bags on the floor and didn t clean properly before checking out we wanted to keep the room for an extra hour as we weren t leaving for our flight until but the staff didn t even attempt to check to see if that was possible it was just a flat out no with no apology we love amsterdam and had a lovely time but next time we won t book here i advise you to book in dam square or somewhere closer
