the hotel advertises that they have an airport shuttle leaving every minutes however the morning i checked out they informed me you have to book it in advance how are the guests supposed to know this if it is advertised differently it took me then instead of minutes almost hours to get to the airport with public transport secondly no one is there to assist when you check in and their automatic check in system doesn t work the bar doesn t sell alcohol and the rooms do not look like it does on the booking com website
