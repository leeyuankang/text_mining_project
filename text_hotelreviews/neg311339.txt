check in it was a bit of an unpleasant surprise to find out that we needed to check in with help of self service check in machine kind of like many airports have now but if in airport it s a bit tolerable in the hotel it sure feels like an impersonal service so it s a minus in our book in addition noone checks the passport we wondered really about security for basically it could be anyone who checked in hotel is situated in a quiet area which is a plus but it s a bit boring area and quite out of city center it takes around minutes to come to center by tram sleeping quality the bed is probably a dream to those who enjoy sleeping on very hard madrasses for those who like softer beds it s a nightmare one of the worst beds i ve experienced in a hotel it felt like sleping on stones and the pillow was definitely the worst it was very hard and high for me just not possible to sleep on so i slept on my sweater instead it was a big dissapointment next day i found a bit better pillow which was well hidden i must say we adressed reception about the madrass and they replaced it with a softer one which unfortunately was close same hard as the previous one aircondition is also harsh for our taste it blows too much even when the ventilation is off i came home with back and neck pain and a soar throat it s a pity because hotel is really nice but comfort is not completely up to our taste
