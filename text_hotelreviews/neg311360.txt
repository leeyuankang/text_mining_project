we were told booking breakfast a day in advance offers a discount and so we paid for breakfast on arrival our name was not on the breakfast list and we were charged on leaving staff were not very friendly either we avoided interaction with them restaurant open hours were really inconvenient we ended up having food delivered we were so hungry and there s not much around the restaurant as it s a residential area it is at least ten stops on the tram as well
