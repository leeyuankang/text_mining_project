the carpet floor was probably cleaned before our stay and our bedroom smelled a bit like a damp the smell was quite strong when we arrived but it did go away after a day or two we spent three nights over there the tv in our children s bedroom didn t work but as we hardly spent time in the hotel we didn t complain about it
