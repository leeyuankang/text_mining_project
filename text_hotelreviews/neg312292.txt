we had issues with the ac fan not working on our first night and had to be switched to another room the next day the air as warm and stale all night it was very uncomfortable we had just arrived after hours of flying i couldn t get comdortable and the pillows were overstuffed and firm i was struggling and regretting my euro a night stay at that point the staff upgraded our room the next two nights for free which was a nice gesture the next room had a heavy glass shower door that kept coming off the tracks which was scary as well as anexpresso maker that had functionality issues the ceiling in both room were extremely thin and we had very noisy guests above us the second and third nights of or stay one guest was much of the night walking in heels and dropping things on the floor right over our bed and the other guest was up incredibly early to check out i was kept awake through it all i slept poorly all nights of my stay which is really my only negative remark an upscale hotel should be a sanctuary to rest and refresh that certainly didn t happen during my stay
