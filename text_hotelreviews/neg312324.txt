lack or organisation from staff and some who need training especially for a hotel which i believe is overrated for what you get for the price breakfast is a mess and confusing with an abundance of chocolate and lack of choice to what breakfast should be very strange and very very expensive for what you get service generally very slow and staff forgetful of orders for small glasses of orange juice for breakfast the hotel needs to make many changes to hold its status i wouldn t go back however the cleanliness is outstanding and some staff are really nice need to turn down the air fresheners in the hotel as its so overpowering it makes you want to run to your room to escape the potent stench
