there were a couple of small niggles all nit picking but things i expect to be sorted in a hotel of this calibre the toilet roll holder was remarkably low which meant i kept pulling it from the wall it was unusable for a man standing there was some damage to the paintwork on the wardrobe door one of the drawers in the desk didn t open properly my husband fixed this there was a soft closer on the inner toilet lid but not on the outer one
