kitchen staff were rude especially the middle aged lady wearing black who seemed to be in charge flies were landing on the fresh meats and cheeses so we alerted the staff but instead of throwing away the food and replacing with fresh food or even just trying to get rid of the fly they looked annoyed that we d said anything and said in german not realising we understood that they d just leave it there for tomorrow s guests this is disgusting as who knows what else that fly has been contaminated with also we requested a hard boiled egg when we were the only two guests in the breakfast room there were several staff members and still it took them minutes to make it
