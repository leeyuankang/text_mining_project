the only thing which is not so convenient is parking on booking is written that hotel is providing parking to guests but actually it is public garage which is not so close takes you min walking distance and if you have to carry luggage it is not so easy also it is not possible to approach hotel entrance by car as it is pedestrian area so guests should be informed before arrival for safe side and not to lose too much time on searching the hotel also room was a little cold and staff couldn t help with that unfortunately but i guess it is because of season end of march still these are just small recommendations but we would anyhow return back as it is very nice hotel
