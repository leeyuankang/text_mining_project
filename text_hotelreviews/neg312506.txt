didn t like the fact that there is no roof terrace the pictures you see of the pool etc make it appear that they are on the roof however this is all actually on the floor and stops serving at and closes at the bar on the floor has a roller shutter roof and cannot really be described as a roof terrace either ps there are no tea or coffee making facilities in the room at all
