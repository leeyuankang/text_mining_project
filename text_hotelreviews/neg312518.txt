a number of things didn t meet expectations when i arrived i was persuaded to upgrade to a superior room with so called lots of extras however the only advantage i could see that we were given a room on a higher level which wasn t needed we asked on the first day if we could change our bathrobes because they were too small they were taken out of the room and never replaced so we couldn t go and use the swimming pool we asked twice for the replacements we asked the front desk to advise us of the nearest pick up point for the city tour bus after arriving at the pick up point which was a ten minute walk away were told by the bus agent that we had booked with another bus company and they didn t pick up from this point so we had to pay euros for a taxi to take us to a correct pick up point
