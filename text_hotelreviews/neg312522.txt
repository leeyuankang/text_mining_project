the room looked a little tired in comparison to the photos on the website although there was a kettle in the room there was no tea or coffee provided the shower is lovely and spacious however it is not very powerful and the temperature is temperamental i d suggest getting a taxi to and from the airport as this is approx half the cost of the hotel service
