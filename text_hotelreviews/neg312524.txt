prices are high but not unexpected due to the high quality of the hotel as mentioned in other reviews there was a kettle for the ramen pot noodles but no tea or coffee facilities i was also charged for the minibar but hadn t used anything from it we had used it to store water we had bought rather than pay for the hotels maybe this is why they thought it had been used something to watch out for as mentioned before the shower leaks a lot but as long as you put foot towels down it s not a big problem we left them in the bath each morning for the maid to change for dry ones
