cleaning is extremely poor dust everywhere finger spots on the furniture dirty spots in the bathroom i have asked the cleaning lady to tidy up the room properly but it did not help much very slow elevator requires a lot of waiting shower was leaking water wifi could also be better air conditioning was noisy my room was facing the street and was also noisy the cleaning personnel is on some kind of strike against electricity saving every time we returned to the hotel all the lights were on in the room and air conditioning was on with an open window location is far from the centre you need to walk min to the tram station then take several stops to the main tourist area it is absolutely not a star hotel i always trust booking com and reviews published there i travel a lot and have not been deceived yet but this time i had an impression that all good ratings and reviews for this hotel were a fake
