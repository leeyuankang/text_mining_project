i had the worst experience when i first got in the hotel not only i took a long flight and was tired and wanted to check in early but the staff at the reception was very rude i understand that check in is strictly at but there s no need to be rude about it i arrived at and asked him if i could check in early and he said no he didn t even make eye contact i waited until literally and he said very rudely and loudly five more minutes i got so nervous that my phone fell on the floor second issue was the toilet it was clean but i noticed hairs in the bathtub and towel placed on sink i cleaned it myself as i was extremely exahusted to change rooms or to even walk downstairs to tell them about it i just passed out right after third issue was the restaurant i tried their pasta on my last day and it made sick on the way to the airport that i actually threw up it tasted weird but i thought i d eat it anyway ps i don t know what was the guy s name but he was the worst other staff were nicer and one of them apologized to me for his behavior one person gave a bad look to the rest of the staff i m extremely dissatisfied with my experience it was just horrible
