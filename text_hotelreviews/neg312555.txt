firstly i have no idea how this hotel can rate as stars perhaps it is the expensive hatted restaurant attached that gives it its status when we arrived there was no porter to help with our luggage we stayed for nights in this hotel we had clean towels etc however our linen was not changed the whole time the bathroom has mould around the tiles and whan we complained that the bar fridge was not cold we were told that it was a closet not a fridge my friend and i have travelled regularly all around the world staying in star hotels and neither of us have ever heard that a fridge is a closet there is also the issue of room service to order anything to your room including ice attracts a euro charge which is ludicrious and just plain greedy all in all i would love to stay in the area again if i come back to amsterdam but not at this hotel
