we stayed for eight days and nights and i were terribly disappointed that they had no bureau in the room to enable my wife and me to unpack our clothes i would not be able to recommend your hotel for an extended stay beyond a night or two we had to live out of our suitcases that was extremely uncomfortable added to that the elevator was constantly out of service that i can understand for a day or two but beyond that the lack of shelves in the room was not understandable we loved your city of amsterdam and do plan to return but unfortunately not to your hotel when we travel to a lovely city like this we always come for more than one or two nights
