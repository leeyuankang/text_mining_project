the bar area was inviting but could have used more staff our bartender seemed overworked trying to tend to the needs of his own customers and those of the restaurant and had to leave the bar to serve drinks in the restaurant the bar was well appointed but could use a special cocktail menu to bring it to the level of the food served in the restaurant
