just some minor things that however did affect our experience even though our stay was fully pre paid the reception has frozen a sum on top of what was paid in case of any damage also one day we came back to the room and it wasn t cleaned even though we ve put a sign on the door another day the cleaning lady has thrown away my shower cap but didn t replace it with a new one so i had to call reception in the night coffee and tea was also not renewed every day
