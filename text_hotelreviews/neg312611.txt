first room we were given was dirty with crumbles on the side table and dirty dock in the corner of the room the room smelled of cannabis and was freezing when we asked about the heating the maid didn t know how to make it work at the end we were asked to wait after waiting for ages and a few phone calls to reception we were given another room with again not working heater then we just gave up and asked to bring us electric heater instead the heating system in this hotel is terrible and only goes up to degrees so if you like to be warm you don t get that in bilderberg hotel
