that your not told before arriving that you have to pay each night security deposit just incase you use mini bar ect we should be made aware of this to bring the extra money also the hotel is in a very quiet location me and my partner would of preferred somewhere not so quiet ands fair away from the centre but easy enough to catch the tram going to the centre
