even though i chose and booked this hotel the for private parking at the time of booking i prebooked a parking space anf when i arrived they told me to park the car on the street as they don t have parking spaces available the rooms not even close to a star hotel and also very cold as the a c cannot be adjusted higher than so it was a really bad experience
