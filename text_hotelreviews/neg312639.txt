it was very cold in the room when we arrived we informed the reception and they send someone to check that person told us it would be warm soon the next morning it was still cold the reception promised us we could change rooms in the afternoon but when we arrived back in the hotel there was no other room available and it was still cold in the room they gave us a heater i don t understand why they didn t give it the first day the whole floor had a problem with heating but they didn t inform the client on top of this they charged my credit card twice this is more a star than a star hotel the rooms are outdated there is no gym no swimming pool and service is not high standard the weekend was a birthday present for my husband and i am disappointed i ve stayed here several times but i will not return
