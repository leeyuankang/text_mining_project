room service not too good asked for ice and it never turned up also if you are on service side of building the staff make a hell of a din when finishing their shifts shame the hotel used to have real flowers plants and apples no more why the hell not it s holland for god s sake and you get plastic plants in the lift lobbies looks cheap as i have been to this hotel many times before and i get the feeling it is cost cutting
