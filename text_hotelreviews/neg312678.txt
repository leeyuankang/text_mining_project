it is a bit strange that it was the first time i am experiencing this that staff and stewardesses were keep knocking the door a day and asking if i need anything or want the room to be cleaned well i know they were trying to be nice but it s disturbing that they keep knocking your door and asking when you don t expect anyone to be at the door oh god i need to be left alone in peace and if i need anything i would ask you can clean my room when i am out that s the only thing that i didn t like
