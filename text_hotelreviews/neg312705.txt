we ve got blinded by the stars this was definitely not what we expected the hotel seems outdated at least from the outside and we ve much rather stayed in the city center we ve called the room service and asked for some silverware and they wanted to charge euros to bring a fork from the kitchen to the room they offered water from plastic cups in the lobby and the water cooler was empty for our entire stay this is a good metaphor for our stay at this hotel it seems to be more of a star conference hotel definitely not stars
