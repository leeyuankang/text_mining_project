this is definitely not a star hotel even not in the past see further airco is very loud and if you switch off at night it s extremely hot covers to hot elevator had problem in the way that you need to call it several times before it comes sofa and chairs are so smelly that you can t sit on it nor hang clothing on it otherwise you can t go out with them breakfast is way to expensive for the provided quality fitness and swimming pool is available at the other site of the hotel for per person per day crazy for a star half of the lights broke down in the room around and we had to wait for the technician the day after around lunch time a whole night without lights except bathroom again not really star quality
