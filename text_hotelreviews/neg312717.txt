my worst hotel experience ever no hot water on one of the mornings of our stay when we asked about it got a promise that it will be fixed in minutes till our check out hours later still no hot water besides the hot water issue the water flow was very weak the shower tap did not stay in fixed position had to hold it with h nd if you wanted to wash yourself wouln t expect it from a hotel but amsterdam itself is wonderful
