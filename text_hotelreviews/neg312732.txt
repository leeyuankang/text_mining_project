long wait to get into room told it would be ready at but it wasn t while other people who were clearly more affluent than us were getting straight to the room and definitely received a better customer service then on saturday night a card was put under the door asking me to pay for mini bar items a bottle of water pringles when i had given deposit on my card when i checked in and we were checking out the next day got the impression they didn t trust us they took the money out of my account the day after i booked which i didn t think this would happen as i booked through this site rooms dated and air con doesn t work well
