the room was clean but tired carpets not clean there was not a single shelf in the room are you supposed to live out of your suitcase the bathroom can t possibly be rated small and far from luxurious sink was blocked and the staff could t help us the internet was very slow even the kettle didn t work the room service menu was limited to only four options there was no electrical plug next to the bathroom and no lights next to the plug so doing my hair was a bit of a challenge there were only three pillows in the room for two people stuff walk into the room without knocking hallways were dirty and on and on will not recommend this hotel to those accustomed to five star quality
