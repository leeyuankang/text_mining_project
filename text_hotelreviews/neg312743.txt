this hotel does not deserve a star rating the interior of the rooms is outdated that includes the bathroom the airconditioning did not work so the room felt hot and stuffy after complaining about it the hotel admitted to a general problem so switching rooms was not a solution i had booked for two nights and had prepaid unfortunately so i could only try to grin and bear it will never return though
