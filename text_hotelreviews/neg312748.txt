we got charged extra money when we arrived we had to pay for every night we stayed extra eur because of security purposes of course we got the money back after checking out but it was a really unpleasant experience and it gets worse at the check out they charged us for city tax and service charge can you imagine that the hotel itself was super expensive and then they dont include in the price service charge seriously i can lift the towels myself up i dont need anyone to do that for me if i have to pay extra money another disappointing thing was the staff they seemed to be very judgmental because we were the only young couple in the hotel the rest were businessmen or old people they didnt really felt like greeting us and if they did then it was in a kinda funny way the mini bar had an old wine bottle with mold in it
