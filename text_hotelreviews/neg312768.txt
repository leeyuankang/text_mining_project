the walls are thin like paper each morning i could very clearly hear a couple in the next room having sex breakfast was not included nor was it made clear to me that this was the case nor was the breakfast worth euros per person per day as the breakfast never had bacon and was extremely poor i could have obtained a much better meal from a restaurant for less money but kept taking breakfast simply because i believed it was included and for included it was good enough but it was not worth paying for
