to be charged euros for breakfast which was very poor to say the least i m referring to the cooked breakfast the selection was always sparce the staff had to be asked to replenish the bacon egg etc and when they did they produced about rashers of bacon in my opinion the breakfast was very very poor especially for a very very high price the other gripe i have is regarding the lack of coffee tea etc in my room i presume the coffee milk etc was coming out of the maids wages as she failed to replenish those items will i return to amsterdam yes but i won t be staying at this hotel
