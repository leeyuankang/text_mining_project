i had a problem with the staff when i arrived i explained that i had bookings one for nights paid for by an organization and then i had my night booking paid for by me and i would be grateful if they could give me a room to be covered for the whole stay they advised that was not going to be a problem and gave me a folder for the key to a room for the whole period of nights however on sunday morning when i was having breakfast a receptionist approaches me and advises that i have to leave the room as the third night paid by me is a different type of room smaller and less expensive i find this unbelievable first to interrupt the client having breakfast and secondly of course the problem which i had signaled at arrival i would happily have stayed at the less expensive alternative for the whole stay in order not to have changed room it is unbelievable that reception personnel can make these types of errors at a hotel with supposedly a high standard
