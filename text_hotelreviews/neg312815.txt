the hotel is tired and dated has no character rooms were more travellodge than it certainly does not justify based on facilities or comfort bed was very hard a c unit outside window on flat roof was noisy and i should have been informed that there would be renovation works being carried out in common areas during my stay as well as a large and potentially noisy party at the hotel for the night but we checked out a day early early to avoid it this was hugely inconvenient and really ruined our stay in amsterdam i am not happy
