while this hotel tries very hard to have a cool modern minimalist look what might look nice in photos does not translate to a very good experience in the room i m afraid the biggest let down was the almost complete lack of soundproofing between the room and common areas atrium i could hear the lobby muzak the conversations of people waiting for the elevator and the screaming of the kids using the pool six floors up through my closed door not good additionally voices and footsteps from neighbouring units were very audible as i am a light sleeper i had to use ear plugs during the night also the use of semi transparent glass walls and doors between the bathroom and toilet section in the middle of the room and the kitchen and sleeping areas is of questionable taste i think the bathroom cubicle itself was supposed to have closing glass doors but the panels didnt want to move on their sliders anymore small niggles there was no place to hang your towels to dry after showering the tv remote only worked with the small screen in the kitchen the rooftop terrace could have been very nice if they luxed it up a bit with a bar and someone in attendance but as it was when i was there it was in effect a kindergarden full of screaming kids who in essence occupied the whole area a bit of attention from the staff would make it possible for other guests to enjoy the facilities too in all i was expecting something a bit more luxurious than what was provided and in particular the feeling of a lack of privacy lets this hotel down in my opinion
