no ac although promised in the website s description ac did not work we needed to switch rooms twice staff never apologized and was unfriendly out of nights we did not sleep nights since ac was not working and room was hot and humid as sauna it s july in spain hotel manager refused to compensate us despite this problem also very weird design of bathroom toilet without a door and in the middle of the room glass screen was translucent so no privacy in the bathroom quite awkward in addition kid s bed is a pullout armchair that was extremely uncomfortable kids woke up with back pain every morning overall if ac was working this is a fair deal since ac was not working very poor value for the money
