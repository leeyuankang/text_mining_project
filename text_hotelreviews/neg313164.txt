i made a reservation for a suite for people because we wanted a big room even though we were just adults and a baby but the hotel didn t agree with our needs and gave us a suite for adults as they thought was enough that s what the clerk at the front desk said what they didn t do is change the price accordingly thanks to booking s staff the price was reduced by euro such an audacity and fraud i ve never seen in my life
