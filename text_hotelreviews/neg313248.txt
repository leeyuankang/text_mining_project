the breakfast was not good but there was a cheaper better place just next door the bed was surprisingly uncomfortable no mattress cover so you feel every bump on the mattress i have the name of the mattress manufacturer permanently engraved on my butt we had to kick the door to get it open if you would like to know what the people in the next room thought about their vacation no problem the walls are paper thin the a c was sometimes cold sometimes not always musty the wifi was a disaster spotty and slow i had to go downstairs to the office and plug in ethernet just to load a webpage the staff was great they tried everything to help
