i specifically asked for a hotel with airconditoning and unfortunately the weather was hot during the afternoon and some evenings and when i requested the use of the a c they said that it wasn t possible and it would take a technician a week to have it turned on this was a very strange answer and not acceptable in fact if it wasnt for the fact that we had paid for the whole vacation i was seriously considering moving the hotel in front of your hotel because they had a room with a terrace and their a c was working
