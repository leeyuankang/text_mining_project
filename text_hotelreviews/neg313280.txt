we stayed three to a room as they had an option to add a bed to the room and it was much cheaper than anything else in barcelona for two rooms this was a mistake saving the money was good but i had a horrible time i was on the roll away bed which they had stuck next to the window which took up the whole wall who the heck wants to sleep against a wall of windows on a incredibly busy street with the cold right against you also i was on the fourth floor and i really do not like heights could have been higher but still it was horrible they should only offer that option in rooms without a floor to ceiling window terrifying furthermore paneling was coming off the molding was gone in many places furniture was broken and splintering bath tub looked like it had permanent stains on it they advertise that they have air conditioning but apparently not in winter we tried to turn the fan on to sleep as it was incredibly noisy only to find out that our only option was fan and heat or no fan at all no where to even change the temperature just had a switch for the fan we weren t expecting the best as we knew it would be a tight fit but the room was in terrible shape not worth saving the money
