the basement parking is tight for bigger cars we maneuvered our seater in and out of it with difficulty lifts are small and slow this means more time and effort for luggage if you are in a group and like some others have said the food was not hot which leaves not a pleasant feeling on a winter morning the hotel should consider using heating lamps or hot water trays on the counter to keep the food warm and delicious
