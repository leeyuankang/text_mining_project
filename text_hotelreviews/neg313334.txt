both mornings when coming to the breakfast food was basically gone took a long time before the staff refilled also the coffee machine was broken and all available tables were covered with dishes felt like they were understaffed also it was terribly hot in the room when asking about the air condition we were told that there was only heating at the moment april and that the ac was only used in july and august being a star hotel this is not acceptable with degrees outside in april you must be able to get cool air wonder how it will feel in june or september then we kept the window open for a while before going to bed but couldn t have it open all night due to the noise from the street
