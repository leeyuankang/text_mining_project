not so great but still acceptable breakfast was basic limited variety not great tasting but edible pastries bread juices sausages and eggs some of party felt the meat was a little under cooked and the powdered eggs weren t a big hit refills were available but slow hotel was busy during our stay but staff did their best which is what matters the key safe but that s a personal preference lighting in room lobby by full mirror a little dull for us ladies but the bathroom mirror was well lit sound proofing ok couldn t hear outside but might hear loud tv if your really bothered quiet we came to enjoy the city rooms were clean but looked a little worn in some rooms but still good to stay in especially for cost
