that vacation was very special for us because of my pregnancy and before our arrival we booked for a king size bed and send a comment through booking com please do not combine two seperate beds to make a queen bed but they had done just exactly the opposite after that we called the reception to change the room the did not follow up their answer was no personel also needs to learn english they can not understand you when you ask something room was not clean housekeeping service did not clean the dust on the floor and somedays they forgot to refresh the towels
