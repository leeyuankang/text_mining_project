it was a bad bad experience this was my and my husbands first trip together when i booked it was an option about choosing single beds or double bed i chose doublebed of course at the areival in the room it was singlebeds in the room which they had made into a doublebed when we asked about this in the reception they denied to do anything avout it maybe the reason also was that i had prepaid i slept on this doublebed for days and it was bad and terrible sleeping the staff had this rude and arrogant behaviour about this bed and simply denied to help us at all so dont trust this hotel
