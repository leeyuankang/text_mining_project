all staff members were really nice and professional except for the receptionist on my checkout day i had a disappointing incident when i received an abrupt phone call from the receptionist around telling me that i had to pay a half day charge for the room since i didn t checkout at noon time and that he called me before noon allegating that i answered him with a confirmation telling that the call was recorded of course this alarm call wasn t received at all as i asked for the manager to come to resolve the issue this is when the receptionist agreed to let me leave without the extra charge but after giving me really hard time especially when he asked for the safe keys to be brought down after finishing up my speedy packing in less than minutes i had to run to the room to hand them over
