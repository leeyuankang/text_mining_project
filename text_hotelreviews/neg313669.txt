the only negative thing i have to say about this hotel in the size of the beds i had a room with twin beds cause my co worker and i were sharing the room i am a bit of a chubby man so a twin bed is not a good thing for me and my worker is a tall guy therefore not a good thing for him either and the bed was really not comfortable that is the only negative thing i have to say about this place
