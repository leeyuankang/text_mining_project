there was a blockage in sink at bathroom it was filled with water when we called the receptionist he told us that he cant do anything and cant change the room because all the rooms are full and we have to wait until morning he just adviced us not to use sink what a great idea so we didnt use sink during night and next morning also they didnt put slipper in room when we requested for it he told us that there isnt room service at night shift so we had to wait until next day for slipper too bed scarfs were dirty covered with hair all in all it was an awful experience for us
