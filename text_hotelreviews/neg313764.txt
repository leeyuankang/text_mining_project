the only one problem with this hotel was one of the front desk staff sara every other staff member in this hotel was extremely friendly and helpful but sara was always slightly irritated and seemed rushed and frazzled she gave us inaccurate information which caused us to waste several hours another time we asked her a question she told us to come back in a few hours because she was busy unfortunately she was at the front desk a lot and we quickly learned to just avoid her if possible
