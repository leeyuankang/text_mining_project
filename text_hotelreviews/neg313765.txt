it should have been dusted better toilet door was almost transparent and could not be locked the quilts of the single beds had no full bed cover the price for the breakfast was extremely high for a family and not affordable the lights are not bright enough the staff could have been more welcoming with a genuine smile rather than just doing their duty but they were helpful with directions the photos of the room do not match the ones when i booked the hotel there seems to be a mix up of pictures between this hotel and the petit palace barcelona hotel not professional and misleading for the customer
