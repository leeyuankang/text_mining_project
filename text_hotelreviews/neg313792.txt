the rooms while well decorated weren t big enough for a couple like we were in a single room but they out a double bed in it don t bother booking the romantic package a welcome package and a special bed was specified my girlfriend was arriving before me so i made sure i got that so there would be some cava and chocolates waiting for her what actually happened was they asked her to wait while they prepared the room then forgot about her for a couple of hours while she watched other people checking in then no cava or chocolates in the room when i got there and asked about this the staff said they forgot and would do it the next day and acted like i was being difficult and tbh it was the cheapest cava we could find in the supermarket i believe the bed was standard as well it s little things like this that can make a big difference to ones stay one more thing i asked them if they could arrange a booking at a restaurant for us and the concierge flat out refused and told me they don t do that
