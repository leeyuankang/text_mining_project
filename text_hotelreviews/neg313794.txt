the first room given did not have working hot water which was only found out when stepping into the shower it was very inconvenient then we were told that nothing could be done till the morning so two cold showers later we were moved to a room which had hot water these things should be checked before giving the room to a guest the rooms are too dark and pokey no conditioner in rooms had to ask for bathrobe and slippers in the second room
