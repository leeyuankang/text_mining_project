rooms unfortunately are not well kept and feeling tired front rooms are very noice as windows are single glass no sleep on our first night from the noice we had to change rooms in the middle of the night back rooms are tasteless furnitures are old we had to check out on our first night as we did not like the front or back rooms at all we paid little more and went to a beautiful hotel further down
