the rooms size view and bed type were not what we excepted to have from the pictures we were a group of families and had to wait for couple of hours to check in and get some descent rooms we booked rooms in total there is no coffee maker or kettle for making tea coffee inside the rooms like other hotels in cafeteria there is a coffee machine but is not working properly other issue we had in one of our rooms the house keeping took one of the shopping bag along with the receipt and one tiny shirt in it most probably without noticing there is some stuff inside the shopping bag we complained to the reception and they refused to accept this and we were disappointed by their response so be careful to put your stuff inside closet the closet is not built in and not very tall for your tall clothes also no drawers for you to put your stuff no mirror inside the room no iron the washroom doors are made of glass which is bad as you have no privacy inside the toilet in of our rooms the telephone were not working and internet connection was poor during our stay for a week they did not do anything to fix it the washroom in the basement most of the time had no soap men and women washroom has the same basin common area to wash your hands which makes you feel not very comfortable if you are a lady so i do not recommend this hotel if you are a family or a single lady
