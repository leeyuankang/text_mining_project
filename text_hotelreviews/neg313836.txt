the place looks like it is not maintained well probably due to high traffic they seem not to take care of the rooms for the normal tear and wear also we had to request slippers no bathrobes for a is expected no toilet brush the door from bathroom is from glass which is not good during the night when you have to turn on the light the other person is disturbed by light they have a big problem with heating it is done through ventilation not passive elements so it is really noisy turning on and off i could not sleep well because of the noise you can setup the fan speed but in our room only high mode was working apparently should take care of that
