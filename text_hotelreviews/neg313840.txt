the room did not have a nice view but was really quiet so its not a minus but more choice as hotel has also street facing rooms for us quietness was important and view much less they should remove the strong scent from the lobby its just artificial though nice modern and i am sure that employees hate it so not really necessary for overall nice ambient of the hotel
