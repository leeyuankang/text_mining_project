jacuzzi in the bathroom is always a plus but the bathroom wasn t clean rooms aren t soundproof lots of street noise that in addition to the fact that it s hard to keep daylight out with the curtains they have chosen makes the place ok for leisure if you don t need to have a real good sleep perhaps but i wouldn t recommend it for business trips
