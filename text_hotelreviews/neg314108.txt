we booked the hotel for it s proximity to ceuvel cafe unfortunately due to extensive roadworks in the area what should have been a short minute stroll was more than doubled the rooms are ok but nothing special once you re inside the big yellow box there s nothing to distinguish it from hundreds of other chain hotels overall poor value for money
