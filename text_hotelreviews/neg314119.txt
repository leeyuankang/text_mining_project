would have been nice to have known about the happy hour in the bar this won t apply to most people but one reason we chose this hotel was because of the advertised electric vehicle charging point however it needs updating for newer type vehicles with one of the sockets being the latest socket or an adapter available staff also need training in procedure for hooking up travellers from overseas will also need a complimentary connection to the charging network as dutch network uses different smart cards to activate charging
