when we arrived it was hard to find the hotel maybe a bit more information how you get there either take ferry at back of central station it s free runs all day and when u get off walk up main street and can t miss tall building with nd hotel on it or catch number bus outside central station and its second stop monsplein and cross road and hotel in front of you that was only problem we had
