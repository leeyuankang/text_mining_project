cleanness of the hotel should be improved dust on the walls dust on the floor bathroom cleanness was really bad elevators was really dirty and i believe nobody was cleaning those for long time staff has strange understanding about client service upon my arrival the reception lady asked me to wait and left for few minutes and she was discussing something with other reception guy i was asking her to serve me first and only then continue internal discussions with colleagues all in all the location is good hotel should be maintained better and then this is good place where to stay
