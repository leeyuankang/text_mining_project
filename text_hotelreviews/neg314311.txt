this hotel has no option as a duvet and only a blanket thermostat does not work properly at all the view was into the grave yard what was quite creepy housekeepers tend not to clean the rooms at all only make the bed and change the towels and leave dirty cups or not replace with clean ones at all the room offers only paper cups but no tea coffee cups whatsoever and after us using them they are are never replaced also no matching towels and all of them were teared apart or grey and the most important receptionists were ignorant and rude people in the restaurant were rude as well and rushing away after breakfast or moaning if you are using extra plate we didn t feel very much welcomed in the hotel at all
