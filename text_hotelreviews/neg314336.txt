the neightbourhood around the hotel is really shady there s a penitentiary for women just a stone throw away to get to the metro station you need to walk along a suspicious street with ppl looking at you like you were to do sth bad if you head straight to the beach and walk along it it s ok the queue for the breakfast was enormous there isn t enough seats in the dining room for a hotel that big when i was finally seated i went to get some food and in the meantime my table was given to somebody else and i was asked to join somebody there were no amenities in the room no pen no paper not to mention lack of iron or tea coffee which are quite standard in star hotels the room was very basic like star basic standard rather than it was clean though the remote for the tv didn t work but i didn t even bother getting a new one i definitely won t choose this hotel if i go to barcelona again in the spring
