rooms should be cleaned a bit better and it s not acceptable to leave new towel with stains as well bathroom sink was clogged and they were not able to fix it hotel restaurant could be a bit better i didn t like that they wanted to charge me day for renting a kettle and it was not possible to have a late check out however overall it was a great hotel
