we made a reservation for a stay in the bar on the top floor the same evening we arrived the lady helping us stated that the reservation was made when we in the evening wanted to go there another employee was present and he told us that there was no reservation no chance to get one while they were for days already fully booked he approached us very unpleasently if we would have known this before we would have made other arrangements now the evening was just destroyed back to the room then where the tv would not work i will not use this hotel again
