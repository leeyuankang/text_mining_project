the interpersonal skills of the young girl on the reception for the restaurant could have been better tried to book a table as we returned from a very hot day out in vienna to be told rather judgementally as she looked me up and down that there was a dress code i was wearing shorts at the time on arriving for the meal was told that there was no booking in my name the restaurant staff at this time were very helpful and friendly and found space for us and we enjoyed a delicious meal
