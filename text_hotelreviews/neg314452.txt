receptionists are weird insisted on prepayment weren t polite when i was checking in one of the guests was trying to bring a prostitute in the room and calmly discussing it with the other receptionist while in vienna center it is in isolated area with no free cheap parking nearby hotel parking is eur day but there is donau city residence parking nearby for eur day the area around is extremely windy and uncomfortable at winter i think it s all more or less ok for a business hotel but if you are travelling with family it s better to choose something else
