real bad value don t even know where to start their average room rate is eur per night they claim stars but don t even have a real room service after pm they had nothing to eat only toast and no wine they made an exception for us and brought us some wine that they collected from somewhere else we came at xmas time and there was barely any christmas ambience the hotel ihas yet to invest in decorations the walls in the hallways and floors are huge and totally empty the floor hallways resemble those of a bankrupt shopping mall there is no furniture and no decoration whatsoever unbelievable the place is soulless the bathroom designer should be fired on the spot all black and dark maybe they think it s chique but they have little clue about proper interior design also not even an iron or heating element in the room the ac made a terrible noise the separation walls are made of sheetroc not concrete you can hear your neighbors unbelievable in such an expensive place the lounge restaurant on top is a joke they think they really are something the poshness of the staff is silly another couple we met had exactly the same opinion and what to offer except for rediculous expensive drinks and waiters begging for a tip approaching your table literally every minute there is zero view of interest either you may be high up there melia but you yet have to grow a lot and also here please start decorating the place it s totally barren except for tables and chairs there is nothing not one painting or anything on the walls zero character zero warmth forget the top floor all together been to tons of so much better sky lounges all over the world without the rediculous pretense and prices and actually with a real view who wants to look down on nothing around this is by far the worst sky lounge ever sorry but true people come only since they claim to be the highest floor in all of austria
