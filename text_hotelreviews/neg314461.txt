the maids ask to clean your room at circa i have travelled a lot and have never experienced this i understand they want to get the job done and it is a big hotel but it should not be expected that all guests are out of the rooms let awake at such an hour on their vacation we were disturbed again even after i popped the do not disturb sign on and again on our check out day by the minibar man we did not and do not intend to formally complain however had this happened to the wrong lind of guest i am sure they would have escalated it to mangement our bathroom door was broken as well as the coffee machine which was eventually replaced and also our heating wouldnt work so it was just blowing cold air
