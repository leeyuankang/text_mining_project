even google maps wouldn t find the hotel and on the way out there s no clear signsage nor direction to take you nether to the city nor to the airport we received misleading information about the executive lounge and we checked out not knowing whether there is actually a lounge and what would the supplement charge be to gain access to it not all the members of staff weee friendly poor breakfast buffet not so much choice neither variety of food and very much overpriced for what it is i usually stay at the intercontinental prices are but much different but the experience is way better let alone the location
