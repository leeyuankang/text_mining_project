we arrived at the hotel from airport at and to our surprise the room was not ready and the girl at the reception told us that it will be ready in one hour and reacted that it s not a big issue then when i showed my resentment she offered us voucher for drinks in the first floor restaurant if you decide to drive to the hotel then good luck to find your way through the maze of tunnels leading to it
