i booked a hotel with a nice view so i was very upset to get a room on the lowest floor with a view to the roof of the restaurant very frustrating this hotel is famous about its view to the city that is why i booked my room here anyway the staff is not very helpful and unexperienced they made several mistakes during which is annoying after a while
