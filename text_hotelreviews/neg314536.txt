it wasn t particularly child friendly we stayed at the hotel for the start of our honeymoon and we took our little baby with us the hotel restaurant and cafe didn t seem like the type of places you could take a teething baby and there weren t any child friendly restaurants nearby next time we d stay in a different location also the staff didn t mention anything about our honeymoon it would have meant so much to me if they d even just said congratulations also we were put on the floor probably because we had a baby with us so they didn t want him to disturb the important people on the higher levels but we were moved to the exact same room on the floor because a door was broken so at least our view was a bit reasonable i would have liked a kettle to make tea and an iron as standard
