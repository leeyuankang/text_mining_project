it was the first time in my life life when i was told i should wait till p m to check in i like hotels where you feel like a dear guest and the staff try to do everything you feel like at home here is the atmosphere more like you are allowed to stay here the hotel is rather expensive and it is rated as stars so they could care about their guests a bit better they don t have swimming pool the parking costs eur quite expensive
