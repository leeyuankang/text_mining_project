staff treated us like we were some weird people coming from the street i do not expect the staff to know who a certain customer is but it should always think about that the customer might be someone with influence on their business restaurant receptionist was pretentious and rude breakfast in the room was completely messed up on valentines day wrong products and missing products aswell overall i have to say i am not going to stay at this hotel ever again i can only recommend to stay at the classic star houses in the city sacher palais imperial at least you get treated like a king there for the price you are paying
