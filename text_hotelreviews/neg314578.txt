the one thing we didn t like was the general vibe of the bar at the top of the tower we felt very out of place and one of the waiters was incredibly rude to us because we accidentally sat down at an occupied table no one was sitting there and the glasses were empty that immediately ruined the great mood i was in and we decided to leave without having a drink the flow bar on the ground floor was much more welcoming and the lady who served us was fantastic
