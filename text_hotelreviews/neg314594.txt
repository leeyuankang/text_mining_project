the staff was not very helpfull in many situation e g the room was not ready when we arrived to check in even we announced our estimative hour of arriving or not proactive in another e g i called them from downtown and asked them to help us and call us a taxi in the new years eve night but the receptionists told us they will and they did not even call to a taxi company and we rely on this in a very cold night and in some cases quite impolite the breakfast time was very crowded with insufficient tables and i must asked a staff member times to clean out our table after the previews guest the hotel is a little far from the city center the prices are too expensive for the quality of services that they offered and this is too bad because otherwise the hotel is quite nice
