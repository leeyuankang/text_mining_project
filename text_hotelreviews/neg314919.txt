it s an old building and most rooms are small but that can t be changed and doesn t matter hugely unless you have a need for rooms like small apartments however if i d paid a star price i d have been disappointed with the many of the room facilities e g warm minibar small tv minimal towels few toiletries no tea kettle but then maybe if i d paid full price the offerings would have been different so given the low rate i paid which my viennese friends could hardly believe i m not really complaining
