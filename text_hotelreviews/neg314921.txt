a small room for the toilet was separate from the bathroom both within the room of course the problem was that the toilet room was not connected to the central ventilation system so no way to ventilate the toilet room we had to open the room windows in freezing temperatures while we were out of the room when we asked about this they were ok with us changing rooms but the entire ventilation system in the hotel was not working during our night stay this was not fixed
