i still recommend this hotel but minor things worth mentioning just for clients to be prepared single blankets only hotel does not have doubles no kettle in the room you need to go downstairs to the restaurant for tea or any other hot beverages very inconvenient during winter stay or when it s cold outside i also had to remind about getting robe and slippers
