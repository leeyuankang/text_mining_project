dear hotel management as a very dissatisfied customer i registered on booking com on purpose just to leave this comment on your hotel page i would like to highlight some very important negative points the first and the most important is the breakfast which is literaly disgusting we had the impression that not a single product presented during the breakfast was fresh and of good quality the juices taste like yuppy and are undrinkable the milk tastes like the one made of powder with some water added in it if you come at around am the buffet is almost empty there are no clean tables you need to wait the food which is supposed to be heated up during the service hours is cold and has no taste the staff is rude doesn t speak english well if you answer their question in english they still reply in spanish nice and is too slow to assure a good quality of service during breakfast some signs indicating what kind of dish was presented were missing always not enough mugs and plates you have to ask the staff to bring them to you so you wait and for all this you pay euros it is a pure robbery to make people pay for a sh tty breakfast like that on the second and the third days of our stay we had breakfast in the restaurant not far from the beach which was much much better and cheaper the room the ac system was broken when we arrived so it was hot as hell during two days the room was noisy itself but also there was a staff room just next to us where cleaning ladies keep their products and towels sot they felt free to discuss their daily issues very loudly just next to our door early in the morning not caring if someone hears them or not or is sleeping for example the room looks old pretty used and old fashioned the bathroom is not very well cleaned and after the cleaning lady passes by you still see some dust in visible areas the general level of professionalism of the personnel at the reception area leaves much to be
