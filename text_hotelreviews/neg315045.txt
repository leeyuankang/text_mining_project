unfair day p m friday tired after many hours driving i check in at medinaceli and get a room on ground zero behind a door just back the concierge desk and once i enter wow i am little kid again back to the seventies i am not particularly fond of antiques and so i report to the young boy at the entrance that this is not the room i saw pictures on booking booked and already paid for he replied that the hotel is fully booked and that i ve got a room in the old part of the hotel just for the record no mention of it on booking i insist i wish to change the room and he said they re going to try next day well maybe if i switch on the tv set i ll enjoy last episode of kojak day up for breakfast a smiling man at the desk tells me they succeeded in having finally my room but not earlier than p m so still with suitcase unpacked i go out come back late at evening get the key for a room on floor and kojak again come on what i am on scherzi a parte i rush down i don t like to be fooled again the young boy of day again the bla bla bla of the fully booked hotel i want to talk to the manager in charge he replied not available call him her not possible he comes tomorrow i asked for a name which i get without surname i asked about surname of the boss and he pretends he doesn t know it i asked for compensation since the room i ve got is not worth the price they are charging me and above all differs from the pictures they put on booking guess what no compensation i am so frustrated and go back upstairs and back to the seventies i call booking customer service in italy and finally i get assistance from a very gentle person thanks mr marco casarin to whom i explain what is going on and after few minutes he tells me that spoke to medinaceli and they are going to try to change my room the day after but cannot grant it today i will have to spend another night with unpacked suitcase and kojak
