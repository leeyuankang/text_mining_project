staff very young but doesn t know how to deal with clients they may ask you to pay something that is already paid so be careful if you ask for an invoice it is too complicated and it takes hours for them to stamp one invoice internet doesn t work properly so that their system doesn t work so your check in and check out may be without proper documentation and no invoice afterwards they don t try to solve problems they just wait and do when they want
