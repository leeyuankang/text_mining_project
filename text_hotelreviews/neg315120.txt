the king bed was actually a queen bed and was done from single beds that were split during the night the minibar was empty at star hotel this is not acceptable at breakfast we arrived at when they close at and we asked bread and vegetables because there were not anymore and the answer was that they close at it s late and they have to check what they have also the bread was mixed from that day and from previous one leftovers tables in breakfast area were crowded no place to pass without disturbing people that were eating no smoking area you need to smoke in front of the hotel overall quite disappointing experience
