our bedroom was the smallest we have ever stayed in we struggled to get our suitcase open to unpack it was a ground floor room but the windows were locked closed so not possible to let any fresh air into the room breakfast was just ok not a great variety of either cold or hot food not what you would expect from a hotel with a star rating
