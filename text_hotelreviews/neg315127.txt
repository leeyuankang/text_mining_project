we had a problem with the temperature in the room very cold uncomfortably cold the front desk came in and agreed they would not escalate the issue to management we left so they could resolve the issue instead we got a room heater we used it sparingly in addition the light bulbs were out so it was very dark i felt management missed the mark since a large grand hotel was or miles away
