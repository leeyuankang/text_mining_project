my one and only complaint was their room service schedule they make the rooms first for new guests first then they do the stay overs we were always in the room getting ready for dinner at when they wanted to come so we never had our room cleaned and had to get fresh towels and sheets from the front desk room service in the late afternoon is way to late for our standards
