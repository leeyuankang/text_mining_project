i thought overall the room was too small and cramped for the price i had payed it should have been labelled penthouse room rather than suite our bed was two singles pushed together the bathroom didn t have a fan and all the walls were pretty thin so it s not so private on arrival the room was very dirty which definitely was not a good first impression
