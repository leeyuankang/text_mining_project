we ordered a small double room with booking com and you then ticked whether you wanted a twin room or double bed as i was travelling with my partner i ticked a double bed but we ended up with two single beds put together which meant you got a dip in the middle and then you ended up with a back ache i mentioned this on the first morning of our stay and was told they would swap it for a double bed i was then happy when we returned later that night the beds had not been changed so i then went back the following morning to mention it again the manager then came to have a look and they said they can t guarantee you a double bed as they only had eight double beds throughout the hotel and they didn t have any available so we was stuck with it she said she has never had this complaint before i said that was the options available to us they would not offer a refund but they were very sorry no complimentary water in our room on arrival as stated there could be more choice for breakfast
