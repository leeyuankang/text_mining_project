when we arrived we were due to pay for the hotel which was as we were not able to pay upon booking we got charged over which was a crafty move we also requested a double bed as we are a couple and got two twin beds it was not a busy time and feel this simple request could have been met the room itself was situated on the ground floor about steps away from a school playground we had to get ready in the dark as our curtains could not be opened or all the screaming kids in the playground would be able to come watch us getting changed the lighting in the hotel room was appaling so we were mainly in darkness as we did not want people passing by or the school children peering in the noise was unbearable and the location was awful i would never recommend this hotel the cleaner did not replace the coffee and left cleaning products in the room we felt very undervalued and that we had been given the worst room in the hotel which should not be used i have nothing good to say apart from the reception had a nice smell
