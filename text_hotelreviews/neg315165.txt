this is a three star hotel charging four star prices the rooms are very poorly sound proofed so you can hear other guests yelling at each other in adjacent rooms and staff yelling down the corridors seriously why is everybody having a shouting match in this hotel the blinds don t close properly letting light through all night long so much for a good night s sleep there was an unleasant sulfurous smell in the bathroom and the seal on the shower door is broken which means any time you take a shower you ll inevitable flood the entire bathroom lots of other comments mentioned this problem but the hotel apparently can t be bothered to fix this commitment anyone staff didn t seem very welcoming at check in they did their jobs but seemed to just be going through the motions the building also has an austere unwelcoming feel which i can t quite put my finger on i really only chose this hotel because i needed someplace to stay for the holidays that was within easy distance of the relatives i wanted to visit in amsterdam this hotel met those needs but i wouldn t stay there again even if you account for the holiday season s inflated prices i feel like i paid far too much for what this hotel delivers
