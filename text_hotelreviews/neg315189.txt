i recently stayed for nights and over all i enjoyed my stay but i would not stay again the first thing and the main problem is the sewage smell in the bathroom that is so bad it stenches through your hotel room and on to all your belongings having asked about it and waiting for room service i had to reask before someone came to my room very efficiently they lifted the drains in the bathroom and proceeded to bleach the pipes a common thing they tell me although it isn t stated on their website the smell went but would still come back so rather than uphold my holiday plans any further by waiting i would advise to squeeze bleach or shampoo down the shower grill on a regular basis or you will never enter the bathroom again even the cleaners were gagging i also wasn t aware that you share the hotel with residents people that actually reside in the building on a regular basis and directly next door is a mental institution so be aware again that when you book you may be accosted by these people on your travels they mean no harm but it is very daunting if you are not comfortable with these situations the hotel offers room service but not with breakfast which i found surprising and as a private person who didn t want to join others for breakfast i could not find any where near that did a good english breakfast however cafe bratavia on central station do one to die for you must try it and only the room was cold the tv only has dutch channels very scarce to find an english programme and you only get cushions to sleep on not pillows if we sat on our balcony we could see the people in the room next door use their toilet as the bathroom is directly in the window where we sit i was forced to inform the gentleman that i had seen everything when he went to the toilet it is not an ideal situation and very inappropriate
