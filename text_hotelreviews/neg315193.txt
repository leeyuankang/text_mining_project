one colleague checked in later than myself and the others and the guy at reception just started his shift was presented with a problem someone else had checked into my colleague s room the receptionist was not professional he did nothing to make my colleague feel at ease if anything he gave the impression that this guy had stolen her identity which was incredibly worrying and it took an hour to sort out so my colleague could go to bed in another room having confirmation that her details were no longer associated with that other room that a mystery guy was in
