the room was far too small for two people with less that feet on either side of the bed and a space to squeeze through only for one person between desk and bed and no room anywhere to put suitcases or anything on a table it was more like a large closet than a hotel room so that the room size belies the name of the hotel and for this reason seems quite overpriced the bathroom and especially the shower was very small also we asked for a wake up call but that request was ignored and the telephone in the room did not work
