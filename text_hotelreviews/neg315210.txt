staff was friendly but not helpful at all when asked where to hire a bike both of the receptionists looked dumb and did not know the answer the next day i saw that there were hotel bikes available they did not speak dutch we had to ask for wifi codes and breakfast info ourselves etc i also didn t like the fact that i could not open a window in the hotel room
