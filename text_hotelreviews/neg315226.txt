i booked identical penthouses however we got only penthouse and the other frankly was not a penthouse rather than a tiny room with a very very huge terrace very weird design a c was not working and we requested to change the room and they eventually changed it after spending nights without ac weather was sunny and relatively hot amenities in the bathroom are so cheap terrace was full of bugs which we could not use elevator is extremely filthy staff were not friendly and i didn t see anyone smiling for nights
