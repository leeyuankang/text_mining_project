my husband and i stayed in the penthouse the room had a strong sewage gas oder someone should have known right from the start and should have not have hat room booked the room was dusty i m allergic to dust the headboard had mold and the refrigerator was not getting cold i took pictures my husband called the receptionist right away and they said there was nothing that they could do until the morning my husband wanted to talk to the manager but the manager is not available on the weekends which is ridiculous because a manager at any hotel should be available the receptionist said there was nothing they could do until the morning they said they would bring a plumber to check it out that night my husband and i went out and bought candles to get rid of the smell it didn t really help it made me so sick the strong oder i m actually sick now nauseous fatigued and a high fewer well my husband called the next morning at to see when the plumber was coming minutes later we get a knock at the door from the housekeeper she put some white balls into the shower drainage i took pictures of that as well then my husband and i get ready to leave early so the plumber can do whatever they needed to do we left the hotel at and got back at yuck the smell was still there of course my husband was upset and so was i so he called the front desk and told them we have been gone for a very long time in order for someone to fix the sewage gas leakage he said it s the weekend so it s hard to get anyone but they told us someone would be here they also said someone would be there to fix the refrigerator that didn t happen the nigh before my husband put beers outside our terrace they were gone the next day while we were out my husband and i was extremely upset and wanted to talk to the manager right away
