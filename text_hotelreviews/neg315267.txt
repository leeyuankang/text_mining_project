it was to far away from the dam square it cost us in taxi each way to get the centre a half an hour walk away from the centre which is to long and the staff wasnted very helpful when i asked about the trams the walls are like paper so thin that i could hear next doors conversation and also the cleaners arguing in the opposite room at o clock that morning i ordered a double room and i got two single beds pushed together i would not stay here again
