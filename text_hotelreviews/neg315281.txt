having paid approximately for nights we were expecting rooms at least slightly bigger than a tent we were staying in last summer rooms were very very small hard to turn around and fit with belongings we had for these nights and we didn t bring much which comes as a suprise in a star quite expensive hotel breakfast was o k although the selection was rather poor for a star hotel but for the last night we ordered a breakfast bag early check out the day before double checking in the evening but in the morninig it turned out that no one knows anything about it and there was nothing waiting for us even though we paid for breakfast during booking i dont complain usually but i would think twice about returning here
