would be nice if the room sizes were mentioned in the room description we booked the standard room over the small room but it also felt quite small didn t really have space to keep a big bag also it seemed more like a b b place with no room service and the most basic amenities the pictures they show on their site are of the complex in which the hotel is present which houses more hotels the windows of the room open on the road outside with everything visible inside the hotel needs to realize that it is booked by tourists from across the globe and not everyone is comfortable with it
