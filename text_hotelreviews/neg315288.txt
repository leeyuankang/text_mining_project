the hotel is not more like i was very disappointed with the unprofessional staff having burger and chips on the desk as i checked in i paid extra for a penthouse suite but it was tiny and below average the room was stifling hot and the ac did not help at all to cool it down the tv did not work not that it matters much but i like to watch the news in the morning there was hardly any space in the wardrobe the ironing board was like a broken toy the shower was dirty on arrival the worst aspect of the room was the sink shower drains smelt like sewage and because the room was small the smell was also in the room and greeted us every time we walked in
