basically the hotel is a set of residential apartments within a residential block altered to be hotel rooms the only shared accommodation is a check in and small breakfast area two floors above rooms are small and not ones that you would spend any time in seemed expensive for what we got but i guess all hotels in amsterdam are expensive no bikes available for hire but a hire shop just down the road
