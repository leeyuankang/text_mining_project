breakfast was expensive it was a bit strange to not find the reception at the entrance instead we had to go to the floor to check in this was not an issue but it s just something to be aware of as we felt a bit lost when we arrived and we were unsure if we had the correct address it is not a conventional hotel the building is shared with other businesses
