this is not a hotel don t be fooled it is like an air bnb claustrophobic rooms when mentioned to the hotel staff they responded you got what you paid for when i said the room is fairly small i only said this as i received an email suggesting that the hotel was going to make it special for us as it is our anniversary i felt they did nothing of the sort we don t drink and as it was our anniversary the hotel staff grabbed the two prosecco bottles from the bedroom table and said well we will offer the mini bar complimentary even though it is included in the price so didn t really do anything for us make sure you look at the cans before you drink also the bottled water is tap water filled up no seals on the bottle dangerous window in the bathroom fully opens which is surely a health hazard there is no stopper besides the shower head which it rests on when opened the room was freezing windows were left wide open therefore as much as i had the heating on the cold air was just not getting any warmer also so loud in the mornings as it s right next to a school college so beware of screaming kids issues with the internet connection after ringing twice for the assistant to come and have a look to then being told that i should go up to the floor and sit there to use it bathroom sink leaks i only noticed when i went to use the toilet and my feet were in puddles absolutely disgusting as you can image i rang the assistant and she basically said she can t do anything and will have it looked at the morning we check out in the meantime put towels there great organic breakfast not much selection at all and definitely not worth eur a head for eur a night definitely not worth it stay in the heart of the city or a reputable hotel trust me it will be worth it ruined our anniversary spent nearly hours in total complaining to booking
