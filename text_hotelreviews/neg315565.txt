the hotel occupies the part of residential apartment block the hotel reception is located in one of the apartments on the floor and not easy to find the breakfast is served in the same apartment as reception all the rooms are located at the back wing on the floor the rest of the building are private apartments to get from your room to the reception you will need to walk through an open air space so consider the weather condition very poor sound insulation between the rooms i perfectly could hear the person walk and talk behind the wall thankfully the apartment on the other side was dead quiet it wasn t probably occupied this is very odd place and star hotel rate is not applicable for this hotel it feels more like a family run bed and breakfast
