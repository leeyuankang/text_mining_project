this is not a hotel i think they would be lucky to have the building and the hotel arrangement is weird but that i could ignore the room was extremely dark after the sunset there is barely any lightning perhaps to hide how dirty they are from mould on the ceiling to dirty bathroom walls the cherry on the top was a chewing gum rubbed onto the floor by the bed when we notified the staff a friendly lady at the desk at that time offered us prosecco asked if we want to check out later even offered to attempt to clean it but since it was already o clock at night we just wanted to go to bed and there were no rooms to switch the lady promised to notify the manager so he can offer some amends sadly when we went there in the morning to check out his only offer was that they will clean it today after we leave while i was expecting at least a friendly glass of juice since we didnt order breakfast there really nothing in this hotel was satisfying the mini bar had diet cokes who even drinks that warm heinekens and an open refillable bottle of water the toiletries are two hanging containers one in the shower another one by the sink of the same pink soap that u can use for everything really material no paper tissues no cotton buds no cotton pads the toilet paper was this greyish recycled stuff they hang in public toilets really a very sad hotel experience lucky we needed it just to sleep
