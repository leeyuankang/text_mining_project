hotel room wasn t properly cleaned before our arrival we found cookies under the table and hairs on the bed lightning is terrible both in the room and bathroom window curtain was ragged room was not cleaned during our staying not once nor the towels have been changed overall one of the worst hotels i have ever been which is even worse having in mind how expensive it was not recommend at all and i must say i was really surprised with the booking com rating that the hotel has i usually agree with the hotel raiting on web but not this time
