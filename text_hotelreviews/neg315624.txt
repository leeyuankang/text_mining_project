this not a star hotel hotel is on the upper storeys of residential appartment area akward no sign of a safe location for family travelling together not clean for my standard especially the building shared patio downstairs and price is quite expensive for the condition when we arrived they told me that we need to move to other room the next day because shower is not warm they should have emailed us so that we have the option to cancel the reservation
