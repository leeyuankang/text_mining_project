check in process very slow we arrived just after another group and were left waiting a long time fridge did not work drinks weren t cold we passed this on to staff but it wasn t addressed hair dryer didn t work power very low the light on the shaving mirror did not work around the bed and under bedside tables was filthy loads of hairs and dust room was very dark would have benefitted from more lighting a bit of a strange set up not a normal hotel we found the building but finding the reception was a little challenging
