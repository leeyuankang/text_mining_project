booked one of the suites for a night as going to see a concert at wembley stadium be aware this is probably one of the most basic suites i have ever had and half of what was described as been in the suite is far from the truth no gown or slippers in room fully stocked mini bar was bottles of water complimentary chocolate was a finger kit kat upgraded toiletries which was the usual small bottles enough tea coffee facilities to make just cup each before having to go ask reception for more last bit is actually my own mistake none the less it s not what i would expect from a suite booking no breakfast included in the price i m sorry but when i book a suite i expect not be asked do i want breakfast or not i expect that everything is included in the price of per night honest opinion it was clean enough but very basic and is actually the standard of their top rooms is what i normally get for a basic double room just a little bigger but certainly not worth the money
