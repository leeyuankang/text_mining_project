the room was very warm and the air conditioning only worked intermittently the sliding windows were locked so couldn t be opened the staff we encountered were very rude however they were very busy so probably not enough of them on bar food was cancelled on thursday july as the staff were too busy and the a la carte restaurant was full we paid for nights because we booked months ago however the daily room rate was when we left on saturday july there should be a law against hotels hiking up prices to that extent when a concert is on at wembley however adele was cancelled and the rate remained the same after our first night a letter was put under our door to speak to reception we went downstairs and we re asked to pay for the following nights as the receptionist had only taken the first night on arrival we were told we d paid for our room in full twice but when we were checking out the receptionist got quite stroppy because of another colleague s mistake and we had to pay again before we left i now need to speak to my bank before claiming back the overpayment it was a shambles the hotel ordered us a taxi with no meter which charged us to take us less than a mile to the train station the taxi driver quoted our room number so there was clearly a financial arrangement between the hotel and taxi firm that felt like the last straw
