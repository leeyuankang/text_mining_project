hotel refused to keep our small travel case whilst we went out they cited security but we said please look inside at our little case and you can see it is not a bomb whilst we can fully appreciate the need for high security this was compltetely illogical and caused us a lot of hassle the receptionist had said we could leave our case in the case store when we checked in
