the water dripping constantly outside the entrance to room not related to the hotel but when we called for an early morning pick up to victoria green line coach station to catch a tour to cotswolds on may the driver didn t know the location neither did he have a gps tracker with him he fished out a physical map and magnifying glass to locate it ultimately reached our destination only because we had our gps on almost missed our expensive prepaid tour
