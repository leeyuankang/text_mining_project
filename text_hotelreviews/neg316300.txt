booked the executive suite and got no i believe but the bedroom was literaly next to the elevator shafts which you could hear very clearly so i rebooked it the other suite was booked already and got the executive no didn t slept half of the night because of some ennoying buzzing sound i told the reception and i had to wait about an hour for the maintenance guy to check it out whether it was the vent at the bathroom which they could not put off but i said this is not the sound which kept me awake so he came listened and said this isn t the bathroom vent but the equipment just above my room on the roof aircooler etc then after a few minutes another maintenance person came and told me he had shut off the bathroom vent but you still could hear the buzzing he said oh i could hear it when i came into the hall way he said well the whole roof is full of vents etc and he adviced to sleep one floor down they offered me a room and i checked it out no buzzing sound so i agreed and i asked the reception girl okay i assume i get a refund because i payed for the executive at first she acted like she didn t understand me this is a twin room i said i understand but i payed for an executive and this is a standard room isn t it finally she said we cannot give you a refund so i asked for the manager her alternative was keeping me at the floor as i paid for it and in this case en i waited on her she wanted to check it out for herself and gave me a cappucino she said don t hurry take your time so when i finished my cappucino i went to the reception and then the manager said oh well is already booked we are busy i said it has no use to relocate room away but still she insisted to one of the staff going with me to check it out but what i thought the same sound obviously it was also noticable there
