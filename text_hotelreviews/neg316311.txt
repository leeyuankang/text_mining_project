what bar does not stock up on alcohol and mixers for a big weekend no cocktails served due to a lack of ingredients watered down stella artois on tap our linens were not changed despite an obvious stain after day they were however flipped to hide it i assume the eggs at breakfast were a lot like milk soaked cardboard with no salt coming as condiment the toast was obviously a few hours old we ordered room service once upon arrival and it was a mistake not to be repeated received one wrong order and the other was plain disgusting nachos saturated with guacamole and a few cups of sour cream we asked for a complimentary electrical adapter which was advertised and were handed a stray one that did not work in any of the sockets with any of our devices eventually returned it and received a tough titties response from the reception if we hadn t gotten such a good deal on the room i wouldn t have taken any of this
