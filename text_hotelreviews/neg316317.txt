when we arrived at when asked if the kitchen was still open the staffed advised that it was closed hearing that we decided to use the pool facilities we then went out to look for something to eat we got back tk the hotel around we then asked one of the bar staff what time the kitchen was closed as we saw other customers still eating in the dining area we where told if this information was known by the staff on the front desk we wouldn t have to travel outside the hotel to find food as we had travelled for to get there and was very tired this was very disappointing
