worst experience ever the staff at the hotel should pay more respect to customer s privacy they opened my door twice without permission and with no reason the first time happened about one hour after i checked in the door was knocked and opened before i can even respond they asked if i m ok and then left i didn t call for help or anything really couldn t understand why they came the second time happened at about on the following morning hours before the check out time they opened the door without even a knock this time i was awake but still in bed i screamed and they left didn t receive an apology and any explanation from anyone before i left also during my stay the fire alarm set off for a while i ran downstairs and was told that it s actually a test on the alarm system i would expect them to tell this in advance or at least make an announcement when it happened to tell it s a test
