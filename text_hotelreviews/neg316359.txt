i stayed at the holiday inn wembley from for three nights i am very disappointed with the quality of my stay upon arrival i asked the receptionist for a quiet room as on the last night i would have to get up at and needed to sleep she said that she didn t know if the room was quiet and that in any case it had already been allocated upon entering my room i noticed it smelled stale so did my bed but decided against talking to the receptionists about it as they had not been very helpful before as i got into bed that night i felt itchy the same happened on the two consecutive nights while staying at your hotel i developed a rash that did not allow me to rest comfortably the rash on my body appeared on both legs torso and arms where my body was in contact with the sheets mattress i mentioned all of this as i checked out and the male receptionist said he would make a note of this i also asked for a wake up call at am but i didn t get one i sent two emails to complain with pictures of the rash attached but haven t received an acknowledgement or reply yet
