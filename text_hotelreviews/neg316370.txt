the restaurant my partners meal was bought over incorrectly when he said something the writer took it away to make him another one but of course because we wanted to eat together this meant that my meal went cold waiting when we paid the bill they knocked off my partners drink to apologise but not mine i think for the price of the food drinks and hotel room for the night the least they could of done would be to refund both drinks as this affected both our meals also in the hotel room there was only on hand towel for two of us we weren t sure if we had booked breakfast or not so went to enquire and apparently for that amount of money that didn t include breakfast and we weren t asked if we d like to add it so got brekkie on our way home somewhere
