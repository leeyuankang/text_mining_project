when i opened the window there was dead flies there which made me feel sick the bed was meant to be double i believed but it was two singles put together which was so uncomfortable for me and my husband i have a bad back because of the gap in the middle so painful and not comforting at all the swimming pool was dirty too the best thing i am happy with is the staff such great customer service
