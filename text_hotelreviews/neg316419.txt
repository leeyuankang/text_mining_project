first the package i purchased didn t allow me to have breakfast or any other consumable without paying on the spot and not charging the room as a frequent traveler never came across such absurdity second the hotel has no newspapers except for a chinese one and transport to and from practically doesn t exist for the hefty price i paid service close to nil another matter the rooms have no disturb signs so either employees barge in or pester it came to my attention the hotel had bds while they should be banned
