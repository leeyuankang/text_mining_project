reception check in cold not overly bothered or helpful instead just a process room requested for a disabled person with mobility issues upon arrival an unsuitable room was allocated with shower bath without necessary handles to allow disabled person to safely shower or use toilet this was brought up at reception who swiftly repeated its a request that they did not have to offer or contact us on disabled people do not ask for disabled facilities for fun it is requested so they can shower and use the toilet safely a phone call or email basic customer service to say a disabled room was not available prior to our visit would have enabled us to book elsewhere this is what most hotels would do eventually after some argument at reception with manager a disabled room was found and allocated having been refused earlier the new room allocated was much better although as much as we tried we were unable to get the heating to work so room was freezing and in the morning there was no hot water for the shower it was freezing cold though the sink tap did have hot water hotel fell below expectations was unpleasant and not the holiday inn we usually expect
