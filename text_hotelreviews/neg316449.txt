room not cleaned and when we questioned why we were told that they didn t have time we asked for it to be cleaned and went for a coffee whilst it was done unfortunately when we went back to our room it still had not been done we were approached by the floor manager who made it clear that we were being a nuisance the room was eventually given a superficial clean by an employee who didn t want to be there
