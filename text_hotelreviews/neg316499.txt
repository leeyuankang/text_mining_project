checking in wasn t great big queues saturday lunchtime restaurant wasn t open when it was advertised to be which caused everyone to cram into the bar at lunchtime not an ideal place to eat sitting on a low sofa breakfast not so good restaurant seriously overcrowded this time food very average overall hotel quite ordinary but very expensive
