the car we travelled in was meters high so we could not park in underground park there was some parking in front which the porter simply refused to allow us to park in as they were for special guests i complained to a manager and was allowed the first night night same story porter made such a fuss as if he owned the place there was plenty of parking there so we were not in anyones place also we were charged pound a night for parking food was not good at all i would steer clear of this place in future
