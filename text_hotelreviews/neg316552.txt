i booked and paid for a family room on bookings com when we arrived i had one bed with a sofa bed for the children the mattress on the sofa bed was full of broken springs and my kids had to sleep on the floor when i complained in the morning i was told that we didn t book a family room i showed the manager the confirmation from bookings com and they advised we will it wasn t passed through after a day out in the city all day we were tired and for the kids to have to sleep on the floor when i paid nearly for the night is was unacceptable
