the bath was quite small and i myself found it hard to be comfortable due to this i couldn t really work out the air conditioning and due to the heat was a little too warm most of the night the windows didn t open as much as i d like them too and as i understand that this would be for health and safety purposes this is still something i think could be improved when i was told that we would be having a room with a view i thought this may have been the stadium itself as we were disappointed to discover that this was not the case as we arrived into our room i think that the price of the hotel was expensive for the one night as i have noticed all rooms are cheaper on different occasions keeping the cost of the rooms a little cheaper even when there are events on would be a little better
