we had a superior room and stayed for two nights water and kit kats was a nice touch didn t realise this was only for the first night asked for some water on the second day and just got told no on the second day we had to get the key reset as the hotel had changed them so we couldn t get in our room and as we were on the floor this was pretty inconvenient also there must have been a milk shortage as we couldn t get any on the second day to many staff not talking understanding english properly
