the staff seemed pretty inept at the times i got referred to a different person at the desk times when asking for a comb to then find out that it was just in front of the first person it was also sad to see that the maid didnt speak english we had to tell her multiple times that we didnt want our room cleaned yet she came in to do it anyway
