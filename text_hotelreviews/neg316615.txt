the service was poor if you want a drink taken up they charge you if your there when an event is on they will charge you extra on parking so it costs for an over night stay the service was awful asin noone understood us when we was speaking to them my questions werent ever answered asin i asked what is the price range for prosecco and just gave me a menu to look at after asking for it they wanted to charge me to take it to my room beds were big but uncomfortable and there was hairs in it the shower was lovely
