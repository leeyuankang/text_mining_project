the room was not ready on arrival but a short wait only however on entering the room a strong revolting odour from the bathroom made us feel very sick and meant we could not enter the bathroom or use it we advised staff but it was not until we returned from the concert that staff reallocated us another room which was fine before the concert we ordered two sandwiches with chips this came hours later and with crisps instead of chips bar staff did however refund the cost the hotel was so busy and several people complained due to having to wait up to hours for a room staff were professional and did their best to help i booked this month s ago and so was disappointed with the room initially allocated but felt staff did respond as best they could
