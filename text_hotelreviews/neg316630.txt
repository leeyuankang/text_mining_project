i had booked rooms when i arrived at check in i was told that they only had room booked in my name i showed them my paper work from booking com and my phone app booking which clearly stated that i had booked rooms they still insisted that i had only room booked we eventually persuaded the lady on reception that an error had been made by them and not us and they gave us rooms
