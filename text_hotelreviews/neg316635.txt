check in could ve been slightly earlier as we d travelled a long way plus had to get ready for a concert we were attending also only slight criticism was how small the bathroom was plus the room rate seems to go up so much when there is an event on even the parking which is normally on a non event day goes up to a steep but other than this we were most impressed shall definitely book with you again
