customer service follow up is extremely poor nearly weeks after having suitcase stolen absolutely no contact from hi insurance company despite being assured that they would be in touch it is quite obvious that the management of hi wembley are keen to fob you off but nothing more despite being reminded of hi s repute and integrity and to be trusting of them quite frankly its all lies i have lost a suitcase full of personal belongings due only to the negligence of the hotel and despite requesting more than once not even a hotel report this is the last time i will have anything to do with holiday inn as any serious customer service issue will not be dealt with i really cannot understand how a suitcase can be lost within a secure luggage system and then so little after service when we live in a world where the customer is important and the customer comes first
