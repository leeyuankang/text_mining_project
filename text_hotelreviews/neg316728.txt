i really didn t like having to pay to park the car over night when we had already paid to stay also per person for breakfast is ridiculous no option was given to me either for bed and breakfast on the website when making the booking i didn t appreciate the cleaner walking into my room at either after one quick and very quiet tap on the door she walked in without giving me chance to get to the door first is not a suitable time to just walk in especially when check out is at we could have still been asleep
