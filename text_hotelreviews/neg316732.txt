we had a queen room which was just two big single beds put together that kept coming apart and getting a gap in the middle of the mattress which was really annoying whilst i was there i had an emergency but no first aider was sent to me whilst i waited for the ambulance my partner asked for a fan and some ice to keep me cool and they brought a fan that didn t work and a bucket of ice in a wine cooler sort of thing which didn t help
