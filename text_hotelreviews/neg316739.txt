we couldn t close the outside window in one of the rooms properly however when the inner window was closed and curtains were closed it did take most of the sound and draft away the sofa bed was a little uncomfortable and could have done with a little more space in the room as was a family room but for one night was fine also we didn t have breakfast at the hotel so can not comment but thought was a little expensive therefore had breakfast elsewhere
