we were disturbed times by staff in the morning at and each time staff gave a short knock and immediately opened the door and walked in this was totally unacceptable as check out is and it meant that we didn t get the sleep that we needed the air con was also uncontrollable and every time we turned it off it switched back on during the night and made the room really stuffy
