the cleanliness was poor in room and in everywhere else too the pool was closed for a day when we were there for days so quite disappointing for the kids for us as well but rather for them staff was so so some kind manager some rather useless no sofa bed was made up on arrival although notice was given no means for putting it up later either other than bringing the bedding over poor performance breakfast was under cooked in all means no any veggies was offered at all
