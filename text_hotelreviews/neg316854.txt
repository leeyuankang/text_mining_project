when i booked the hotel i booked two queens rooms to be given one queen room one budget room once we found this out hours later i complained to the reception we did get the correct room had we of been on our own and not with friends we would have been ripped off by being put in a budget room on floor instead of the queens rooms on floor not happy no sorry from staff ever
