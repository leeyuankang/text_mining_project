customer service from the bar staff leaves a bit to be desired they were informed twice of a spillage but just said it doesn t matter and ignored it despite being a safety risk i asked for chips to be told kitchens shut but if you go to your room then yes we finished our drinks went to pur room to be told no it s only pizza or sandwiches we chose a pizza and i found it a bit doughy and undercooked bit disappointed and the fact that i had to pay for it to be brought up when all i actually wanted was worth of chips in the bar
