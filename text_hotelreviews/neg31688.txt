excellent hotel we enjoyed our stay good value for money and the staff were excellent stains on the carpet but this was known before we arrived and an apology letter from the manager was already in the hotel suite suite there was a major problem with the booking which i believe is a booking com responsibility i had booked and paid for accomodation in advance but the hotel had no record of the booking in my name john hoffmann although it was not the hotels fault the lady on reception at the hotel when we arrived at went to extraordinary lengths to ensure we were accommodated
