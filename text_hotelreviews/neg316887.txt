we arrived at the hotel to check in and they had cancelled our booking as they were overbooked for the night and apparently the first ones they start cancelling are booking com ones after we had travelled for hours it took an argument with members of staff before asking to speak to the manager to confirm that we did infact have a booking although the rooms were nice the shower hardly worked and only had a slight cold trickle overall it was very overpriced for what it was i would expect to pay closer to to stay somewhere like that not
