the cleaning staff were very poor we were woken up at a stupid time in the morning way before we were suppose to check out then they cleaning staff still knocked on the door and hassled us more times before we left we ordered a room with a double bed what we got was two single beds pushed together we wasn t very happy as they kept rolling away from each other we had to constantly push them back together during the night we selected wembley stadium view and you had to press your face up against the window just to see the corner of the stadium finally the bar closed very early
