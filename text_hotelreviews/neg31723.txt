there was a tray of left over food left outside our room when we arrived and it was still there when we left we paid upfront to avoid any unexpect extras however were charged when we checked in incase of damages we were not expecting this and are still waiting for the money to be returned to our account breakfast was ok there wasnt a lot of choice none of the tables were cleared after people had finished eating so we had to sit at a table with other peoples left over plates as there were no staff around to clear anything things like this you do not expect for this type of hotel or the price
