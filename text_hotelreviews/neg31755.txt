i arrived at to check in but unfortunately my room was not available even though check in is from this was quite inconvenient as i had to get ready for dinner and didn t get into my room until after the gentleman at reception was extremely apologetic and did offer me off my bill had i arrived at as i did intend to but was running late i potentially would have been required to wait which really isn t acceptable i booked a bed suite and was offered a downgrade should i want a room immediately which again i didn t think was good enough why would i want to be downgraded i wouldn t have benefitted from this at all
