there was not anything to complain about really the only thing was slightly annoying was the fact the fire alarm went off at so of course not many people was happy but it can t be helped these things happen sadly it was nice they apologised straight away with a letter at the door when we walked out the door first thing in the morning i would of liked to see a more selection of hot foods as there was a lot of dry hot foods instead of mixed but other than that i can t fault it
