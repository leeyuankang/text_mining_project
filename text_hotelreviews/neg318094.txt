the hotel charged me for the parking place eur although i have already paid for it when booked the room with parking place i repeated it twice to the night shift and morning shift at the reception and even sent the booking confirmation at their corporate e mail but had to pay for parking anyway later on they sent the letter with the appologies and returned the money for parking but this question could have been solved in advance poor communication of the staff breakfast for star hotel could be more substantial and various and sauna could be for free for the visitors would not recommend the hotel to stay in
