the staff from the night when we checked in barely spoke english it took us minutes to get a bill and the keys there was a fire alarm and in our room it didn t work we were lucky our friends were next door and they woke us up when i complained to the reception the manager was very disrespectful and claimed that it was supposed to happen like that because the fire alarm was in a different area when my boyfriend complained too she said that the alarm in our room was actually broken i heard people complaining that it was not the first time when it had been a fire alarm during this week i don t recommend it at all
