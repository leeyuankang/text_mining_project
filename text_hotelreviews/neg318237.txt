wi fi only works in the lobby staff not very helpful unfortunately and they did not clear our room for the entire day the next day i had to ask for it they came but a quick minute just tidy up i was very disappointed as the value for money was so bad better to pay more and get a good value then ever staying here again i tried to explain to the staff in a nice way that they should work on improving as i also am in hospitality but no one was interested and very nonchalant
