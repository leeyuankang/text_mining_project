front desk staff made minimal effort to welcome us seemed uninformed gave poor directions no suggestions no material in lobby or room for tourists only hotel advertising big issue when we arrived after traveling over hours from los angeles minimal effort was made to welcome us it was pm no one else in lobby when given a room i specifically asked is this a nice room oh yes was the response the room was likely the worst room in the hotel an airless dark box at the bottom of the hotel next to an elevator shaft no outside window it was awful it was late and it was inexcusable given another room which was fine with a small terrace why wasn t that offered initially did the front desk person just think we were completely irrelevant bad way to start a trip in such a wonderful city rest of front desk staff metely adequate we were there nights would not recommend this hotel based upon front desk reception
