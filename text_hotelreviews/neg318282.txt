very small room hardly bigger then the bed in it there was no space to open the lagguages apart from the bed my biggest problem was the glass door on the bath room about distance from the walls around actualy if you sit on the toilet its from your partner who lays in the bed and there is nothing between you to block the strange noise and smell
