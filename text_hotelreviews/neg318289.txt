didn t like the fact when the room was cleaned they set the air con to very cold and left it running returning back to our room at the end of the day was like entering a walk in freezer people also put there towels etc on the sun beds in the morning and left them there all day even though they weren t using them so no chance of sitting by the pool unless you bagged one really early
