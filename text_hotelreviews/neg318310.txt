the check in service was terrible with rude staff that did not make us feel welcome at all we asked to change rooms as we felt a little claustrophobic in the room we had booked we needed to pay the upgrade charge but we were not told that at the time after going out for the afternoon we came back to a room that we were locked out of i paid the upgrade and they gave us new cards i would not stay here ever again it ruined my last three days in barcelona the other places we stayed at were fantastic
