i felt the concept is great as hotel art gallery but i feel it could be more exploited the lobby is amazing because it has a very nice setting and exhibition but not the floors i felt the floors are taking the theme of painters without really applying a nice identity the carpets reflect the main identity but they could have been done better my room was very tiny i don t know about the other rooms
