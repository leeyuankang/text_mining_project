there is a great minus in the hotel as the balconies are near to each other and they are separated by walls with holes you have to suffer from smoke smell all the time because lots of guests go to smoke on their balconies so if you do not smoke it will be hard for you to sit on the balcony or sleep with the open window because of this smell it s very inconvenient in summer
