there was zero sound proofing so you could hear absolutely everything in the hallways too noisy room was also claustrophobic with no sunlight noisy plus claustrophobic not good another thing i don t understand is the bedding something i ve seen at other hotels too where the bottom sheet is just slapped on top of the mattress and can t be tucked in at all so after you ve been in bed a few minutes the bottom sheet starts unraveling and crumpling up until you re literally sleeping on top of a messy tangle of linen i hate that
