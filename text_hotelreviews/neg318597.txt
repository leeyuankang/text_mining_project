air conditioning and lighting systems were a bit complicated my single room was very dark as the window looked out on to a narrow passageway due to insufficient lighting by the doorway i was not able to read the instructions on how to use the safe the breakfast was fine but there could have been a greater choice of cereals and bread this however was more than compensated by the attentiveness of the pretty and hard working waitress these comments are made however for the benefit of hotel management and not to deter f ture guests
