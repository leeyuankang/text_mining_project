the staff took less than minutes to make the bed clean the bathroom and clean the bedroom impossible the bed had a mattress protector which did not fit correctly therefore it was crinkled underneath the bottom sheet and could not be straightened so uncomfortable all night the lighting was terrible you could not see either in the bedroom or the bathroom so no chance to apply make up correctly we always book with booking com both in england and spain and this is the first time we have been very disappointed and felt we had to lodge our complaint
