the checking and checkout counter staffs if you meet a bad one is may be ioslated case but if meet terrible staffs than can safely say is the culture of the hotel to treat customers badly my first bad encounter after years of using booking com during checkin the staff can t find any card key to generate my room key so we waited for him to hunt inside outside for spare plastic card finally another female staff took out from counter drawer a big bag of card keys the checkout counter staff attitude is soooooo bad i don t want to mention as i m still on holiday not worth wasting time to remember bad thing
