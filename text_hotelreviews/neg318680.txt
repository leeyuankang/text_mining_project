facilities in the room were not good there is no main light in the room just bedside lamps and a desk lamp and a forest next to the window so there is no natural light at all very dark gloomy room and a small light above the door that offers little light to the room the shower dribbles out and the shower head cannot be moved from the bottom so would be great if you were ft tall i am and had to hold the shower head the whole time i was showering not very convenient at all it can also be perfect temperature one second then freezing scalding hot the next no shower guard so water just went on the floor tiles and was quite dangerous i slipped the bed was a very small double possibly even a double and be prepared to feel springs in your mattress the room was very run down and not what i expected from a best western the location is not necesarily the hotels fault but being in zone will cost you on the underground especially when you will have to get a taxi drive to the nearest station or walk for mins wouldn t recommend if you re planning on using the tube public transport to get around felt like it wasn t worth what we paid
