i opted for late check out when i checked in the night before but for some reason this information had not been passed onto the morning team who constantly kept knocking on my door asking me to leave without knowing i had already paid for a latter check out they kept constantly reminding me of the time that i needed to check out with the late check out even though i knew this information already and after a while it got a bit annoying the rooms were far from clean and i would not recommend this place to anyone but good service from the late staff though you re probably better off at a travel lodge
