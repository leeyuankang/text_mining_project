hotel staff asked me to confirm that i had booked breakfast when this should have been in their systems i also got asked to provide an auto approval for a pizza that my daughter wanted i was willing to using cash or credit card but i found the kitchen and restaurant staff members themselves not professional or respectful enough in their manner the receptionists were average the cleaning staff were very good helpful and respectful the carpet in the corridor is also extremely dirty and even the dining area could do with a proper clean periodically the room itself was ok although the carpet in the room could also do with a good clean the toilet also needs to be repaired as it takes quite a few attempts to flush it the site was attractive to me because of the onsite parking and the free wifi but the wifi was flaky at best and only worked in some parts of the hotel some of the time
