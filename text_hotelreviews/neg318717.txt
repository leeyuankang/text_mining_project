i stayed there for nights and because they did not give me a do not disturb card to put on the door the cleaners came into my room at and woke me and my partner up and also they came another times and that s when i went to the reception and complained in the night people were shouting in the corridor so i was able to hear everything and the walls are paper thin so you can hear the next door neighbours never going there again
