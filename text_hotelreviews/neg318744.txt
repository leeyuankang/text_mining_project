always out of items on the breakfast menu one morning they had no sausages and i was told it was a minute wait for fresh ones the following morning they had no beans at all completely out the tables were slow to be cleaned and prepared for the next guest i had to find the cleanest table i could find and on three occasions i had to ask for fresh cutlery they put me in a room in the same corridor as a coachload of screaming school kids then i returned on the monday to find the cleaner had emptied my room and moved everything into a room on the next floor obviously going into my bags in the process as things like my phone charger had been out inside my bag the room they moved me to had an air lock in the radiator and was constantly clicking quite loudly in the dead of the night which interrupted my sleep for the rest of the week at times the car park is difficult to get parked in until the bar empties i doubt i will stay here again this was not a good experience which is disappointing from a best western hotel as they are usually very good
