i stayed here booked double bedrooms exactly the same the second bedroom was for my parents and they had two single beds pushed together this was surprising comfortable and rather large as for my bed it was hard springs could be felt and it was the smallest double bed i had ever seen i don t see why both rooms were different i have a slipped disc and decided sleeping on the floor was actully more comfortable there was also a wedding on which proved to make parking ridiculous waited around in the car for mins before deciding i had to block another driving in as i had plans and needed to get ready i was told off for this but there is no other parking on site or near by after going back out again i had the same problem with parking and this was at at night i spent a good mins in total trying to find spaces and getting someone to back me on to the grass i was a paying customer and i was told parking was avalible which as explained before proved tough the wedding was rather loud and kept us up for a few hours as people were in the hall ways all in all not a good experience would appreciate a refund
