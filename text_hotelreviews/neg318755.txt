the carpet was pretty grubby and didn t look as if it had been cleaned in a while the room was located next to a wooded area and the windows had been left open so there were lots of insects flying around the room and on the bed which was horrid there was a party going on until the early hours which was really very noisy so could not get to sleep for ages
