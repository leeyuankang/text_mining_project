very small shower cubicle and a stiff folding door whilst the hotel has no control over other residents on the saturday night a group of old males drank outside till and then at started shouting to each other along the corridor slamming doors i do believe that when inconsiderate morons are identified they should be put on a black list used by all hotels to prevent others being inconvenienced
