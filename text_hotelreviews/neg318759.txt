the bed was extremely uncomfortable very lumpy and springy i had to sleep with my head at the feet end to find a barely comfortable position and woke several times the water pressure of the shower was awful it took minutes to wash and rinse my hair making me late it was a pathetic dribble the receptionist didn t seem too worried and just said oh sorry about that
