at check in the booking com reservation for a family room had apparently not made it onto the hotel s system we went up to the room and although it had a double bed and sofa bed the sofa bed had not been prepared cue a trip back down to reception un necessary and off to a bad start the room was tired with plug sockets hastily covered with electrical tape saying that we slept well and the bed was fine the following morning s breakfast was unpleasant as the restaurant was not very clean with filthy chairs and unwiped tables the food was of motorway service station standard with undrinkable coffee from a machine if i d paid all of this would have been understandable just but the bill came to including breakfast ripoff we were glad to leave
