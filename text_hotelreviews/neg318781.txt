the bus loads of chaines tourist who eating up all the food before nearly it was out of the kitchen they used up all the milk from the coffee machine instead of using the ordenery milk so other people could not have there cappuccino or cafe lat they where very rude and had no respect for other guests and no food left for other guests not even a cop of coffee and staff was struggling to keep up with refilling perhaps the hotel should try the idea to collect them in one of there big conference room and make a surten amount of food or make portions from a guest point of view it looked and felt that these groups where eating up the hole monthly food budget for the hotel this the only negative thing which is not direct the hotels fault but can be prevented so the hotel do not loose other guest because of big tourist group who have no respect for other guests
