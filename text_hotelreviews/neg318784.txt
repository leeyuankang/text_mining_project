there was a tapping noise coming from the radiator which was quite loud and irritating we spoke to the receptionist who was extremely helpful and moved us to another room however when we used the shower in our new room the water was constantly scolding hot and the temperature knob didn t seem to move we were contemplating going back down to reception but having already moved rooms once we didn t bother my partner had to lean over the bath and fix the tap himself which then solved the issue other than that the lady on reception was very pleasant and the location was good having pubs and restaurants just a short walk away
