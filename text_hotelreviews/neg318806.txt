the location of our room was very noisy we seemed to be above the kitchen fans which are running all the time my husband who is a light sleeper was kept awake by this pipes in the room were very noisy despite us turning the radiators off due to the heat in the room sofa bed didn t have the greatest of mattress on it but as my children are light this didn t seem to matter
