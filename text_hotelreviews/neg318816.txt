this hotel has a floor function room our room was above it on the floor the party might as well have been in our room it was so loud the hotel reception blamed booking com for not advising us when we booked that there was a function on until midnight it was a nightmare this hotel is totally unsuitable to simultaneously let rooms whilst holding a function
