we paid euros for nights and the room we got was small and it smelt of urine we then said we wanted another room as this doesn t make sense in terms of the payment made the hotel considers this as a standard room they then gave us the same room on a different floor but that was old and tired as the paint was coming off everywhere and the bathroom was not cleaned properly at the end we asked for a junior suite and got a good deal led by jose the receptionist thanks but again it was nothing special this hotel is not a global star hotel as advertised i have been to star hotels which were better the hotel is actually called hesperial hotel and only inside you find out that it is part of the nh group would i come here again for the same money no would i come again if it was based on value for money yes
