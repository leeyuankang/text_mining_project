the balcony whilst overlooking the sea great was noisy as it was directly facing a dual carriageway as a you had no coffee making facilities so if you travel to this hotel i would recommend you take your own travel kettle and a couple of mugs the price of the breakfasts we had booked without breakfast included seemed steep so we went out for coffee and croissants around the corner if you don t like heights then consider asking for a room on a lower floor as the balcony has a glass surround
