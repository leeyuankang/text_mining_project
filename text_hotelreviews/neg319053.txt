our gripe was that the room we got was not half a nice as the pictures on the website i m an early riser and picked this hotel partly because there was a nice looking armchair in the room for me to sit and read on there was no chair in the room at all meat i had to sit on bed which disturbs my wife who likes to sleep in on holiday there was no view of beach or balcony either as in pictures
