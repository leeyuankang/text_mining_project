we booked rooms with single beds and were told that they were not available we were given rooms with a queen size bed and a sofa bed we had a hard time trying to get them changed as we booked the same type of room again on the and were assured by novotel hotel staff that we would get single beds that did not happen when we checked in on we had to go through the same hassles again also when we checked out we were slapped with a hotel tax which we did not know about we thought that your price included all the taxes
