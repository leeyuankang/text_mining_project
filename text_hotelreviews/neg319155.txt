if you like accor hotels you won t be wrong this hotel has this very special atmosphere only big accor hotels have beside train stations and air ports these however are usually not that clean they make you feel like a number not a big one to be honest perfect professionality even friendliness is well trained just the bottles in front of my room s door didn t fit into this image of perfection the room is big enough big enough to put several things into it starting from a mini bar an enormous flat screen tv and some more furniture i didn t know what to use it for a desk was missing but brought by staff there was still space between the table and the bed so i could more or less sit the shower was brand new the ceiling that low water did not cool down while falling on my hat as i touches the shower head which is just about above the floor something even tall women have to keep in mind the breakfast room has a very special atmosphere as well it reminds me to class lounges on airports i enjoyed sitting on chairs without backrest my laptop on the table so i could play solitaire while eating my scrambled eggs the view was exceptional as well i had a great look at the backside of a dell notebook owned by some dude in a grey business suite probably bought from h m it was a bit noisier than my ears liked but i am lucky i own noise cancelling head phones so not a big issue
