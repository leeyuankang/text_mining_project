when we arrived there was a long and disorderly queue for check in this is very poor management only two of the four check in desks were staffed more staff should have been brought in to deal with the queue it is actually quite disrespectful to hotel guests who are paying for service i don t blame the staff who were on duty who were doing their best this marred an otherwise enjoyable stay
