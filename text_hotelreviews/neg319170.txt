very large hotel too many people and too few staff people pushed in front of me in queue on check in very rude big queues for check in and check out as only two people serving was served pizza that was frozen in the middle in restaurant luckily i was on the floor as lift wait time far too long so used the stairs breakfast chaotic large queues for orange and coffee probably a great hotel when it is quiet but felt sorry for the staff who i must say were all doing their best
