there were a couple of things missing which i expect from a star hotel there was no tooth brush and no tooth paste you have to ask at the reception for the saune there were no slippers and no bathrobe if you like to go to the saune you need to go to the reception first to get the key encoded otherwise you stand in front of closed doors that was very annoying a minibar was missing was well the room service at night is useless and the menue in the room just a fake menue so all in all it was a pleasant stay but the star rating is just too high
