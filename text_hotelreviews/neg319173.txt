as soon as we got there they asked us for another as an extra deposit and we was told we d get it all back at the end of our stay when we come to check out we was told that we were only aloud back because they take off city tax and some other stuff which we weren t told about i was very angry about this it wasn t written in the small print and made our trip a lot worse because we was down before we even started our trip which made us short of money for our time there and couldn t do all the things we wanted to because of being short of cash
