be careful when booking this hotel when we arrived for check in we was told we needed to pay and extra in case we damaged the room this does not state this on your booking once made after explaining this to the gentleman who works at reception he said it was compulsary but yet it didnt not have any inofrmation of this on our booking not impressed at all the way the man handled the situation and asked to speak to a manager who sorted it straight away also because we did not pay the we was told we couldnt use any of facilites bare this in midn when booking
