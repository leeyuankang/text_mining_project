nearly missed my flight because i had to query mistakes on my bill i had to take a taxi instead of a train which cost me more night staff not particularly helpful especially older staff seem to be secure in their job maybe time for retirement for some wrongly charged deposit on my debit card which also contributed to my nearly missing flight my year old daughter is autistic and was served absolutely scalding hot pasta that came from children s menu we didn t complain as the waiter was nice but she got a nasty mouth burn and refused to eat it i blame the chef in this instance
