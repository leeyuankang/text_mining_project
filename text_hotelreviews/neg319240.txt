for the price we paid and for a stars hotel i wouldn t expected a provisional charge of refund at the departure for the mini bar composed of just bottles of water sparkling and mineral each plastic cups and some small bags of tea and instant coffee just bag of sugar but plenty of milk shower water pressure kind of low took about half an hour to fill in the bath tub room kind of noisy late in the night and early in the morning heard everything happening on the hall no way to sleep more i wouldn t rate this novotel as stars the price is proportional with the reputation nothing more for a weekend or nights the hotel is just ok good to have a clean room and cozy bed after spending the whole day walking in town
