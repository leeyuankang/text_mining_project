we found some kids bracelet under the bed so i guess they dont clean to well atleast under the bed the staff in the reception were terrible one receptionist was checking in guests for over minutes the other was on the phone the entire time the third was standing in the members vip checking and doing nothing so since we arent vip we waited over mins to check in and once the we got to the receptionist he picked up the phond and carried on making calls arrangements while cheking us in dint seem to care to speak to us i guess if you are a member of novotel then its good but for us non members it seems like we arent wanted there
