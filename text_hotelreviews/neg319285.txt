there was a cockroach in the room which i had to kill i didn t have enough time to inform the hotel i was surprised as this is a star hotel the tea cups in the room were plastic which is a bit of a shame the shower bathroom was standard the tv remote was difficult to use you have to go out of your way to point and change the channels most of the staff were friendly however some seemed not interested at all
