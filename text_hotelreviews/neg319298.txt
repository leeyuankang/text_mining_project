we came at a really busy time so we were waiting for quite a while to check in the trip from the tram to city centre was long enough when we got there we were asked to give a deposit that i wasn t aware of but have and when leaving i was informed i had to pay a city tax and was only given back which would stop me coming again as i already payed for the room too expensive
