it was quite a way out of town but suited me as my partner s event was in the holiday inn next door breakfast was quite pricey so did not use there was was a constant like ticking noise which changed in speed and loudness most of the night may have been running water from other peoples bathrooms put my earplugs in so did not disturb me
