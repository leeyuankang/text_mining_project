the service at the check in desk was inefficient to put it mildly first of all checking in took ages because they had to produce vouchers for breakfast for everyone in the group persons for every day of our stay nights so pieces of paper with names and dates handwritten on each one like they used to do it last century they did have a computer but it didn t help much there was a complete mess in their system as regards pre payment and dates of stay one of the guests was denied access to her room in the middle of her stay because the hotel required a guarantee of payment for extras worth euros though the credit card had been authorized on day checking out took as long as checking in as they had to print out every single invoice for each of the guests accommodation separately from breakfast and tax fees though the entire stay of the group had been paid in advance by one credit card in one go they tried to shuffle off the blame onto booking dot com saying that if the booking had been done directly via their own system everything would have gone smoothly but i sincerely don t see why the quality of service at a four star hotel should depend on a booking company
