i really disliked the wc paper too hard and rough also we didn t know how to heat up the room it took few hours to try this and that and only after then we called the reception and we found out that the heating control was somewhere else and we should not use the air conditioning system qute bizarre experience i wished they would tell us that at our arrival that the airco is separate from a heater
