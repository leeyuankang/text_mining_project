i did not like the fact that when i booked the hotel through booking ie for and when i checked out of the hotel i was charged i was totally unaware that these charges would be added to the bill i was unaware that i had to give them a security deposit but it is standard for hotels to do that so i didn t mind but my card declined even though there was enough fund available to take the security they asked for another card to pay this so my girlfriend used her card to pay this when we arrived to dublin airport we tried to withdraw money from my girlfriends account but could not do so as they had taken from the account aswel as from my account resulting in us been stranded in dublin for hours until we could get money brought to us i am totally pissed over this stay and will never again stay with them i would like some sort of return as i feel i have been totally ripped off
