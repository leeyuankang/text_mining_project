the only thing i d say what i didn t like was the policey on weed smoking which your in amsterdam it is obvious for a year old to try it i just felt i was judged walking in by the security staff and i had to walk out of the grounds of the hotel which is fair enough but to then getting a look up and down isn t what i want every time
