when checking in at the hotel my credit card was preauthorised extra eur then i booked the room there was no information about some extra fees obviously i asked why it was so i got the answer that they are sorry that booking com and some other service provider do not inform the clients about this frankly to me it looks a bit different i believe that the hotel does not give a full info to booking com i was told that this eur will be released days after i do not see a big problem about it only be decent and update your info and don t look for an excuse
