we weren t aware we could upgrade to a room that had better view for nye at least to the opposite side to see the fireworks also since we had small children wish the staff member would of mentioned the city had a fire work show prepared for that night instead we had no idea and ended up going to dam square with a taxi to turn around and come back to the room since fire crackers were randomly being thrown
