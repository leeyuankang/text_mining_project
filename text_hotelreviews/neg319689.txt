we were upgraded for our room but we felt that the upgrade wasn t memorable we were put in the newer wing of the hotel so it lacked any character and we didn t think that the room was any bigger or better than the standard room which we had booked despite having booked the room many months in advance i felt that we were maybe moved for the convenience of other guests who were attending a wedding reception at the hotel on the same night as our stay the room was perfectly adequate but did not represent anything special after being told we were upgraded we were staying for our wedding anniversary so i did not want to raise a fuss in case it spoiled the weekend for us
