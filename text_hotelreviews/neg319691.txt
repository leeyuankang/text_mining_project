the room was very average nothing special and no more than a plain vanilla hotel you would find at an airport hotel very disappointing for the price you are paying for the foyer and architecture of the hotel from the outside at check in no one offered to help with my bags and when my wife tried to get in the room as she had arrived after me they kept her waiting for minutes because their check in system showed another room etc overall it was underwhelming entirely and given they were told it was my birthday weekend in advance and other guests were booked in and joining us they made no effort to acknowledge or otherwise i get the impression they don t bother much with booking com clients even if you are paying a night booking a couple of months ahead
