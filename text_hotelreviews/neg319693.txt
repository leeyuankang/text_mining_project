fairly standard four star room bathroom was very small and the shower definitely not five star i have a better shower head at home mould and sealant missing the bed was comfy and plain not dressed as you would expect for a five star hotel the window was tiny so when they said limited view on checkin they weren t kiddin didnt like the hidden service charges although they were small it just seemed mean to charge for a glass of water offered at reception we stayed in the modern part which is like every other hotel around if you want to see the fancy bit you have to book the suites this hotel is overrated i ve stayed at much better hotels
