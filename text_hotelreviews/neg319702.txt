we arrived to be asked for deposit to be taken at the point of checking in i have never had this asked beforehand by other hotels i have stayed in london i understand there is a need to register a card should you make purchases however unacceptable to charge a customer before even spending anything also there was no do not disturb signs to put out for the cleaner and consequently we were woken up despite having booked a luxury room we didn t see any signs of real luxury i felt like we could of stayed in a premier inn which would have been cheaper and had the same facilities the only thing that looked luxurious was the outside of the hotel as you walk towards it definitely not worth the money i wouldn t stay here again
