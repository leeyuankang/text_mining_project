we requested early entry to room which was not possible that was ok but we couldn t even get in at the time our booking started we were kept waiting another minutes and only when i asked again at reception were we told the room was just about ready the room was booked from so if we didn t get this then contract terms are broken and a partial refund should be given the room was fine but was a disabled room we are not disabled this means lower wash basin and i am tall a fairly minor point but we should have been asked if a disabled room was acceptable beforehand
