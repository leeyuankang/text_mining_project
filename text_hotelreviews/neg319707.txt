communication with the hotel is difficult only front desk was helping us my personal experience is regarding my wedding photo shooting in the hotel weeks before my arrival when i can cancel the booking if the hotel don t allow hotel email said it s permitted and only a form need to be filled i did send back the form then no reply from hotel one day before photo shooting day hotel front desk said formal permission is needed i resent the email immediately on the day of photo shooting email replied fee needed no cheap after talking with front desk permission given when we changed to outside and wanted to take some photos of the hotel building security stopped us said permission needed again we asked him to talk to his colleague in the front desk after wasting our best timing of sunlight security came back and said ok
