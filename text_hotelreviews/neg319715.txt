this hotel is a marriott hotel and the event team service was terrible we booked this hotel weeks before arrival and sent email request permission to allow me to take personal wedding photo in the hotel the grand stair is a place with unlimited possibilities for great pictures the answer is yes and we just need to fill a form there was nothing regarding charge and fee we thought this is for sort of registration purpose then happily replied the form and didn t consider another hotel anymore and there is no email from the hotel at the night before our photo shooting after asking front desk for the details front desk told us that we need a formal permission from event team we have to send email the form to request permission again in the second day we finally have an email reply from event team telling us now the photo shooting is chargeable however after arguing with front desk the hotel allows us to take photos after we taking photo at the grand stair we went out for photo elsewhere in the city and come back to take the photo of the outside of the hotel building with the perfect sunset right on the clock tower security suddenly stopped us from taking photo due to permission is required we explained that the front desk already gave us the permission and the security keep stopping us we insist the security need to talk to his colleague inside and finally he did he came back and said he would keep one eye closed and keep talking his own version of story we didn t argue for more because the sun is going down and the sunlight is changing every second at the end we couldn t get any nice picture of sunlight on the clock tower because we were stopped by the security at the best timing i have booked rooms with st pancras renaissance hotel for photo shooting and requested weeks before if the hotel told me it s chargeable or reject my request i can at least try other hotels
