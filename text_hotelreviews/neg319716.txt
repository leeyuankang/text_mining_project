compared to other star luxury hotels at this price i found the room very small it was a very clean and modern room and fine for a single occupant but i think if two people were sharing it would feel a little cramped no bottle opener available to use for minibar beer the breakfast was served in the large old booking office which was a lovely old fashioned room unfortunately the hot buffet items weren t particularly hot i d say they were slightly warm on my second morning i wasn t given any milk with my coffee and also there was no butter available for my toast it took a couple of minutes to actually find a member of staff to rectify both of these very minor issues staff were very friendly indeed
