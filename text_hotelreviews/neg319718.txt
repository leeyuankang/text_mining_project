for the high price i thought the room was a real let down it could have been any chain hotel on the inside nothing that justified the high price we were in the barlow wing which is the newer bit and had a great view of a wall bed extremely soft there was just no wow factor for the type of hotel it s supposed to be the route to the lifts for the room take you down a long hallway past the kitchen which absolutely stank everyday a mixture of fish bad drains and toilet and this continued onto the lifts so not pleasant at all
