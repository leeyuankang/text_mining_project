we were very impressed by the hotel until the fire alarm went off in the middle of the night these things are sometimes unavoidable however the lack of care was evident we dutifully got out of bed and walked down to the reception area this after all in our mind this was an incident there were no staff to direct us or inform us that it was a false alarm we were met by a chambermaid who rudely said it was not real we had walk down the stairs from the third floor and did not meet one member of staff returning to our room we were met by an other couple who were on their way down to reception i telephoned reception and was told that the manager would be informed it was two hours before i returned to sleep in the morning when checking out i relayed my story again and was told i should have received a letter and the manager would be informed what effect has informing the manager had this should not be the stock answer what always matters is the customer service these things can happen however it is how they are dealt with that is the real measure of service
