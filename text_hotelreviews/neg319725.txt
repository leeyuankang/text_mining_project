worn out dirty service sub par would not return to stay here again this is an expensive hotel yet in almost every detail from the furnishings to the food to the service this was at best a two star hotel a beautiful s building that could have had a wonderful hotel fitted inside instead it looked and felt like a cheap s hotel with bad design worn out furnishings and a menu of over priced and flavorless cafeteria style food the service levels were equally disappointing dated impersonal and careless walk by this wonderful old building even pop your head in to see the lobby but do not spoil your visit to london by staying here
