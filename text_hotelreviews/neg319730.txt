we spent over on our stay in a premier king room for our wedding night and it just wasn t worth the money despite us saying that we were on our honeymoon they gave us a disabled access room with red alarm pullies everywhere and no bath we didn t expect an upgrade but might have expected at least a bath for the amount we paid the room was fairly standard as of a chain hotel the food was great and room service lovely but the room just didn t match it
