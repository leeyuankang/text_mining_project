the only thing i was a bit disappointed with was the room one in the newer barlow wing pretty average for the price i was very grateful to be given a king room but i do think it was a pretty standard marriot room bathroom pretty small no bath but comfy bed for the price tag i think i thought it would feel a bit more special i have stayed in the j w marriott in beijing and so i think i was expecting something like that
