our room was rather boring and plain but it was in the annexe my sister and brother in law had arranged champagne and nibbles to be given to my husband as a birthday surprise when we checked in but no one knew anything it took me having to ask two reception staff to check and insisting that the champagne should be here before we were finally shown to a prepared table in the booking hall it seemed that food and beverage staff hadn t liaised with reception staff so we weren t on their screen just as well my sister had told me or it would have been spoiled no joined up communication then in this age of computers
