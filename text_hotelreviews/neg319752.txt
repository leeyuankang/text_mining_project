the seats in the booking office were low the consomm was wayyyyy to salty the pork cheek dish was wierd the king edward potatoes soup was dreadful like wallpaper paste wouldn t go back again wine by the glass was ridiculous even at london prices the view from our room was uninspiring we booked a twin but were given a double even though we checked in early so had to move rooms this hotel was on my bucket list but i found it a great disappointment
