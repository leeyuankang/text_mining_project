it seems that they tried to rip me off when i left presenting me with a vastly over complicated bill that was full of mysterious unwarranted charges when i challenged them to explain it they got into a fluster they issued me with a new bill that was much simpler and more in line with my expectations they also asked for the original nasty bill so they could tear it up i said no of course extremely disappointing obviously i will never come here again check your bill folks
