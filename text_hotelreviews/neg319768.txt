after breakfast when we were leaving one of the waiters came running after us to sign for breakfast even though we were checked in and signed in at the reception for breakfast as we came in it was part of the inclusive package when checking out we found that the waiter had charged us for breakfast if we didn t question this we would have been charged so the management of the breakfast process can improve and particularly as we were chased by the waiter it felt as we have done something wrong not a good experience to start the day wifi we couldn t at all log on to in the room on floor concierge staff at the desk weren t as warm friendly and welcoming we wanted a couple of glasses sent to us and the person didn t really want to be disturbed but pleasantly when we got to our room a few mintutes later two glasses were already there
