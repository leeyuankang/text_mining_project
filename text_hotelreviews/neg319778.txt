pool in basement is small first thing no one around so wouldn t swim on my own quite dark although with beautiful tiles it is mainly aimed at people having treatments in the spa on arrival check in desk tried to get us to upgrade an extra per night felt like quite a sales pitch the booking office restaurant has people coming in from station so it is quite drafty in some parts no biscuits in room if you worry about value for money don t stay here
