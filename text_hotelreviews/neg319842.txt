no swimming pool or spa working had to move room as wasn t happy with the quality or tiny dungeon like room was charged for mini bar for champagne which we never had moved room and was told initially we had to pay extra noise during the night which kept us awake and other guests also complained over the same issue moreover every time we called guests services they took over an hour each time to arrive very poor service and extortionate price for a travel lodge style room also paid another cash at check in for extras we never wanted this is not a star hotel and the service is shocking we would have rather stayed in travel lodge had better nights sleep on a canal boat in amsterdam would never ever stay again totally ruined my birthday not happy and will be making a formal complaint about our horrendous stay
