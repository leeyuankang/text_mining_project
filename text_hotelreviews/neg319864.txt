i would have expected free wi fi in the rooms in a prestige hotel it is even free on the bus very interesting room used for the breakfasts but try sitting in the chairs either the chairs were too low so offering no back support when eating or for the upright chairs there was no knee room because of the thick table top sorry but you did ask sorry but the breakfast were way below standard cold coffee and cooked food not much hotter also empty dishes not filled quickly even the budget chains do a better job
