i booked this hotel as a surprise for my partner on his birthday we had a great day in london and arrived at the hotel exhausted the noise from a wedding reception outside our room was ridiculously loud and we had absolutely no chance of getting any rest the manager offered us a room with two single beds which was hardly in keeping with the romantic weekend we had in mind although he arranged an alternative hotel i had to pay the difference in price and then had the hassle of getting back to st pancras the next day to get the train home
