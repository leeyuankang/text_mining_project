they charge you excessively for everything and i don t think the staff communicate with each other we spent a month travelling through europe and the uk and this was the only hotel that charged for wifi in the rooms motion detectors in the minibar meant we couldn t keep our babies milk cold then got charged to have some delivered to the room the worst part was at check in nightmare we booked and paid for our rooms months in advance but at check in they informed us they had given our twin room away to a large tour group who had decided to extend their stay thanks a lot it took about minutes to fix the problem missed our reservation at hawksmoor as a result after which our two parties were on seperate floors to add insult the new room only had a queen bed in it we booked singles so they had to arrange a pull out bed which they kindly informed us they wouldn t charge us extra for as if they would finally we had organised a late check out the night before due to our late flight out of heathrow so our bub could have her afternoon nap only to be told by the morning staff that the time given was wrong and we needed to check out an hour earlier all in all not a great experience with the reception staff
