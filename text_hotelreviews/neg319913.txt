i chose to stay at the st pancras renaissance as i had seen it featured on several social media accounts and it looked fantastic unfortunately i was left a little disappointed the hotel is in a magnificent building however my room was in the new section and the room was utterly generic not even a hint of character or any railway age decor i could have been in any hotel anywhere i did take a wander to the other side of the hotel to see the magnificent grand staircase which was wonderful but my section of the hotel both the corridors and rooms was woeful in its blandness i had a dog with me small dogs are allowed in the hotel and i was on the floor some considerable way down the corridor taking him out to do his ablutions was a massive round trip to the lift down to the ground floor out of the hotel all the way back not at all easy or convenient it was not at all well thought out but i was hot and tired and didn t want to start switching rooms i was surprised it wasn t more thought about by the person allocating the rooms i was also upset by a conversation with one of the staff who was explaining i couldn t eat in the restaurant with my dog i understand entirely the decision to make the restaurant unavailable to dogs but in a dog friendly hotel i was told i was only able to sit in my room to eat with my canine companion and she kept repeating health and safety it isn t a health and safety issue it is a choice made by the hotel which i understand
