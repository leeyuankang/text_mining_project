arrived mins after check in time but room wasn t ready took a further mins to be available i had an appointment which i was late for as a result of the delay at breakfast my daughter received half her breakfast other half was supposed to follow as the croissants were still in the oven but then changed to being unavailable and we were told we would not be charged but we were charged in full aside from the desk staff who did all they could to help the other staff do not appear focused on customer satisfaction and really let the hotel down a gratuity is also built into food drink bills which i can only assume has to be done as i wouldn t tip the restaurant staff voluntarily i stay in london regularly and would not recommend this hotel based on it staff
