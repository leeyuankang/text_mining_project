our room in the barlow wing was disappointing and was not in my view worth the price our room was indifferent and not what i would call star the room was just like many other indifferent hotel rooms anywhere in the world if i had understood what the barlow wing was i would not have booked this room but one in the main hotel very disappointed the buffet breakfast whilst good was overpriced and extra to the cost of the room
