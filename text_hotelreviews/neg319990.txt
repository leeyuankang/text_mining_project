booked a suite in the chambers wing for my wife s birthday and having made the booking i called to confirm that our room overlooked the station this was the only reason for booking here as she really wanted to stay in a room with a view of the trains the hotel confirmed that it did so of course you can imagine my surprise when we checked in and were shown to a room overlooking the main road the gentleman who showed us to our room was very apologetic so we followed him back to reception so he could try to find us the correct one he went off and got the rather rude duty manager was not so helpful but eventually they found a room albeit a smaller one than booked overlooking the station we were fine with this as the view was what was important to us not the size of the room on arriving at the new room he apologised again and offered my wife a complimentary bottle of champagne and some cookies for our daughter as an apology which i thought was very kind however minutes later we received a bottle of their cheapest white wine and nothing else now don t get me wrong a free bottle of wine is a free bottle of wine but why offer something more special if you can t follow through with it no doubt the miserable duty manager who couldn t care less about the whole situation stopped him sadly my gripes don t end here as the windows in the room were filthy to say the least which meant you could barely see through them to the station this defeating the whole object of staying there i could have accepted this more if they were all dirty but those over the public staircase right next to or room were spotless added to this a stone cold breakfast they did at least refund this and a big scratch down the side of our car which happened whilst parked using their per night valet service and frankly it was not a good experience
