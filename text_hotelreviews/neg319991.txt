on a previous visit last year we ate in the very expensive restaurant and i had a starter with croutons scattered and they almost broke my teeth they were so hard so please rethink the crouton situation apart from that i have no complaints and still have my teeth i mentioned this on my last visit and they said they would report back to the kitchen on that occasion when we stayed we thought they were slow with the puds so we mentioned it and they were brilliant and apolgized and did not charge us the set up is very impressive and the staff are very well trained and professional
