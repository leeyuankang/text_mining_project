having a charge for the internet in the room when we paid for the room just hassle to pay for it and for could they not just include it the bill said the full rate was i wouldn t expect to pay extra for internet if i had paid that the worst thing though was that we called operator to ask if we had breakfast included in our rate and they said no on our way out the lady running breakfast asked if we were joining so we asked her to check again and she found we had paid and were on her list if we hadn t asked again we would have gone out for breakfast and missed our included one that was really sloppy of them and annoying
