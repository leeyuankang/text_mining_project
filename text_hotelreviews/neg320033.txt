the fact we saw a mouse in the bar eating area the breakfast wasn t good stood for ages waiting for them to put fresh sausages and bacon out told the staff and was still waiting didnt acknowledge that the queue was long due to waiting for more food to be served was only scrambled egg no other choice need more toasters for customers and took too long to toast fresh glasses for cold drinks had to ask staff twice before someone put new ones there wasnt on the ball when the food was low to top it back up
