i was very disappointed with our room i booked this hotel as i loved the old building and the rooms on the website were all beautiful however we were in a standard bedroom that to me was very similar to a premier inn room but with different colours and a mini bar which was very expensive when we called down to reception to query this the lady said that only the suites are located in the old part of the hotel what a shame if i had known this i would not have booked this hotel especially as it was for my husbands birthday we were also disappointed by the spa one small plunge pool and one steam room with separate saunas not at all how the pictures on the website look
