sadly we were not booked into the historic part but into the modern block which could be any international hotel anywhere we were told we were being upgraded but still had separate beds when we had asked for a double there was no green tea no biscuits supplied which should be standard for a hotel like this the shower was dreadful in a bath which for our mobility issues we had asked for a separate shower you had to stand on the bath plug to be under the shower overall not good value for money
