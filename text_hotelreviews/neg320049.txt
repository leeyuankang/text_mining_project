breakfast left something to be desired we like hot coffee not luke warm plates not very hot in one case cold and don t like overcooked and streaky bacon need to sort out ordered items like fried eggs so that they arrive quickly and thus arev eaten at the same time as things from the buffet why do the eggs come in twos we have previously stayed at the st pancras premier inn at half the price where the breakfast was better dinner was good and the room equally as comfortable
