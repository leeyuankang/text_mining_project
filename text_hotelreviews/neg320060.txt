to get to the bedrooms you have to pass the staff entrance to the kitchen based on the language being used and at high volume gordon ramsey was working that night in the bedroom all was good unfortunately in the bathroom water would not drain from the handbasin due to a build up of hair and gunk in the plug hole had to clean it and the rain shower head in the ceiling shower was almost completely block with calc build up had to clean it not what you expect from a star hotel with matching prices
