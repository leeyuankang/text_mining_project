overpriced for what you get from the outside it looks amazing the room however is dated and basic small bathroom one piece of cotton wool available in the toiletry set the room nothing special at all there were no speakers provided which you get at the basic of hotels and the view was horrendous to stare out at a brick roof the drink options for tea and coffee were horrendous nothing special whatsoever the wifi is advertised as free however upon arrival i m told it has a charge unless you become a marriott rewards customers isn t that false advertising how this hotel can be classed as a hotel i don t know all i can say is don t be fooled by the amazing exterior and beautiful downstairs it s a basic hotel and i feel you get more from a room at a travelodge disappointment doesn t cover it
