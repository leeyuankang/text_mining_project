this beautiful hotel is let down by the staff we were in one of the junior chambers suites which are beautiful however on saturday night there was a wedding in the ballroom directly below our room i rang at about to ask how long it would go on for as you could hear loud music and feel heavy bass in our room i was told that it would go until midnight and that they would do the best to try and get it turned down a little the noise and vibrations did not go down but did cease at midnight upon check out the next morning i raised this as an issue after being asked the obligatory how was your stay question and i provided the feedback that perhaps next time if they are aware there is an event then they should warn the guests in around that room the response i received was quite offensive i was told that they had ensured their regular guests would not be affected by the noise however they were booked out so as a result we were stuck with a very noisy room because we were not a regular guest feedback to this staff member don t be so quick to judge a person for only staying one night in your hotel they may have been looking for a hotel for business use regular stay management should certainly consider giving this staff member some training on how to treat guests at a five star hotel british woman with long dark hair
