we were really disappointed as on our second night in the middle of the night our air conditioner unit broke and water started leaking through the ceiling there was so much water we didn t know if it was the people above us or where all the water was coming from in the middle of the night and from a dead sleep we called the staff to come up they came up and we were very cool about it and told them they could come back in the morning we helped them put towels on the floor didn t demand to be moved and gave them full access to our room both that night and then the next day the next day i was just shocked that the hotel didn t acknowledge what had happened didn t thank us for our understanding and even though we were woken up from a dead sleep they pretty much acted as thought nothing happened i then told a manager when we checked out a few days later i was surprised such a luxurious hotel had such a huge customer service miss he agreed and said he would get back to me with a follow up about my experience never heard from them just surprised that such a classy establishment didn t acknowledge a more than less ideal situation is anyway not even a hope everything is ok today
