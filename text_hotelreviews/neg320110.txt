i was fully aware of the room rate but considered it worth it for a special treat for my year old grandson for a pre christmas weekend treat however i took great exception at being charged for the two of us for a cooked breakfast which to be honest wasn t that great hot so much so that i decide to discuss with the duty manager which resulted in further disappointment he was very nonchalant with his couldn t care less attitude honestly speaking this is not a star hotel other than the prices they charge the room was very standard not what you would expect for almost per night the room was not that clean the carpets were heavily soiled even more so in the corridor there are far better hotels close by offering far better value service but i was offered an up grade for an extra now kind of them lol also a little surprised at checkout to find they had already taken payment on check in would have been nice for them to have informed me not really star standard practice all in all price isn t the issue so long as the so long as they deliver the expectation which they certainly didn t on this occasion
