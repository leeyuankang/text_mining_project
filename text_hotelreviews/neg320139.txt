unfortunately all of the magic of our previous stay here was taken away this time the hotel was much busier and the check in staff unhelpful and actually rude almost degrading at no stage do i expect to feel unworthy in a hotel that i have chosen above all others because of previous experience our bags were taken after struggling up the steps and through the doors only well inside the lobby they were placed on to an unattended luggage trolley and we then had to queue in order to check with the concierge that they would be sent directly to the room and the room number wasn t even known a serious of errors occurred after this initial experience that i m sure wouldn t have been noticeable had i not been left with such a sour feeling after check in
