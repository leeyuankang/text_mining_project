the room configuration was odd it was supposed to be a suite but was just one room and the sitting room part was in from of the bed and looked directly at the cupboard housing the aircon the bathroom was small and had no bath and the the shower sprayed directly onto the floor and the bottom of the bathroom door which was rotten and this room was really not to the standard i expected from a marriott
