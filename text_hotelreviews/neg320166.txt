the fact that i had booked a suite and was shown to a large bedroom instead but that was being sold to me as a suite was very disappointing room i think plus it was a view on the road when i had the feeling from the photos on my booking that i was getting a view on the platforms in a gorgeous suite this one was bland and noisy so i asked if there was any suite available that was looking onto the platforms so i was shown room which is a suite i e there was a sofa and a coffee table too and some space it is a very nice suite with some character and it was very quiet although i was told it would be noisy because of the live music in the booking office restaurant it was a far better looking room and at least i knew the music would stop at some point the traffic outside doesn t really and although i had to pay another for moving rooms it was worth it the other bad thing was that in the first and cheaper suite there were large complimentary bottles of water on each bedside table and some welcome truffles between moving rooms i went to the lounge to have a coffee and when i got into the suite room later there was no water or truffles and my luggage still hadn t been moved i thought i had given them plenty of time to do that so i called to ask about luggage water and truffles my luggage came within minutes but no water after calls and being finally given two little bottles of water i called again to get the same size bottles please as in the former cheaper room the girl said she would investigate but i never heard of her again and no bigger bottle was ever delivered we like to drink a lot of water at night and it was ridiculous to get those tiny bottles in a suite but i had to give up asking it was just ridiculous we are returning customers and i would have thought it was quite an easy task to go into the other room grab the bottles of water and bring it to us
