very small niggles being vegetarian there was a limited choice at breakfast as the mushrooms were tinned awful for a good hotel and the only eggs available were scrambled until i asked and then was provided with vegetarian sausages and poached eggs which took so long my husband had finished his before i got mine i might as well have just stuck with the hash browns as the sausages were pretty much the same but a different shape other than that a carton of milk in the mini bar would have been better than the silly little milks supplied in the room needed to make cups of tea it also was disappointing not to be able to see the fabulous decoration of the hotel we only found out about the guided tour at weekends upon leaving maybe it should be mentioned to guests arriving for the weekend
