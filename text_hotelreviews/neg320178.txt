we found cockroaches in our room and on one night the room was not completely tidied up this is so disappointing for a star hotel we lodge a complaint and were given a discount on the night where the room was not tidied there were also alot of inconsistency on the feedback the staff provided us when we called guest services as toiletries and water were provided on some days and others not overall an utterly disappointing stay
