my daughter was with me and she managed to leave a jumper in the wardrobe of room as it was an expensive one she rang the hotel when she got home to ask if they could locate it they promised to check and ring her back she did not have a response so rang again and this time the receptionist was quite rude and abrupt with her and didn t appear that helpful needless to say she did not ring back so my daughter then gave up not good really and based on this issue we would not return back and in future would use the premiere inn next door
