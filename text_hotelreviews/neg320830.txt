firstly when we arrived at hotel l asked was the room ready by any chance and the receptionist just said no so l told her l did ask for early check in if possible because we had to be somewhere at two she was so rude with a firm answer no smiles what so ever she saidthat saturday is a very busy day the thing is l only asked a question and when we finally got in our room the smoke alarm was covered so we phoned down to reception straight away to have the plastic removed and we had to ask for key to balcony which l thought was strange
