when we arrived back in the evening the reception staff were surly and made us feel uncomfortable and worried as they questioned if we had a room booked even though we had checked in earlier that same day i think they had mis typed my surname but even so they could have been a little more polite and friendly breakfast was over priced for a self service facility location not brilliant if you are looking to do touristy things in the centre of london there is not far to walk mins to dlr station but then about mins train ride to get to tower gate and underground system
