there was only one hook in the bathroom which for a double room was a bit silly nowhere to hang towels although plenty of space on the wall for towel rails also all the lights were operated by one switch on only one side of the bed which was very annoying it would be much better if each person had control of their own side light the other annoying thing was that i would like to have been able to buy a decent coffee in the morning without having to take breakfast i asked at reception but that option wasn t available with no shops or restaurants in the area i thought this a bit remiss as ever the instant coffee available in the bedroom has no flavour same in any hotel
