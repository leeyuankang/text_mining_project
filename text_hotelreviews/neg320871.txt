the breakfast was poor quality and not the usual options usually available in hilton hotels this is a budget hilton in style lunch service was very slow however staff were fabulous and very helpful and the food when delivered was worth the wait terrible location if i stayed jete again a car is a must due to personal safety fears returning late at night on public transport
