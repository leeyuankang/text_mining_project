maybe a bit more of a selection for breakfast for people on a strict gluten free diet although gluten free bread was available it would have been nice to have had gluten free sausages hash browns and black pudding all these are easily and readily available from most food retail outlets and could be frozen so if someone has an intolerance to gluten they could let reception know to tell the chef to get out of the freezer the night before it was an expensive bacon egg beans and tomato only for me
