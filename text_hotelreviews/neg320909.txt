i couldn t sleep the first night because the aircon was very noisy and the thermostat don t seem to be that effective no fridge in the room what annoyed me the most was that i could have chosen the nearby aloft hotel which was a pound cheaper for my stay it was closer to the train station and also it is a much better more modern hotel with better facilities
