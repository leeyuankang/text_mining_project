for a really expensive room there was not so much as a bottle of water or fridge with drinks ok so there was a kettle and tea and coffee but nothing else i took two clients to the restaurant ordered and after about minutes enquired about the delay in service they has actually lost the order and we waited another hour in fact we arrived at and we were finally served at and this has the hilton name service was so bad the manager of the restaurant didn t charge us but i was very embarrassed
