the room service was very bad we requested bathrobes and slippers it took around an hour or so for it to be delivered and when the lady arrived she was pushing the items with force towards me and trying to step inside the room when i asked her not to she wasn t communicating and was very angry for some reason second thing we ordered bed and breakfast everything we got was dry hard and the eggs undercooked so we decided to try the pastries when we found a black piece of hair attacked to the chocolate croissant it seemed like all the food was a collection of previous servings to other rooms as nothing was fresh or clean when we were checking out i was explaining this to the receptionist who didn t take note and ignored my concerns that s why i m writing a review here i m very shocked about such service as doubletree used to be my number one pick
