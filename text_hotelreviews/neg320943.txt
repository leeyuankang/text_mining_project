we were very disappointed that there was no bottled still water in the room when we got there we looked for a mini bar but there wasn t one of those either when we arrived the receptionist gave us a complimentary warm cookie but we would have preferred a complimentary bottle of water as we had travelled for quite a few hours and went straight to our room and would have liked a drink of water also i d forgotten a nail file and most hotels have a complimentary nail file in the bathroom but the water was the most disappointing all rooms should have bottled water we think and most do we stay at a lot of hotels all over the country
