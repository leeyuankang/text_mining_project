i didn t like the fact that there was no shops close by they was all around mins walking distance which wasn t very good for me also the fact that i paid so much money and the room didn t look any thing like the pictures and the bath room looked damaged which wasn t very appealing i tried to call down to order food but nobody picked up the phone for around mins
