i stayed at the hilton as it was convenient and within close proximity to the arena i had booked a night stay with my husband to watch a boxing match after the fight my husband and i spent the remainder of the evening in the hotel bar it had a lovely ambience not long after our arrival a man arrived with friends and ordered a drink i did not know the gentleman myself but my husband and i spent the evening chatting to him i witnessed a very stereotypical attitude from one male bartender i thought he was rude and judgmental towards liverpudlians i myself was offended by the bartenders attitude as he assumed the gentleman was drunk when in fact he was not yes he was a little loud and honest in tone but not at all drunk the bartender later apologised aside to my husband i wonder if the bartender would have had the same attitude had the beatles walked in hmmm sad really
