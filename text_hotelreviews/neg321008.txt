the cooked breakfast was a good standard but unfortunately the hot plates weren t very efficient as the food was cold also the staff didn t clear tables at the end of breakfast you were surrounded by dirty dishes don t know why staff were not trained to clear tables as there were plenty of staff and in the main they were just replenishing stocks of crockery and cutlery
