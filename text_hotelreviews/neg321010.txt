good things were good this looks like a long list of horrors because i want to explain rubbish wifi hilton should be ashamed we re not honors members so had to access the regular free wifi not possible to work with it as it dropped out consistently aircon didn t work in our room so no temperature control they knew this before allocating the room we met the maintenance guy leaving our room and it wasn t mentioned we were there for three nights and had a radiator provided this worked fine and we did get a discount on the room as well as an offer for an upgrade but we had unpacked and had little time it would be nice to have a friendly face at breakfast there was no one cheery staff in general tried hard but got it mostly wrong just little things but inefficient parking was free in places so get in early the receptionist told us we couldn t pay for the ticket until when payment started w e were already in the exhibition it was also rubbish so frustrating
