staff were a bit of an issue on our stay this time after being in our room half an hour later a maintenance guy walked in the room assuming no one was in there we ordered some drinks to our room and the bottles came with no opener so luckily we had one and the phone rang around asking if our tv was fixed no idea what that was about also would recommend having more staff on reception at checking out time there was one staff member and we waiting about minutes just to hand our key card back
