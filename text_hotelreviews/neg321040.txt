the only downside was the walk across a car park to the dlr station which i wouldn t want to do alone at night and even as a couple it was a little creepy also we had read in many recent reviews on here that there was a water taxi right outside the hotel which we thought would be very useful but when we asked we were told there wasn t one so it appears to be no more
