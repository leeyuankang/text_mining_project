the only thing i didn t like was where the hotel was located due to the tube strike don t get me wrong the tube is minutes walk away from the hotel and we had to get the tube so far and then walk hour to kings cross as the traffic was really bad if it weren t for the tube strike then it s okay to get from that hotel to wherever you need to be but u do need to make a few train changes i understand the hotel can t control the tube strikes so if there isnt any all is great however if there is a tube strike it s not good for where the hotel is located
