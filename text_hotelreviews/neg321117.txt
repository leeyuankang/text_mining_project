we had been accused of smoking in the room with no evidence whatsoever manager nina had come up to let us know that we would not be upgraded to the suite as there was a marijuana smell coming from the room she was impolite and rude with a not bothered attitude i explained that if you smoke outside and walk into the hotel would you be able to smell anything she said yes she still insisted that we were smoking in the room and threatened that she would charge a cleaning fine for doing so we invited her in to look around for any evidence of smoking she refused to do so we asked the cleaners to come in and smell the room they confirmed they could not smell anything i am quite disgusted by her behaviour and to use her managerial position to say that she could have us removed from the hotel was a misuse of her position i wont be put off by this as i am a very regular customer but i hope nina has learnt how to conduct herself and speak to customers
