the hotel is not as good as other hiltons i have stayed in the room was small although it was a queen but big but you are in london so should not expect to much i was surprised to ask for mayonnaise and mustard with dinner in the restaurant and be brought the old used jar of mustard with a spoon and a plastic bottle of mayonnaise is this supposed to be chic or just lazy
