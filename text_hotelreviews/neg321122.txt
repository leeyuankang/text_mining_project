i was given a disabled room even though i had booked in advance and when i spoke to reception he told me they allocated me this room as the hotel was very busy i did not expect that response and told him i was very upset about the situation and he finally moved me to a normal room i feel that i was lied to in the first instance that the hotel was fully booked and also having paid what i did i don t expect this level of service very disappointing experience indeed and it did not help as i was exhibiting in the morning as i did not get proper rest
