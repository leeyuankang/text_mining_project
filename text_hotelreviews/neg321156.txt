it is too far from the downtown tourist stuff you get tired and are better off staying downtown to go rest in the middle of the day and go back out it is a minute ride to the sightseeing and back and since on the east side of town an hour and a half to heathrow airport when i booked it did not realize the distance back to heathrow remember the subways are loud and impossible with luggage during rush hour the above ground trains are quieter and decent sightseeing same ticket always see if your hotel has the fancy coach bus express to london heathrow or stay near paddington and take the minute express train to the airport with reserved seat always buy an oyster card to get around in london it is capped at the daily rate of pounds a bargain and starts over not till the next morning subways stop between and one am and you are left with night busses so be careful
