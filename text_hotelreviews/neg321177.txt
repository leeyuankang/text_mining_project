room service we ordered some food and when it arrived at the door i said to the lady hang on i ll go get my wallet to pay as my girlfriend was starkers in bed but she just came in anyway luckily with my other half under the covers probably just a miscommunication but not ideal best to keep an eye out for a space in the free car park as this is very small otherwise there is plenty of space in the pay and display car park horrendously overpried food on the menu for breakfast and room service
