reception staff are rude there is no personality to the reception area it s an extremely robotic process and if you want anything out of the tick box it seems like too much trouble we had to ask for our room to be cleaned on sunday even though we left the room cleaning required sign on the door and was out for over hours for the price i really wouldn t expect to have to ask for my room to be cleaned
