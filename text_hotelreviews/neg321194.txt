bedroom the air con did not work and the fan in the bathroom ran all night we stayed for nights as my son was competing in the london triathlon on the saturday we were looking forward to a nice relaxing meal in the dinning room on saturday night only to be told there was only a cold buffet for the triathletes that were competing on sunday there was no prior notice of the fact the normal menu would not be running and as a result we had to settle for a meal in the bar trying to eat off a coffee table not a great way for my son to relax
