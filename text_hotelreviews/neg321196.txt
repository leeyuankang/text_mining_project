the only thing i didn t like and that really affected my comfort was the inability to lower the room temp so that i could sleep it was too warm and i wasn t able to sleep well very annoying an employee came up early during my stay and showed me how to adjust the thermostat i still wasn t able to get the temp down to a comfortable level
