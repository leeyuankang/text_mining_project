other people had said that they had received a nice and friendly welcome and not as important as advertised a warm cookie upon arrival one of the receptionists left us standing there when she didn t appear to be doing anything the curtains were broken and would not open so we could not fully enjoy the nice view we had paid extra for the light was also broken on the mirror the room in general was not as comfortable or as good a standard as a four star hotel should be i have stayed in star hotels which have been much better
