very stressful when we arrived at the and asked the security person if he knew where the ramada hotel was he asked somebody else who told us to go back to canary wharf and its there we did get train back there and tried google maps to find ramada hotel only it kept coming up with the wrong name very confusing i then tried to contact ramada hotel but only had a voice recording informing me that customer services wasn t available to help i tried double tree number and was informed that this was now the new name we managed to get a taxi there in the end but even they didn t know where festoon way was and apparently that s changed name too to westgate unfortunately due to all of the confusion we arrived late to the concert at the it would have been a lot less stressful if as a customer i had been informed of changes as i am not from london
