parking spots are very very limited i d honestly rather pay a daily fee for parking and be guaranteed a spot than struggle to find a parking space on a daily basis most of the staff were very unfriendly in my opinion especially the ones that were at the front desk not welcoming at all and so after a couple of days i thought it best to avoid them altogether i didn t like the fact that one has to walk through a packed restaurant to get in and out of the gym the gym is actually really really tiny only about five or six equipment if i can remember correctly
