i booked a queen guest room which was advertised as the room was tiny and incredibly cramped the view from the window was of air conditioning units and industrial piping and to complete the truly awful experience my room was next to the main door to the corridor i have stayed in hundreds of hotel rooms and this was in the top of my worst experiences
