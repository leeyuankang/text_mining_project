six of us travelled for business purposes due to this purpose we booked twin guest rooms however of the rooms were actually double rooms on complaining of this one room was switched to a double room which was fine however our room we went downstairs to amend our room and were given our new keys hauling our suitcases with us the set of keys we were given were incorrect so we had to go back to reception and get another set again hauling suitcases around the gentleman behind reception didn t apologise and blamed the computer we then went to our new room with two twin beds the room was a disabled room so we had red string hanging everywhere and a seat in the shower with a very unappealing grimy shower curtain it was very inappropriate giving us a disabled room on a business trip especially when the twin rooms were booked well in advance later that evening we ordered some beer and a pizza to celebrate the closing of our business deal i specifically asked the gentleman who took my order to bring the beers straight up i even rang again to remind him as it was taking so long he then brought the pizza which was very undercooked and looked like a child had put it together which wasn t eaten due to the poor cooking and the beers that we no longer really wanted because we had waited so long on going down the breakfast in the morning at around breakfast was absolutely freezing paying for a breakfast that is ice cold was ridiculous also on getting a glass of apple juice i noticed that my glass had lots of dirt floating around in the bottom so was paid for basically a bite of bacon really really unhappy and absolutely furious at the overall experience i usually enjoy my stays at the hilton but definitely not this time we were not even asked if we could have any sort of discount the staff really just did not care
