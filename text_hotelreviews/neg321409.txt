parking i booked this because of the complimentary parking his was very important to us they had only a handful of free parking spaces and the rest were pay and display we spent an extra on parking something we hadn t budgeted for and i would like this to be refunded to me room service we called and called and no answer called reception and they said it was busy with no apology we had to go down to order it came but the bottles we ordered were not open and so we had to call for a bottle opener this took around to come by which time we had eaten our food and weren t really that bothered about the drink again no apology the pillows were very uncomfortable with it was very uncomfortable with it was too low couldn t get comfortable bed was also too hard the radiator in the bathroom was hanging off the wall
