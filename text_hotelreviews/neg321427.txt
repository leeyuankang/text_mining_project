the staff on reception are damn right rude the worst manager i have ever come across naveen extremely rude and struggled to communicate due to the fact his english wasn t good and didn t understand why he had taken a lump sum of money from our account when we were reassured it wouldn t be physically taken out and it the card was swiped just to reassure them the funds were there and for any room service if we chose to use it have stayed there for over four years and chose ramada docklands because the kids and myself loved the views from the rooms overlooking the dockland if language and communication was improved and maybe some basic training in customer service wouldn t don t go amiss
