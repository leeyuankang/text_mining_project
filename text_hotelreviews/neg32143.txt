nowhere on the description on your site does it mention that this room is in the basement and the only window is a small opening in the ceiling this opening leads up to a window which is at ground level on the outside an adult could easily fit through this window and drop down onto the bed and take whatever you ve left in the room it was really difficult to lock we used a coat hanger to reach the latch the safe that was in the wardrobe is not fixed to the wall and could be picked up and removed there was supposed to be a fridge in the room but we had to ask for this as well as the bathrobes this room is not big enough for adults as you would expect from the photo to get to the bathroom you have to pass the bottom of the double bed at the other end of the room and if someone is getting something from the wardrobe you can t pass unless they move out of the way it was a struggle when we all showered before going out the guy on the desk spoke good english but when challenged about the room he at first looked blank then said he would speak to his manager which he never did the room smelt of stale cigarettes every time we entered and there were cigarette burns in the carpet even though it was a no smoking room i would not book this room again
