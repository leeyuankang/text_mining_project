we had a twin room downstairs it was very clausaphobic with small windows beds very soft for us pillows thin too and when we requested new ones reception said they would bring some and never did fridge was broken warm so food we bought went off strong green light that flashed brightly all night holes in the wall where plugs should have been fire alarm had been removed which is dangerous loud macerater in the bathroom that made noise even when no water used or loo flushed
