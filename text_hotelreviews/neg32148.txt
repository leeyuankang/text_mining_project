i had a really bad experience i book this hotel because it has such a good rate but now i believe are fake i knew the hotel was next to the underground station but i didn t know it was next to a night club too all i wanted was to sleep rest and have a quite night but the music from the club didn t stop till am the internet connection wasn t working properly the room was super hot thecwater from the shower came out not a big problem this but to make it noticed ac didn t works and duvets at this period of the yr the receptionist at that night shift didn t care about my demands of help for none of the reasons mentioned before so i can t say i had a pleasant stay i m super disappointed on booking for the rate of this hotel i start thinking are fake and now is just about selling what they want
