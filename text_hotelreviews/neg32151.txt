it didn t feel safe my door did not lock from the inside and the fire door at the bottom of the stairs right below my room was open most of the time i reported it twice this made me feel very unsafe because of the possibility of fires and because the hotel is down a dirty lane and anyone could have walked in off a very busy street and upstairs to the bedrooms the door is off to the side and reception can t see who s going in or out when i reported it as open twice they didn t even realise that it was i also asked for a quiet room as i am a very light sleeper and was put in a room right at the front with a train line running right up the side of it and another lane at the side of it where people from bars etc come out to smoke till very late at night so there was a lot of shouting i didn t sleep at all as the air conditioning was either very cold or off and i couldn t open the window because of the noise outside i complained in the morning and the receptionist said some one would be in touch nothing yet that is probably why there were a lot of people at reception asking to change rooms or checking in and checking out straight away
