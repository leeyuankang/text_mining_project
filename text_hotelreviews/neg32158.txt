our room had no windows basement the bathroom had a very unpleasant smell and you could not put any paper down the toilet not what you expect in a uk hotel you are charged to book in early when we returned in the evening the barman had to be told by the receptionist to serve us rather than continue to do whatever he was doing and ignoring us another guest warned us as he was leaving to make sure that we didn t get a room on the left hand side of the building as the noise from the railway was very loud
