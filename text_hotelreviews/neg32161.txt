not very clean carpets stained dirty coffee cups dusty tiny sink bathroom most certainly needs redecorating mould on sealant and just a little shabby although the bed was comfortable room temp was too high and the regulating unit didn t work couldn t keep the window open because of noise also they charge you just to keep your luggage in the front of the hotel which i thought was a little extreme and not mentioned on the booking information overall not as nice as the pictures and could do with a facelift but for a london hotel probably one of the better ones i have stayed in i got a discounted rate on the room would not pay full price not worth it
