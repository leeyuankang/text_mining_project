room extremely hot as it was in the top of the building air conditioning only worked for minutes then switched off very poor sleep window opened but noise from street made for disturbed nights lower levels of building were very cool so this room got all of the upward heat from the building could help if the window opened outwards from the bottom rather than the top to permit the hot air to escape upwards
