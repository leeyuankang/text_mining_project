room was freezing ineffective heating despite the small size of the room i woke up in the morning to find no hot water in the shower staff came in to have a look then disappeared for half an hour i had no clue what was happening wasn t informed what was going on had to ring reception again which is when i was told that the boiler was broken they where waiting for an engineer and it wasn t their fault after having a quick dreadful cold shower as i had to leave i went down to check out no apologies as if nothing had happened i was only asked if i need an invoice or a receipt i complained they asked me for my contact details for the manager to get in touch with me never heard from any manager or anyone whatsoever i understand faults like this can happen but their response was absolutely unprofessional
