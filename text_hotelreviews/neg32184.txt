no day light coming in at all room was i was coming from a months stay in a south asia and needed a quiet place to stay for days to readjust from jet lag before getting back to work well that was the worse place i could have been from to i was subject to walls literally shaking all day as i was trying to sleep by doors violently slamming i could hear the staff coming back and force and talk like i was in a same room horrible feeling i understand most guests don t stay in their room all day but the facilities being quite small you would never expect that level of noise and my room room being the first next to a main door and front office doesn t help
