the toilet makes a really loud noise when flushed didn t sound healthy and also didn t flush very well the drainage was also very slow in basin and shower not sure whether any of this was due to being in the basement we could hear a lot of noise from the guests above sounded as though they were storming around at in the morning which woke us up so not well soundproofed
