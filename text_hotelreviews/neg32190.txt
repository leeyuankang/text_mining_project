i arrived very late and extremely exhausted after a very long drive and writing this review a couple of days later so it s not reflecting my tiredness that evening i was shown my room and really hope that room was the worst in the place double bed filling the entire room a kind of platform taking up space a blackened out window to a kind of yard from where there was a constant humming noise from some machinery as well as a bad draft and smell extremely poor sound insulation thin walls could hear exactly what was going on in the adjacent rooms plus when the toilet s were being flushed you couldn t access the bathroom without sliding around the bathroom door and then closing it after entering tiny i weigh kg so not due to my size i was charged extra for my cat which was admittedly on their terms and conditions which staff showed me when i complained about it not the amount however but not on the booking com website no breakfast is served teabags and kettle in the room over priced and grossly over rated the photos look lovely on the site and perhaps i was just given a bad room no idea was just a very bad experience and an expensive one at that cost me around which i deeply regret spending didn t want wild luxury just a decent size room and no noise or draft
