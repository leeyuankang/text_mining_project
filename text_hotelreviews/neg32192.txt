before arriving at the hotel i checked the pictures on their website and the rooms were made to appear bigger on the pictures i even requested to have a decent sized room in my booking but did not get this on arrival the toilet was literally like a box and we could not sit comfortably on the toilet seat my partner actually hurt himself on the toilet seat as it was very close to the edge of the wall and this actually scratched his skin
