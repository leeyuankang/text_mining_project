i stayed in a twin room that literally had the smallest beds just and i am sure the requirement for an adult is wide and no window they should just make this room a single if it is considered too small for two adult size beds there is a fake window but when you look out you are looking at a sort of air vent which certainly needs cleaning up we chose this for the location close to olympia and on the website they advertise bathrobes and ipod dock neither were in the room it actually didn t bother us particularly as we were working but you shouldn t have to ask for things that are supposed to be included
