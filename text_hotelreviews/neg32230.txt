room was very very small no ipod docking station as advertised bed pushed up against the wall and door to outside rather than window was frosted so no real light coming in not enough room really to sit at the desk without having tv right in your face and back of chair up against the bed not a good environment for working i went to a restaurant instead access via what looks like a locked gate down a wide alley is a bit off putting but nicely finished inside
