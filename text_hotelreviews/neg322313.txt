we have stayed at the guesthouse a few times in the past years this year we booked a room for nights but unfortunately upon arrival one of our family members has fallen ill and we decided to leave after the first night we told them from the start of the happening and if they could understand us and at least not charge us for the night no there was no understading but rude and stubborn responses that is not how you treat your regular customers
