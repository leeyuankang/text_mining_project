the hotel was very keen to get feedback on how we were getting on so much so that we had staff knocking on our door in the middle of the afternoon each day to see if everything was alright or to fill up the coffee machine with fresh coffee beans this was well after the room servicing in the morning and was annoying in that it always seemed to coincide with my wife s shower this is a minor issue only and could be easily rectified by the hotel management other than that the light switches were a little cryptic for turning off on
