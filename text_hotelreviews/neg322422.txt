no bad experience breakfast is available from the deli restaurant downstairs and it is great it is a popular and high quality place hence the price is reflective however when combined with your room rate it does become an expensive affair to sleep and eat as such would be worth looking at an inclusive or discounted breakfast offering would be a shame to see people do it once and then seek an alternative for the remainder of their stay granted you d expect people to explore and venture out but it s so good and so convenient to start your day everyday
