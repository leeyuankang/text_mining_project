the beds were two twins pushed together which was uncomfortable for my wife and i the rooms and furniture seemed like they were antiques which isn t necessarily a bad thing but just not to my particular taste i always feel as though i should be very careful with antique looking furniture and it s always more stiff than more contemporary furnishings
