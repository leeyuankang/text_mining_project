when i fluffed my pillow an old contact lens belonging to someone else fell out of the pillow i thought that was very unsanitary and disgusting i requested for the sheets and pillows to be changed immediately to be fair they complied right away also hotel is not deserving of four stars it s old dusty i could see the dust on all the surfaces like the shelves and the desk and dark housekeeping at this hotel is clearly not done well
