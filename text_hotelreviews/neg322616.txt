a room that i was booked was presented at booking com as much more spacious and comfortable in reality i have obtained a much smaller and less comfortable room which was poorly equipped not even similar to the one presented in pictures also it was far below as it was advertised it is not fair policy tomorrow evening after my first night there i noticed that the staff missed to clean the room even no basic service was done
