the payment system although the money was never taken twice i had a full payment and a pending transaction in one go i wasn t best pleased about this arranged for a late checkout for only to be rung at am asking why we hadn t checked out the soundproofing within the hotel could be better as i could hear guests all day that wasn t a problem and had some noisy neighbours in the night this was although not the fault of the hotel people were loud the noise from work being done above us all day was a little annoying as we had not been informed about this
