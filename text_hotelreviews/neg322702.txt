the bed surrounds were worn and tatty the tv didn t work there were no items in the mini bar not even soft drinks or water no air con only a fan so room was very hot considering it was degrees and too noisy to have the window open all night as it was right next to a busy main road this certainly wasn t a four star hotel if you re looking for an excellent hotel to stay at in vienna then go to the best western kaiserhof now that is a four star quality hotel and you will not be disappointed
