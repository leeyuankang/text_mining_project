the hotel is not stars just about stars the first night our room was not available we arrived late and clearly the room had been given to someone else the staff was very rude about the situation and not at all helpful the room we had that night was right by the entrance reception overlooking a main road so was very noisy we were moved the next morning to a better room which was clean basic but had no comforts such as tea coffee facilities the bathroom shower floor was not tiled at all so had to shower in flip flops we asked to speak to a manager about our first night and was told the manager only showed up around for an hour we waited and the manager did not appear overall this hotel is fine if you want something basic cheaper than central amsterdam but still walkable into the city centre the local area bars restaurants park etc make it a much better choice
