just to leave a short review of the place during check in the lobby assistant did not get up and handled most of the conversation from her seat meters away from me before finally coming to enter me into the system i took a lower floor on the staff s recommendation for better internet it was still very slow and disconnected often i paid an extra amount for a later checkout because of an afternoon meeting and in sequence the cleaning staff cleaning staff manager and hotel lobby assistant asked me to check out because they did not know despite me repeatedly telling each of them the room wasn t fit for a star hotel how did this place get stars in short this is not the hotel you re looking for
