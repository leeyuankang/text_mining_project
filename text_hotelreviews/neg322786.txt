i requested and reserved a room with beds but was given a room with bed having just been released from hospital i was not up to arguing by the time my husband joined me the next day there were no other rooms available the wi fi wasn t working for most of our stay the room was constantly very warm and by the day the air conditioning in the entire hotel quit working the windows were locked with a key a safety hazard and the front desk was reluctant to unlock them they did finally agree and the room was more tolerable after that i was not given any paperwork itemized bill when i checked out and have requested one by email twice i still have not received it my stay should be covered by travel insurance because of a health emergency but without the billing statement i don t think they will reimburse me for the room or for the mediocre breakfasts we had the price was far more than the accommodations warranted i feel like i was robbed
