the air conditioning did nothing to cool the rooms which meant they were very hot when the weather was good we asked for a room with a double bed and got two single beds instead but were moved to a different room on the second day we also booked a single room which turned out to be a tiny loft room with poor lighting a slanted ceiling and exposed beams as well as a very bad bathroom with a concrete floor the cleaning could have been better we saw cobwebs in the corners and dust on surfaces
