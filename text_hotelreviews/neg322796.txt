the floor of my room was not very clean and there was a sort of vaguely unpleasant smell that came into the room now and then my room was otherwise fine but the family member traveling with me had to be moved twice before she was put into a room with functioning electricity and phone and she was still very cold all week despite trying to turn up the room temperature the wifi in my room was okay on my first couple of days but it became more and more spotty until i could not get connected by mid week and my traveling companion never did manage to get connected to it in her room in short it was sad that a staff that truly seems to want to create a pleasant stay for its guests has to work in a facility that is so poorly maintained my travel companion an older family member was unable to sleep until placed into a functioning room on her second night there and i need to try to purse a refund for at least her first night
