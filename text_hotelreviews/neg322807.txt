we wanted to stay two nights in amsterdam booked savoy as star hotel drop our luggage in the room and enjoyed amsterdam coming back the room was cold the heater was on but not working in the morning we were completely under cooled my wife is at the moment undergoing chemo in the netherlands and was looking forward in a few days away and this really did not help they wanted to offer us a different room but the damage was already made by them reading other reviews it seams we are not the only once complaining about cold rooms then the hotel has really an issue never the less you would thing the hotel would have the decency enough to refund you no management refuses it become even worse via our credit card they even charged us double and after phoning them they said they could not see it in there system and i should send them proof i don t understand this hotel at all they are in amsterdam at an ok location but they really mess up business in a big way
