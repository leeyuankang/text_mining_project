when we arrived our booking was not on their list and the staff member said they were full their internet was down so it looked like we were going to be stuck in the small lounge for the night although my booking had been confirmed by booking com weeks ago the hotel had no record of us i should have got suspicious when i had not received an e mail direct from the hotel after booking it was very worrying but after staff contacted the manager who was at a different hotel we were able to be accommodated don t ask me how if the hotel actually was full
