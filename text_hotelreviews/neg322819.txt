this hotel is rated as star but should be star or less terrible choice and i feel some part deceived as i paid somewhere north of eur for the night there i do not recommend this hotel here are some points my room was not clean or at least it felt and looked unclean there were coins on the floor when i arrived and they stayed there the whole trip towels in the bathroom had dirt spots on them they were also worn and torn the bathroom had a large window in the shower towards the street and beneath the window there was a rusty radiator it did not add to the hygiene level of the room lights were hanging loose on the fasteners above the bed i was just waiting to get them falling in my head the air condition unit started some loud drumming at decibels or could be even more in the mid night not able to sleep i complained but the hotel was fully booked and nothing the staff could do when the radiator finally got quiet i ensured it was off for the rest of the stay the bed was a foam rubber mattress far too soft for any regular sized kg weight man to sleep in there was not an option to ask for privacy as no placards signs were available to hang on the door no coffee or any beverages available in the room the tv had only regular tv broadcast stations in bad quality with bad pixels no cable or any hd broadcasting not that i would have enjoyed it in the soft foam mattress bed in the unclean room this hotel is rated as star but that is extremely overrated in my opinion should be closer to star or even less
