the room was clean but everything looked very very tired the carpet had visible stains and the washbasin had cracks in it the window wouldn t close properly and the light over the desk was leaning against a nearby shelf at night the smoke detector alerted reception of a smoke issue in my room they couldn t call me as we found out the phone in the room was not working so they had to open the door and wake me up after investigation the alarm appeared to have sent a false alarm and it was impossible to reset it the duty staff told me that everything was fine as he would disable the alarm hence i could go back to sleep and he asked me to reduce a little the temperature of the room heating as a precaution against what i had to expressly ask to change my room the following morning reception staff were not puzzled at all by the fact that i had two keys and even after learning of the problem of which they seemed to know nothing none of them thought of apologising for any inconveniences created
