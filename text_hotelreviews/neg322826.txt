apart from the reception area everything looked very tired our bedroom boasted two large windows which was nice but one set of curtains were beautifully ironed while the other set looked as though they had just come out of the washer and were extremely crumpled and creased the bathroom had a strange heater sitting on the windowsill which was very rusty the bedroom fridge bar was empty even though there was a price list in the room a bottle of water would have been very welcome
