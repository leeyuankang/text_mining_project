this could be a boutique hotel but it is so poor that it hardly deserves one star definitely not stars as listed the worst thing is the smoking althogh it is announced and postered a non smoking hotel and in the lift there is a warning of a euro penalty for smoking or using drugs in the rooms or public area the hotel smells of smoke mostly pot the room was smelly and our sheer luck was the good weather that enabled us to open the window especially at night during the day we were out and had to close the window the roof of the second floor next to our window serves as a smoking area and cigarette butts are all around what about the declared penalty the room itself was okay small it is amsterdam but convenient and quite clean but but why do the mangement dish out old much used towels some of which are thorn why they keep a broken waterfall type showerhead if the magnifying glass was stolen or broke down if not replacing it at least they should remove the bar holding that glass arriving to the room late at night revealed that light bulbs out of over the desk were burnt the single receptionist had no spare bulbs we managed did we have a choice but again but the aircondtioner had no gaz so instead of cooling the room over hot air was coming out of the vents and we had to shut it down in the morning we were promised that it will be fixed but it was not so we enjoyed another warm night can one imagine a hotel room with no information whatsoever about the services of the hotel what to do some tourism material besides a tiny note with one word in dutch and a drawing of non smoking there was nothing luckily on the telephone one could see the name of the hotel savoy otherwise one would not know in which hotel he she stays what a pity
