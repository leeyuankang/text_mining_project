chek in starts at we were there at and yet the room was not ready receptionist offered us to wait another minutes i had to re claim the room after minutes again because it becomes painful to wait for the room after hours of train we re given a room with a thick layer of dust on the nightstand and the phone dirty blankets also the sink was cracked and the water dripped on the floor through the hole in it one of the bed controls did not work as well it took me minutes of intense conversation with administrator to get aother room then another minutes till that room would be ready we moved to the other room only at another room was clean though nobody ever apologized and all that cost me and my friend euros for two days and one night the hotel has a star rating but to us it rather has just one star
