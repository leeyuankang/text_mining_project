we booked separate rooms at savoy hotel amsterdam costing around euros total and each room was infested with bed bugs we confronted the staff on the first of our two night stay and were ignored upon checkout we showed the staff dozens of bites on several members of our group the staff then took breakfast worth euro off of our bill awful service we will not be using this method of booking again and most certainly will not be staying at savoy hotel on our next visit
