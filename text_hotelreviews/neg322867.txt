when we arrived we was told we had to pay a deposit which we wasn t made aware of when we booked the customer service was pretty poor as we questioned why we had to pay this when we wasn t made aware and all we got told was every hotel in amsterdam charges it which isn t true as we stayed at easy hotel last year and wasn t charged this we had also booked a double bed and when we got into the room it was singles but the man on reception did move us also we paid for euros to have breakfast for mornings but when we come down in the morning there was no one in the restaurant so we was looking about for the breakfast as we was told they serve english breakfast but then we see stone cold boiled eggs beans with a thick skin on them where there been sitting there for hours some dried out scrambled egg and burnt bacon all left under some heater on the side there was also cereal and some fruit quite frankly i wasn t eating that or paying it looked disgusting so i got my money back wouldnt say this hotel is star
