we stayed in room and were woken up really early by housekeeping rummaging around in bags just outside our door us perhaps a little too early to be making a lot of noise on a sunday morning especially mothers day didn t like the fact we had to pay to leave our bags after check out as most reputable hotels i ve stayed at have done this for free the leaflet in our room stated per bag however the member of staff on reception tried to charge us per bag when he realised we had noticed he changed his mind and only charged us per bag instead just shows that they can charge what they want really
