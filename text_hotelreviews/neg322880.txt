this property is a fraud for the following reasons in reality this is zero star property while they advertise themselves with four stars health inspection should review this property as in mho it should be sanitised before use room they offered us is in the basement and it rather looks like some kind of interigation room in bed walt disney movie i am not sure how are they allowed to use name savoy but i guess no authority is controlling this overall i strongly recommend bench in the nearby park rather than stay in this facility
