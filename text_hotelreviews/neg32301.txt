unfortunately this was not a good hotel experience and i can make the best out of pretty much any situation we arrived at to be told our room was not ready as they were still cleaning it having stayed at many many hotels all over the world i have never been told that i can t check in at the room was downstairs in a basement small pretty claustrophobic toilet seat hanging off and problems with plumbing so there was a loud noise every time the toilet sink or shower was used reception tried to charge us to leave our bags there whilst we went shopping the next day would have had a lot more to say if we had paid full price
