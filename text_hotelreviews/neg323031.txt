although the hotel obviously meets certain standards the room was significantly smaller and not as comfortable as for example the conservatorium even though the prices are within the same ballgame service is good but not flawless the staff gave me the wrong key also the doors close at so no smoking after not being able to smoke was not a problem for me before at other hotels in this class
