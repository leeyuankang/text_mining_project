on arrival very long wait for rooms plus if you don t check they do not allocate the correct room as per your booking not flexible for late checkout but they at least allowed us to sit in the lounge upstairs till our car pickup arrived for the airport over rated executive lounge facilities requires to be upgraded and does not suit the standards nor the image of the hotel nor all the awards that are hanging on the wall better drink and food faculties need to be implemented and improved poor service but after lodging in a complaint it was corrected but need to provide for vegetarians and offer better drink facilities
