when booking for my year old son to come with us it wasn t clear that he would not automatically be provided with his own bed he was initially expected to share a single bed with one of us until management agreed to put up a roll away bed was a very disappointing start to a surprise weekend for my husband s birthday and this was not clear when booking through booking com this would make me wary using you again
