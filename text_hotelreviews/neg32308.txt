unfortunately myself and my daughter s room no was next to and below rooms used by the staff as service rooms throughout the night there was constant noise dragging of objects across the floor and even singing with clearly no consideration for guests we had a disturbed night before an important interview for my daughter i did not really think it was for us to get up and complain for this reason i would not use the hotel again
