it was late in the evening and i was very hungry and all the surrounding businesses had closed so i had no choice but to order room service i ordered a cheeseburger with fries saw the price was so i accepted that the food then gets to my room and there is a service fee of euros so i asked the gentleman if this was his tip and he responded with no sir this all goes to the hotel so i tipped him i paid for a small overcooked burger and fries paying for a service fee should go to the person giving you the service or at least half it s wrong to charge someone this much for a burger and fries no matter how much money a person may or may not have
