we requested a twin room and i was very disappointed that i had to send numerous emails to request this i cannot understand why there is the option to choose a twin when booking only when payment was taken that a response was received back stating that a twin could not be guaranteed surprised that car parking and use of the pool had to be paid for a small thing was that there was no free water in the hotel room the water from the tap is drinkable but if you wanted bottled you had to pay from the mini bar the location is a little further out from the city there are trams close by we actually got a train from the airport to rai and walked to the hotel it took about mins a local person showed us the way the local people are very friendly and helpful the hotel is more suitable to business than a holiday hotel very corporate in design
