there were food trays that were left in the hallway in all hours we were there the smell of the food would waft into our rooms and i hated it there was one pillow per bed unlike all the other hotels i ve been to where you had a choice between firm soft pillows the pillow was too big and uncomfortable to sleep on the tub in my room was dirty and i really enjoy my baths the internet is an absolute joke
