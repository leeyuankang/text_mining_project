first impression is extremely important to me we waited at least min before getting to check in no lines just that there was no staff willing to help everything cost extra in this hotel except for the low speed wifi off course going to the hotel gym euro breakfast euro per person per day although a very nice breakfast it is absolutely on a too high price point strange and confusing explanations to why they don t see in the system that i already included breakfast when booking and they wanted to charged it again luxury toiletries that is mentioned in the description was a bit of a disapointment just too much hassle double checking and extra charges for a hotel on this level
