a lot of hidden charges here for pool newspaper breakfast parking gym tax admin etc the usual also they insist on charging a night to your card for expenses this is never explained to you when you book in breach of contract they will not refund this for a week or so afterwards in the meantime they keep your money and earn interest on it your bank will charge you a flat fee for putting this charge through a percentage fee on top and will also rip you off on the exchange rate the result is that if you stay for days around will be taken out of your bank account you will then get about back about a week after you stay there maybe longer i still do not have mine back from last trip and will have to chase you will be out of pocket for the i have no idea why the okura have started doing this it is unnecessary and slightly rude it indicates that they do not trust you to not cause of damage a night the other star hotels in amsterdam do not do this if they persist with this practice i will stay at the waldorf instead
