poor staff communication at times i had booked a babysitter for and was told she would come ten minutes early i checked twice with the hotel to be sure she was booked and would come on time she actually arrived minutes later than expected and had been told by the hotel she was required for and had been asked to prepare for a old and old my children are and this was the hotels fault and not the babysitter as the wrong information had been given to her this was unacceptable to us as my husband and i were looking forward to a rare night out the hotel did not compensate us for their error either the cleaners were inconsistent at times especially when filling up the coffee pods tea and sugars and did not always remove dirty cups we even returned from an evening out to find they had failed to service our rooms which were still as they had been that morning and so i had to call them out at to clean massage was good but too short and very expensive i paid for minutes and got minutes as i was started seven minutes late and finished a couple of minutes early very expensive at euros very sweet waitress in the restaurant the one inspired by ciel bleu but poor service we waited minutes for our menus and a drink and there were long delays between courses they also removed our wine so we had to wait for them to come back to refill our glasses which sat empty frequently in the end we asked for a wine bucket and subsequently they made money as we drank the wine then ordered another bottle my husbands steak was overcooked and they removed his plate but left me with mine so i had to eat alone and when i had finished his food arrived and he had to eat alone which was very poor half of the cold meat starter tasted like lighter fluid while half was fine the waitress laughed and didn t understand when we mentioned it the cheese plate was poor the shop was closed
