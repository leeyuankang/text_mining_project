when we checked in they had given our room to someone else which meant we didn t get into our room until after i was told that my husband had already checked into the room even though he was standing beside me apparently they gave our room to someone with the same surname as us once we were in our room which was lovely we received a phone call each day which was for other people one about a dinner reservation and one about a treatment in the spa we hadn t booked either of these appointments all in all the overall impression of the okura was one of confusion
