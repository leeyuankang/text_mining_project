when i booked the room it said that this type of room will be on higher floor with excellent view at the time of check in the staff lied to me and told i am getting an upgrade and then gave a room over looking the roof of an adjacent building it is very expensive and i strongly do not recommend this hotel you can get much nicer hotels for less money
