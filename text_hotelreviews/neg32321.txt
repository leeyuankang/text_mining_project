i though there would be a wireless speaker or ipod dock in my room but there wasn t one i noticed the absence from my room though i didn t say anything about it just bear in mind that the room is small which is normal in london and you will find it difficult to store more than fully sized bags internet it is good however in some rooms the signal may be weak
