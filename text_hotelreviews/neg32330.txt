i requested for check in between pm i arrived at around and my room was not yet ready which was fine at the time i returned at pm and still my room was not ready i was told the maid was preparing it and that it would not be long in fact i believe i had just seen them going there which was a room on the ground floor when in fact i had requested an upper floor room apparently my upper floor room had no hot water so they had to put me on the ground level at around pm i was showed to my room which was a very very small standard double sitting at the edge of the bed my feet touched the door i was extremely upset and did not feel comfortable the receptionist who was with me at the time assured me he would try to sort it out and get back to me after he did not return i went to reception to find out what was being done finally i was given a room on the first floor that looked very much like what i had booked small but happy with more room to move and and more like the king size bed i wanted the receptionist did do what he could to help me and was quite friendly and patient am sure it was not all his doing it looked more like he had been told to offer me what i had been given hotel is definitely smaller in reality than they look in the picture
