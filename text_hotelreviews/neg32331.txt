bathroom tiled and very cold because lacked any heating being a small room underfloor heating could have been installed and would have transformed the room also water was never particularly hot cleaner always left room window wide open so we came back to a cold room every evening air con is being upgraded but ours wanted to blow out cold air rather than warm so reception had to provide us with an electric heater
