the room was tiny for the money paid i have stayed at hotels with bigger rooms for less and in better areas i was quite annoyed because i booked the early deal pay now for two nights instead of one i realised immediately and emailed for help i was more than happy to pay up front as i wanted this but i had made a mistake with days i was told i couldn t change it and get a refund for one night i find this unhelpful and irritating as i didn t change my mind nor was i being a nuisance i realised witching seconds and spoke to someone money making is clearly important to the hotel i can see why as having been there i would not go back
