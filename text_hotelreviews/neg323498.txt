we have selected this hotel because we came by car and it had underground parking it costs night the same as hotels in the city center during rush time uber costs to the main station and takes almost traffic by rush time i mean also saturday afternoon it is simply very poorly located for this reason we are not coming back also a la carte breakfast is nice but the restaurant is too small to serve all the guests it took us no joking almost to order and eat good we didn t travel for business
