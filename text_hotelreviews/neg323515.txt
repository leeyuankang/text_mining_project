the only thing is the location getting there from the airport with public transport we arrived late at night is not easy we used uber for euros the amstel station is min walk biking is minutes from center i would recommend this place for anyone who is re visiting amsterdam but not for anyone who is visiting for the first time a note to the housekeeping everyday we grabbed the coke from the mini bar and everyday they refilled one single bottle of coke if you see a guest is enjoying the coke why not fill the mini bar with more coke bottles just a thought
