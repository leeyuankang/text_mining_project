the hotel has a restaurant but has no other alternative restaurants in the neighborhood this limits the freedom of the guests at the hotel unfortunately the hotel restaurant which is reputedly good insists of reservation of tables even for the guests of the hotel which may be denied as it happened in our case inspite of a table request hours in advance the facility was denied claiming already booked we had to change our plans of the day to go out to the town specially for the dinner and another issue is the limited options for vegetarian guests only three items are available and yes the breakfast is not a buffet spread so options are limited here too
