perhaps a bit remote from the center but the city isn t very big so it didn t bother us much had an issue one morning at breakfast we ordered pancakes with maple syrup but what we got was dry when we asked about it the waiter didn t seem to care saying maybe they ran out of maple syrup without really checking it s not a big deal and it was the only negative experience we had at the hotel
