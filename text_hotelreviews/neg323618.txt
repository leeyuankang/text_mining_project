the staff was rude and also seemed unaware of most things they didnt know when restaurant was close the policy shows a eur chsrge but they charged me told me oh sorry the policy sheet will be updated someday but it costs more now meanwhile i was called twice to leave my room even after paying the charge communication is clearly a mess at this place also don t be fooled this location sucks
