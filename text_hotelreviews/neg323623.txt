as resident in the evening we couldn t eat in the restaurant because it was fully booked by non residents there were no other places to eat close by the bar menu and room service was very small the rooms were like sleeping in a garage because of the unfinished d cor bare concrete in a word it was depressing i would not recommend the hotel to friends
