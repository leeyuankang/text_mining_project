only a couple of minor things our key cards stopped working the second day and toothpaste wasn t available in the room only on request also our bed had been moved and was really off centre to the wall hangings and tv so seemed a bit odd when first entering the room but definitely no big complaints and all easily fixed without fuss i would like there to be a few better veggie dinner options for room service but what we did order was lovely
