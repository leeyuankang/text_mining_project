we had a double room booked however only had two single beds pushed together ended up falling down the middle in the first night and ended up sleeping in seperately beds for the rest of the holiday a shame when we were celebrating our engagement beds were comfy and it is such a lovely hotel and staff hence not marking it down on this it didn t affect our sleep at all just if i had one pick something
