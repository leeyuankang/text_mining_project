got woken up at on both mornings we were there with a knock on the door by the cleaner which was a bit early for our liking as we had been out late the night before she was very apologetic but then did exactly the same thing the following morning i would normally expect cleaners to wait until closer to checkout time to do their rounds location wise there didn t seem to be a whole lot to see or do around the area but as i said it is really easy to get to pretty much anywhere in amsterdam from amstel station
