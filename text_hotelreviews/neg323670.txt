we only got one room key so whenever my husband went out for a smoke i was left in the darkness you need the card for both floor access and light in the room there is only one elevator and it got stuck once so we were advised to take the stairs not much of a problem but my husband s injured leg was hurting and we had really heavy bags the location is okay but there are no grocery shops or caf s close by and the hotel restaurant is pricey if you re traveling on a budget so better grab something on the way back from the town
