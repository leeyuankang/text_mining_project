staff weren t very helpful on check in no directions were given to our room and the corridors aren t your average long straight corridors that are easily located when we found our room our luggage had just been dumped right in the doorway i had to ask where we had breakfast as no info was given on check in i just had a general feel that the staff either weren t very well trained or they aren t very happy in their job i am gluten intolerant and in the morning at breakfast the hostess didn t understand my requirements all i asked for was gluten free bread and in response got the bread is over there as if i was stupid we stayed in a hotel in shepherd s bush with the same star rating a few nights previously and in comparison for a similar price this hotel was slightly disappointing
