double room was smaller than our bedroom at home so upgraded to a king room air con didn t work on the night therefore having to have the window open and an alley down the side that was noisy all night mentioned to the lady behind the desk that we weren t happy with having no air con and she shrugged it off and said she knows how hot it was as she had to deal with the heat at reception not good customer service so we took it further hotel is definitely not sound proof either breakfast room is way too small a couple had to be turned away for half an hour due to there not being enough tables
