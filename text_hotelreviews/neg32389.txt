the room was a lot cheaper then it s price tag only one socket in the entire room holes in the furniture my king room which i paid a premium for was actually two single beds pushed and not secured together and the room was tiny even for a double no cooked breakfast options i felt like i was mislead and i could have got a lot more for my money elsewhere if i was charged half the price then i d consider it fair value for money
