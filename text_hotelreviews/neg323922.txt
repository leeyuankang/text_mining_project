bathroom very cramped with sliding door that didn t fit properly and had a big hole in it so not too much privacy too noisy outside to have the window open at night and ventilation inside the room not very effective on coolest setting i wouldn t have liked to be there on a very warm night in the summer major roadworks going on right outside bit of an eyesore one double duvet preferred on a double bed rather than two single ones
