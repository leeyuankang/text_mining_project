my room was on the ground floor and throughout my stay three nights there was an ominous looking vacuum cleaner parked next to my door most of the time on the second day i also found a bulky dirty laundry bag hanging on the door handle packed with what appeared to be towels and bed linens there was a message for you hanger attached which indicated that the bulky load had been left in response to a do not disturb sing on my door when i took the bag to the reception to ask what i was supposed to do with it i was told that the contents were for me to refresh myself i have never come across this do it yourself approach at any other hotel considering that there were two bathrooms in the room and plenty of towels and considering also that the hotel has an environment friendly policy of not using extra towels unnecessarily the purpose of the laundry bag which i carried back to my room after the staff member s explanation remains a mystery very odd
