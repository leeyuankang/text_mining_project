i have one small issue i was greeted by a very enthusiastic helpful nice young man on my arrival on tues evening indeed i rang my wife to tell her how nice he was however i was then dealt with by an unfriendly woman who i thought was quite disrespectful perhaps being irish a smile comes easy but with my chronic health problems it s difficult to see how this woman could have worse issues or couldn t scrape up a smile little bit of positivity other than that this property is a fantastic facility in a great location in a stunning city
