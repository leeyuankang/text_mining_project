unfortunately the corridor before our room smelled like a painter s studio in the sauna there was no dressing room and just three couchs and last but really worst the meals we consumed in the bar for lunch were merely the quality of a bad diner the meat burnt and the cheese of our burgers still cold really disgusting the chicken in our chicken salad was comparable to mcdonald s like it never had been a whole chicken not at all what one expects from a hotel like this moreover there was only one waitress in the bar at lunch time who obviously had to do all the cooking if you can call it like this for defrosted meals as they seemed and serving the guests
