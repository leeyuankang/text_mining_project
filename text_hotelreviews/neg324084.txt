the free wi fi was actually limited this was a big problem for me i would not have booked this hotel if i had known there were few english channels to compensate we tried to watch tv over the internet but due to low data the internet cut off within a couple of hours we stayed at numerous hotels in other european cities and this was a first the internet was flaky even when we had it the room was a little cold and we could not control the heat in the room not close enough to city center for me
