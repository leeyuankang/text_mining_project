not the best wifi solution same type of setup as in many places in australia new zealand ticket limit and session limit you need to login again all the time and get new codes annoying when watching netflix or getting cut out when making important skype calls wifi up is too slow for a premier class hotel i would have expected in a hotel like this especially in a big modern european city like vienna faster lan is available at a computer station close to the elevator on floor but i don t want to make calls there why is wifi always slower and worse the more expensive hotel you stay at it is the same all around the globe star hotels often have worse wifi than cheap hostels as a suggestion for future guests maybe you could offer a premium wifi solution for those who prioritize that however wifi was the only negative point i could find with this hotel so overall very pleased even if i write a lot of text here in the negative box
