a nice hotel but bedroom far too noisy all internal noise for me had tv from one side then the other then back to the first different guests then from above also had a lot of noise from the corridor most of this was down to the other guests readers please remember others may be trying to sleep when you re up but tv s fixed to the wall without any noise insulation that are closer to guests in a different room than those in bed watching it is down to the hotel a simple layer of rubber etc between the bracket and the wall would make so much difference everything else about the hotel was fine good good food good location out of the main area but very close etc but adequate sleep is by far the most important hence i won t stay there again until they have done something about this if resolved or i was not a light sleeper i would stay again
