not worth at all its rating on booking not a four stars hotel old building with shabby and quite old furniture dirty and old moquette in every room poor and not very clean floor in common spaces and stairs not a big bed but two single beds just unified but incredible with single blankets wich fell down during the night never seen before a double bed room with single blankets not single bottles of soap only big dispenser for shower and sink
