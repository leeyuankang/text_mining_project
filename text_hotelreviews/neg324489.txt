my review is only a ad it was close to the stadium i would rate the room out of the bathroom was terrible no where near value for money the shower was in tiny bath with a shower curtain when a shower screan is expected the shower pressure was best described as a dripping tap the bathroom door had a hole in it the basin had stains in it and the toilet paper holder would pop off eveytime it was used carpet and chairs in the room were stained and disgusting
