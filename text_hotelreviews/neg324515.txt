my booking did not indicate which of the two hotels my room was allocated more information regarding breakfast options prior to arrival for instance our room was based at the millennium hotel and when i came to add breakfast on check in i was not able to book a full buffet cooked breakfast and a continental breakfast as guests of bar restaurant the only option was x full cooked buffet breakfasts with breakfast invitation vouchers i do not see why a continental breakfast voucher can t be made available was alot for a yogurt small bowl of cereal tiny buffet crossiant and a small glass of juice
