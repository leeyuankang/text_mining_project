the staff at the fronrdesk was rude the only form of id they didn t ask me for upon check in was a urine sample good luck contacting the concierge he she was never there actually they were there once during my night stay and as soon as i started to ask i was he pointed at the main desk and dismissed me there is no place to hangout in the hotel the lobby has about three small couches in it very small and there is no bar there s a delta lounge like you re at the airport and just like being at the airport you re unsure who s allowed access to said club i did inquire with the front desk and again they were rude and dismissive the official restaurant that provides room service is across the street frankies and the good news is their waitstaff and bartenders are so miserable and rude they make the hotel frontdesk staff seem friendly
