we found food crumbs on the desk and blue greenish dried up soap scum on the bathroom tile so we were moved to another room and the staff didn t even bother to double check the room as we found little hairs on the corner of the bath tub and the bathroom tile when the housekeeper came to clean and when we told her she said to us it had nothing to do with her and that she was a night staff and to tell reception no apology from her that is not what you want to hear as a paying customer very disappointed she made us feel like we were being fussy room was cold at night no hotel booklet or guide in room mushrooms during breakfast time was not washed properly
