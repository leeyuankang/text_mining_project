the fact that i couldn t get a room size i expected i wendy back to this hotel having really enjoyed my last stay years ago only to fiend out the room type i can back to has been refurbished and now collapsed into a family room no drinks at the bar about disappointing i think they tried to reduced the rating for the hotel to starts with the basic facilities and services breakfast was a whopping not worth it as i don t eat pork expected to find vegetarian option
