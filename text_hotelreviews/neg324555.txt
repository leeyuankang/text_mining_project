although i never like to pick faults i felt let down given the fantastic check in the first floor had a slight foul smell when leaving lift bedding had lipstick or nail varnish on duvet on the inside tea stain down the side of my bed on wall bathroom floor wasnt clean and the drain under the toilet flooded in the morning brought these to attention when we checked out as we checked in quite late and was tired at the time kind of accepted a few minor things as was a great price however i think its a case of once you notice one thing its a downward spiral housekeeping definately needs a word aside all this was a great location and reasonable price
