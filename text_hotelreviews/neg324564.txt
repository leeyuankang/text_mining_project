the breakfast was not worth the meat tasted off and those eggs looked worse that cat food our heating wasnt working so we were provided with a fan heater which we obviously couldnt keep on all night as it got too hot so the night was cold apart from that the room was really nice and spaced out bed was comfy too but both me and my partner were very disappointed with the food it did not live up to the millenium hotel standard i m afraid
