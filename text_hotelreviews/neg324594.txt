stayed at the millennium hotel not the copthorne which i hadnt realised checked in at the copthorne and was basically ignored until i made it obvious i was annoyed then directed acrooss the road to the sister hotel the rooms heating would not work and the tv was temperamental the desk staff did sort that problem but didnt let her colleagues know breakfast at each surely should be served hot not lukewarm
