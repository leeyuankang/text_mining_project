staff spent a long time finding the booking well actually cancelled one booking and rebooked as not able to change directly but member of staff only looked into the surname and told us no valid booking available told him maybe check the order number instead but he said it s the customer id not booking reference though it says booking reference on page anyway spent a long time confiming the booking and young baby was quite annoyed waiting there
