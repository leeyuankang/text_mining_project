these are two separate hotels the millenium hotel that looks like a high standard hotel and the copthorne hotel that looks like its poor cousin when i made the room reservation the reservation read millenium and copthorne hotels it was never mentioned that i actually booked a room at the copthorne hotel on my arrival the receptionist at the millenium playfully told me you are at the right hotel but your room is in the other building copthorne hotel the difference between the two hotels is quite evident dated furniture broken shelf in the bathroom etc
