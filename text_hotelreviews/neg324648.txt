where do we start our upgraded rooms were very small i do not believe they were superior rooms i was charged twice for the rooms the checkin reception staff gave wrong info about not being charged and room types etc did not feel staff were dressed smart enough considering the clientel you have at the hotel the rooms were very dated and very basic i feel even a premier inn room is of a higher standard
