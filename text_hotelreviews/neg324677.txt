the marco pierre white restaurant on site was recommended it was grossly expensive over for two very poor steak meals i would not recommend it to anyone and i m sure mr white would not enjoy tough old boot leather posing as steak i also objected to an optional service charge being added without the waitress even asking me whether i wished for this or not
