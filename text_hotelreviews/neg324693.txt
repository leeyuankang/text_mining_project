very warm even with air con on beds hard but if it wasn t so warm you could probably sleep better expensive at match days and not worth what they charge at that time but if u get it at the normal rate it is well worth it also be careful if u book the room for someone else the card used to book had to be present at check in this is not clearly stated at time of booking you could be left standing with no toom beware and just to add breakfast is very expensive i thought per person
