really disappointed in the presentation of the food from room service considering the price it was only adequate i ve had a club sandwich at similar hotels that was mouth watering just to look at this burger was a small rather pathetic thing chips were cold and not enough and the condiments all came in packets like at wimpey they really could have put salt and pepper in silver pots and laid the tray out better i d have eaten better at mcdonalds nearby for a third of the price
