shower was the worst i have experienced in years of staying hotels having worked for the airlines for years and staying in numerous hotels on a regular basis it was absolutely shocking must be a water pressure issue in the bathrooms also minutes after arriving at the room i opened the mini bar to find a carrier bag full of mouldy biscuits and muffins
