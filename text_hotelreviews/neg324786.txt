i made three local phone calls from my room to administer restaurant table reservations etc for this the hotel charged an outragous rip off more the do not disturb sign had to be put up at all times outside the door unless you want the maid to pop in at all times most of the times she knocked at the door first but she also locked her self in without any warning even when we had a superior room there were no place to hang our coats and jackets there was only one rest chair the desk was very small and the wifi worked only half way during our stay the hotel is located in zone of the subway system and it is not possible to reach city centre without a change of trains all this making travel uneccessary complicated the frankie sportsbar serve lousy food and beer the restaurant marco bar and grill have great food and wine but it should be by it s price beer selection is also here very poor hotel is not recommended in any way
