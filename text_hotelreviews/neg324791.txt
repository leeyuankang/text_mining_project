rooms were quite drab and worn looking not what i would expect of a star property on arrival our room stank of stale smoke even though it was a non smoking room to be fair to the staff we were moved straight away to the next room up the corridor there was still slight smell of smoke but we left the window open while we were out to air the room and it was fine after that
