the phone in room was missing concierge brought up a new one not working either faulty line the breakfast was in the other hotel and you had to take a short walk outside to get breakfast which makes you feel you re in the annexe not the proper hotel where there is a bar etc if it rained you could go through the underground car park but this was a bit of an effort wish the bathroom had a stronger shower in room where my son stayed you couldn t control the water temperature and the shower was far too hot for the first days of the stay i paid for a superior room but i didn t think it was very superior it was quite ordinary looking not complaining but not what i had expected
