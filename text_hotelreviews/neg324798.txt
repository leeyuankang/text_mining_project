there isn t anywhere to get away from the noisy fans tried to talk to the person next to me and it was so difficult to hear each other it was impossible thats fair enough as it is a meeting place for fans of cfc went and found a room within the hotel which served coffee we sat down and ordered and then a member of staff started hoovering next to us not amused i think it is extremely overpriced room plus to park the car very expensive weekend
