finding the right place to park was challenging once we figured it out it was ok but we circled around twice after going in the wrong place the first time the correct entrance is to the left of the hourly parking entrance we had to run the water in the shower for minutes before it would get hot it didn t seem very secure we would ask for our key by room number and they didn t challenge us it makes us think that anyone could come in and ask for our room key and access our room while we are away it could be that they recognized us so i m not sure
