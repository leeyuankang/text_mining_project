accessibility to the property was a problem because of construction on the road you have to park outside the hotel and if you have a big van the nearest parking building cannot accommodate that the hotel does not have a restaurant but luckily excelsior across the mall had a restaurant and a gourmet food hall the single elevator is not sufficient to handle guest traffic more so during the breakfast hours
