our room was excruciatingly hot and when you turned the temp down it made no difference thank goodness our widow could open which we had to leave open all night it said in reviews that the hotel had been refurbished but we must have got an old room not star standards we asked for a taxi to be booked for next morning to catch our train but they diddnt do it the man on the counter in the morning was rude and not helpful i am a genius booker and have stayed in many places this i wouldn t recommend
