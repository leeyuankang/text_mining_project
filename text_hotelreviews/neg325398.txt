even though this was our third time in ambasciatori i will not come back to this hotel before a serious renovation is done i have booked a deluxe twin room and chosen to upgrade to a junior suite because the original deluxe room gave quite a bad impression it was smelly like toilet smelly worn out and smaller than i assumed it was now suite was quite nice newly renovated and spacious until the water started coming out of the bath tub and shower sinks that happened several times it looked to me like water starts coming out when some of the neighbours upstairs use the amenities i just hope it was from their tubs and not from their toilets finally the room service didn t have our first picks from the menu
