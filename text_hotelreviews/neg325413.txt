don t accept the special rate it s a shame the bedroom they are selling even if it s cheap it s not according to a stars i m used to travel for business in all europe but i never had a such situation where i haven t slept at all i could write a book on it but i only reccomend not to accept a special rate they are just exlpoiting an older side of the hotel which should renew but it s really unconfortable
