why is every staff in this hotel mean and awful especially the ones at the front desk yes you have successfully driven away any returning customers so you can continue to chat amongst each other wifi non existent i checked with the front desk staff and they couldn t care less if you don t have it just don t advertise you have it room size is rather big but tired and smells the aircon makes this squiggy sound all night and there is no way to turn it off funny light switches you can never figure out how to switch each one on or off and i am a seasoned traveler someone else said it already it s a hotel of floors with basement but only one lift is working the other lift has a rope blocking it forget about the breakfast feels like you are inmates
