we booked the hotel more than months in advance when we arrived staff told us that they didn t have our booked room because of building work and tried to relocate us to a different hotel in a much worse location further out from the centre it was obvious that the building works had been going on for some time if they really didn t have the promised room they should have contacted us and told us which would have given us the opportunity to rebook elsewhere this is presumably why they didn t do this but tried to fob us off with an inferior location i think this is very shady practice verging on fraud in my view after we went ballistic and created a scene in reception they suddenly found they did have a room that fitted the spec of our booking all along surprise surprise this kind of practice is why people hate hoteliers it really spoilt the experience of our first night and leaves a bad taste staff themselves were generally good but i ve rated as poor to reflect this bad treatment hotel itself is fine and in excellent very central but still quiet location i d have recommended strongly if they hadn t tried to trick me out of my booking
