the staff were surly and disinterested i was traveling with my daughter and mother who had her own room she didn t discover until turning in for the night that the bedside light did not work nor did the bathroom light also the shower handle had broken off so she couldn t take a shower when i told the person at the front desk he showed absolutely no interest in the problems also this hotel had the worst breakfast of any place we stayed in italy
