on the booking it stated an extra large double bed of cm the hotel doesn t have any rooms with a bed this size so the information on the booking is false i asked to speak to a manager about this and apparently the managers never work on the weekends a curious policy for the hospitality industry the receptionist who greeted us on our arrival was either having a bad day or is just plain unpleasant when we got off the lift to go to our room we were greeted by a number full bin bags and laundry bags i could understand at the end of the morning after the rooms have been cleared but at for bags to still be hanging around otherwise the room was large and well equipped but the decoration was out of date and some repairs are even needed not a great opinion of the hotel as result
