poor room quality dreary view of cigarette butt covered roof being lied to that it was four star when it was barely one star smoking on non smoking floor refusal to refund awful dark smelly room it was better to lose the cost of the night s accommodation than to stay there another minute it should be bulldozed while location is good in that it is near the duomo etc it is far better to stay somewhere a bit further away such as corso buenos aires we stayed at a real four star there and the comparison was so stark as to put the ambasciatori almost into the backpacker category at four star prices the positive reviews about this place must be either doubtful or dodgy there are so many better places and better value too beware
