the room was awful i wouldn t say it is a star hotel comparing to the others i ve stayed in milan in the middle of the night the nights i ve spent there they turned off the lights i wanted to go to the bathroom and had to use the lantern of my cell phone this was unacceptable i had to call the reception get properly dressed and stay awake waiting for the assistant to check what had happened i am not a tourist that loves to be in the middle of the crowd so the location was pretty messy for me and i had to enter the galleria with many homeless people sleeping on paper screaming in another language that was not good it is near the shops some restaurants and the duomo cathedral but i didn t like it
