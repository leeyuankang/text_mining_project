delux room we had was situated on the first floor and was very noisy it had dirty marks on the carpet one of the two elevators was out of order as a result of the malfunction you have to wait for five minutes at least for the working elevator and then get stuck going up and down for another minutes price of the room was highly overpriced for the experience we had
