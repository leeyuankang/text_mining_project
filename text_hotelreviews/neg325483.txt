one of the worst hotels i have stayed in horrible beds i paid for a king size bed but ended up with two twin beds installed closely together beds were incredibly uncomfortable rock hard mattress where you can feel the metal springs in your back i had to take a pillow and put it vertically under my body to be able to not feel the metal springs i ended up with back pain the next day despite booking an non smocking room the room smelled strongly of cigarettes it was overwhelming reception minimized the issue and said that it was the smell of the carpet someone clearly smoked for hours in the room and the smell was in the curtains and carpet i left the windows opened for hours but it didn t fix the issue i ended up sleeping near the window with the windows open as someone with minor lung issues it was very uncomfortable breathing in this room my windows were opened at all times staff was not friendly or helpful at all when i asked to change room due to the strong smell they don t seem to have been trained on how to deal with customers they were borderline rude drain in the bathroom sink was completely clogged the first day housekeeping had come clean the room that morning but didn t notice so i had to ask them to unclog it the second day shower pipe was broken so i had water splashing in my face while i was showering stingy with toilet and tissue paper when i checked in the tissue box had about papers left and there was half a roll of toilet paper in the room the plastic toilet flush was broken it was coming off the wall at every use and i had to put it back in dodgy area the galleria where the hotel is situated is filled with intoxicated homeless men my colleague and i walked out of the hotel at around to go to the restaurant across the street an intoxicated man followed us and was trying to speak to us incoherently we had to run into the restaurant to get away from him
