not a good destination for a weekend all nearby bars and restaurants are closed during weekend i asked for a room on top floor which staff kindly provided us however very low water pressure in bathroom made taking a shower cold and unpleasant the walk from metro bus stop to hotel can feel long in cold winter even if not so far
