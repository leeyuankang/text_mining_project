the breakfast was only average disappointing for the price of the stay no on site parking at all not even for minutes to drop off my luggage before taking my car to a public car park for the standard of the hotel good i think it was too expensive for the location about from the city centre the over bath shower was rather pathetic very low water pressure i would have preferred a proper shower cubicle and no bath
