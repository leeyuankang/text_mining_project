when we arrived the hotel reception informed us that they do not have a king size bed as we booked and if we pay extra they will upgrade our room but the main point is we made our booking month ago and you need to keep my room according to my booking in the normal hotels these kind of upgrades will done without any charge just because of that behaviour shows us how the hotel is looking to the customers and because of that reason i will never ever choose a crown plaza again
