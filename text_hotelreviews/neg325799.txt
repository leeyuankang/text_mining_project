two things i would like to emphasize during our stay the a c in our room didn t work and it was getting really suffocating and hot the complaint was registered and it was taken care in hrs hats off to mr fischer the floor manager and the location of the hotel is in a business centre and hence you don t get to see any hotels or restaurants nearby which is a negative point but good for business people work at vu medical centre and closer to schipol airport
