it was all great until upon check out when the front desk personnel tried to charge for an extra night no show claiming the original reservation had not been changed i showed them the email confirmation of the revised booking on my phone and they asked me to forward to them before they reluctantly took off the charge not the type of discussion you want to have when you have a flight to catch and it could have been easily avoided if they had mentioned the issue upon check in
