when we got there we were forced to pay pounds for extras we might have i did not agree with the fact that i had to pay in advance for services that i had not used and had no intention of using the alternative was to leave the money in cash which would only be returned after check out the credit card charge is only released after four days our room didn t have a mini bar nor air conditioning and we weren t able to fully open or close the windows the bathroom was a nightmare we had to wait almost ten minutes in between us to be able to use the toilet since it took ages for it to have enough water to flush again the lifts were incredibly slow and the stairs felt like they were falling apart beneath our feet
