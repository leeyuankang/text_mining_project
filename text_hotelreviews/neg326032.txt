very shabby and threadbare all over room had dirty doors and walls shabby furnishings a bed that had seen better days pillows that seemed to have half of the filling taken out at the prices they charge in my case you d think they d supply a minibar or at least tea and coffee making facility staff interrogation when entering the hotel bordered on rude i know this hotel from years ago they appear not to have done a thing to keep up its appearance since this is little more than a boarding house at hilton prices i would never stay at this hotel again nor would i recommend it to anyone
