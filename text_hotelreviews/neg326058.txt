the key was really hard to work in the door we struggled with it every time no one asked us to hand in the key each time we were leaving the hotel and so when we returned the porter followed us up the stairs on the way in asking who we were and where we were staying in front of other guests it felt like we were imposters being accused of something and he didn t say why he was asking it was only when we were asked for our key on the next trip out that we realised why it made us feel most unwelcome no one bothered to explain anything about breakfast either so we just went out instead i was disappointed that there were no tea and coffee facilities in the room
