i didn t like how there where no coffee or tea facilities in the rooms for the amount that you pay breakfast even just a continental breakfast was not included perhaps the small lounge areas could have complimentary basic tea and coffee facilities if they don t want to put any in the rooms stayed in over different hotels over weeks of our stay in england and durrants was the most expensive hotel that delivered the least amount
