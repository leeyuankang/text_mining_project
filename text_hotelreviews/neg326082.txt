so spent nights in at this property i had a small surgery on that day and while i was sleeping one of the stitches opened up and started to bleed after i arrive back home i check that i was charged for pounds extra i called back and their general manager said that he had given me a discount on the damages and charged me only pounds they have charged this amount without asking me i only discovered it weeks later on my credit card bill i don t know whether to get pissed over charging without calling or them estimating that their mattress costs pounds with the money you are paying to this hotel trust me you have much more options in london than this hotel
