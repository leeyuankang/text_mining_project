if you have a no phones rule in the dining room enforce it even if people are just texting quietly it rules the ambience i asked a member of staff to mention this to another guest and no action was taken so i had to do it myself and got the evils by the guest and the table next door to them have a rule or do not have a rule if you have it make it happen
