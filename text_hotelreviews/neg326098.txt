the reception staff were quite confusing at explaining issues around booking and credit card charges when you book through booking com the hotel does a pre charge which is equivalent to one night when you arrive they then charge you in full for your stay and then take another pre authorisation off you credit card this all seemed unnecessarily complicated and confusing and the reception staff did not explain this well at all furthermore its been almost a week and they have still not unblock my credit card from the initial pre authorisation the breakfast was also confusing if breakfast is included no one explains how it works there is no buffet but a full menu and you can actually choose as much or little off it as you want but this was not mentioned at all one can feel a little ripped off by this and it might make more sense to just choose a la carte instead
