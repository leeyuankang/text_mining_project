due to a mistake of the reception i was invoiced in a different currency and was charged a commission for the operation requested to cancel the operation and refund the amount the amount was refunded but i still had to pay high commissions due to the fx differences when asked for a refund because it was a mistake from the hotel reception they denied to support me ended up paying more due to their billing mistake
