not all rooms have renovated bathrooms we checked in and were assigned a room where the air conditioning was out of order the front desk apparently knew about this beforehand and nonetheless assigned this room to us fortunately we checked the a c before unpacking we were given two options stay in the room and count on the a c being fixed once the technicial arrived at the hotel premises on a saturday afternoon or move to another room problem was solved because we agreed to move to this other room which was not the same category as the one we booked we got the older bathroom and twin beds instead of the queen size however the rate was unchanged
