breakfast normally excellent service but this time they were just too slow but a bit stressy at the same time i had prepaid breakfast but didn t order a cooked breakfast because it took forever just to get my cereal and i just didn t have time to wait there was only one person on reception at checkout at prime check out time so i didn t have the chance to complain or ask for a refund it was an expensive cup of tea and bowl of cereal
