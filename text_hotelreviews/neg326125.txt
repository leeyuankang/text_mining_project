the day i got in had i booked directly with the hotel my rate would have been i paid via booking com n for following day so i was really very dissatisfied that i did not get the best rate through booking com how can you make sure this doesn t happen to future bookings now i am unsure i should use your services secondly at that rate i expected at least a kettle in the room with tea bags and cups i had to call up for one thirdly one part of the cupboard was very dusty and obviously missed every time it was vacumned and cleaned i didn t bother telling the staff since it would mean me waiting for them to come up
