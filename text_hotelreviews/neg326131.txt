we had not chosen the smallest category of available room but the room we were given was still cramped for a double even by london standards i can t imagine what the smaller ones would be like the bed was uncomfortable and the pillows unsupportive the hot water flow was inadequate to run a bath and very noisy whilst attempting to do so some aspects of the common areas are quaint and cosy and this might be a considered style choice on the part of the owners the same cannot be credibly argued in the case of the bedrooms if ours was representative of the hotel as a whole tired dated and indicative of lack of investment would be a fairer assessment
