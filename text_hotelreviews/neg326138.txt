i last stayed here about six years ago and was looking forward to my visit there were however disappointments the toilet seat was broken as was the towel heater no water or power shower water was at best tepid incomprehensively for a four star hotel there were no refreshments in the room no kettle tea or coffee when i raised this with a member of staff my query was brushed off in a very arrogant way i assume that the idea is to force guests to use the rather expensive room service however when i tried to do this there was no reply despite several attempts so i stayed thirsty i was told that my laundry could not be brought to my room but that i would have to collect it this despite several completely unoccupied members of staff standing idly in the ground floor corridors furniture and carpets are becoming shabby the hotel no longer merits its four star ranking
