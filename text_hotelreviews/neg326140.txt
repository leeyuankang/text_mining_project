only a small quibble and this will sound very ungrateful because i booked a single room at the last minute i was given an upgrade to a double room which was lovely but a little old fashioned and a wee bit tired though very comfy i prefer the refurbished classic room but it was sweet and generous of the hotel to give me this upgrade thank you
