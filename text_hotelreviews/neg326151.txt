we were woken in the night and couldn t sleep due to noise like a heavy dripping sound from overhead pipes when my husband went to reception at the night staff immediately gave us keys to another room which was appreciated although still inconvenient reception halved our room rate which was very good of them and much appreciated we took tea in a lounge area on saturday afternoon which was relaxing and if good quality however staff appeared flustered and to not be well managed on that day
