both the hotel and booking com need to be more transparent about the status of car parking available at this hotel availability is very low spaces in the mews to the rear and cannot be reserved if travelling to the hotel by car expect to spend some time searching local side streets for on street parking the majority of which is for permit holders only if i d known this at the time of booking i don t know if i would have selected durrants for our stay not a criticism of the hotel per se booking com need to be clearer about whether or not their bookings include breakfast by which i mean explicitly state the booking does not include it to just have no reference to it is not good enough sadly it s becoming more common for hotels to not include breakfast as standard and we knew to check with the hotel on our day of arrival and in the case of this location i highly recommend bill s on baker st as an alternative for breakfast and to durrants instruct your cleaners to be more attentive when cleaning your bathrooms i had to manually descale the shower head in order for it to work properly
