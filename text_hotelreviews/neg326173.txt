the room was the smallest we have ever stayed in we have been traveling for many years and always stay in star hotels this was by far the worst value for money we paid for a room where you had to have your bag on the floor beside the bed there was a very small table a tv which didn t work the heating was broken as was the air con unit there is no tea or coffee and the bathroom flooded i don t like to moan and tolerate many issues with hotels but this was not good value and i think i would have begrudged apart from the location also be aware of extortionate service charges i went to the bar for two drinks which came to and was charge for the privilege
