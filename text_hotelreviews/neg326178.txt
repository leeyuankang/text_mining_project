the hotel is not clean i was shown to an extremely small recently refurbished room the bath had not been cleaned as there were human hairs in the tub i complained and the receptionist reluctantly without apology moved me to another larger refurbished room this room was slightly better however i have taken pictures of the bathroom sink which was cracked and the grouting around it very dirty the carpet had large stains in a number of places and the bedcover also had a number of stains on it the walls were also marked nothing that a good clean would not remove my room was on the third floor facing the front and was really noisy very difficult to sleep there are no tea making facilities in the room and you are charged an absolute fortune for room service never again could not wait to leave i did want to leave as soon as i was shown the rooms but was told that i would still be charged for them great customer service i have stayed in many london hotels as i am a regular visitor and only chose this hotel for it s location i will stick to my regular hotels in future
