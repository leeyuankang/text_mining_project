the hotel frozen my money on the credit card for days this is unacceptable when i arrived and checkin they ask my credit card again and they frozen other pound so when i check out and went to pay because of the money frozen i didn t have enough credit available giving me a lot of trouble glad i had another card that was not business and i paid another reason of my unsatisfaction is that my first night drunk people staying in the room close by waking me up in the middle of night at by shutting doors and screaming for more than minutes the day after i complained but the hotel didn t do anything in these cases usually good hotel refund you a night or give you a discount very unprofessional
