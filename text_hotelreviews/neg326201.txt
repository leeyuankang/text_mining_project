saying that the front desk staff was rude would be too generous did not want to accept my uk driving licence as a piece of id because i was a foreigner i explained that being a foreigner who lives in the uk when i travel by train within the uk i don t carry my passport but she still refused to accept it my room didn t lock from the inside chain was broken and it had obviously been pried open at some point before my stay because there were clear marks on the door of having forced it open outdated rooms still using heavy bulky keys rather than access cards wallpaper falling off broken tiles in bathroom bedspreads and blankets instead of duvets lack of individual heating controls room was too hot all night bathroom window could not be closed the mattress was not particularly comfortable definitely not worth the price in a city like london where it s quite easy to move around using public transportation there is no need to put up with rude staff and outdated rooms
