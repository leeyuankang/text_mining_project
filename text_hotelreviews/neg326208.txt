at least too expensive for what it offered which besides location frankly wasn t very much the hotel is very dated and i don t mean in a quaint way it really could do with a major makeover i paid had no tea coffee making facilities no breakfast and a shower that either dribbled or poured depending where the settings were placed i failed to find a setting for spray overall very disappointed but at least as i left the hotel and headed for the underground a came across bills caf where i had an excellent breakfast for half the price the durrant would have expected
