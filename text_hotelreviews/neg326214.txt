the room i was in was unacceptably bad peeling wallpaper filthy sticky carpet and terrible bathroom with pink lino and awful plumbing no amount of fancy toiletries can cover the awfulness of it no amount of traditionalism can justify the bad quality of the furniture wardrobe door would shut and blocked view of tv from desk breakfast was overpriced and mediocre quality in old style british dining room all style but no substance even the discount booking genius price of was excessive for the terrible quality i wrote directly to the hotel to provide this feedback a week ago but no reply so obviously they don t care about customer service and are in for one shot visitors to be avoided
