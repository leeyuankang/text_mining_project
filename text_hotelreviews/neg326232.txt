the team lacked focus on service i asked for an iron and ironing board would have expected these items to be in a room anyway i was told i couldn t have it overnight and would need to call in the morning embarrassing having to open your door wearing pj s at no tea or coffee making facilities in the room you could purchase tea and coffee if required there was a house being renovated next door constant banging and drilling we wanted to rest for an hour before heading out again that was impossible the room was very small there was a wet patch on the carpet from the radiator general maintenance was poor would definitely not go back to this hotel it is no where near worth the money we paid i would have been hugely disappointed had i paid the going rate pound for two nights it wasn t worth the we paid stayed in a holiday inn express for our third night it was by far the most superior of the two at pound for the night obviously durrant hotel have an abundance of regular unsuspecting travellers therefore not expecting this feedback to be worth much to them hope it s worth it to the unsuspecting travellers of the future
