very poor value for money for a cramped room which felt more like a bedsit a pathetic shower and a postage stamp view of the sky if you pressed your head up against the window and craned your neck a complete rip off my complaint at check out was met with no more than empathy which is no consolation at all if you get room prepare yourself i will totally discount this hotel on future trips to london
