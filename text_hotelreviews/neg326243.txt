we were given a very small cramped room with a view of a wall from the window it was very claustrophobic and when i asked if we could change rooms i was told that since we had booked through booking com it was to be a standard room but i had actually received an upgrade to that room i hate to think what what we would have got without the upgrade i explained i always book through this means and have never been allocated such a room in this hotel we did get a change of room it was smaller again but you could at least see a bit of sky from that window
