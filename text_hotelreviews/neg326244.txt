our first room was quite small bathroom was grubby shower curtain stained bath mat had seen better days the bath was set quite high this wasn t acceptable as i was travelling with a companion who has knee problems i asked to be moved and was shown two rooms that were available neither perfect but better than the first no tea coffee in room ordered room service efficient but expensive no fridge and only one complimentary bottle of water for two guests
