when booking on booking com receiving the worst kind of double room no tea and coffee making facilities no bathrobes old aircon smell of cooking in the evening from the back of the hotel sloppy and casual attitude from staff and no free newspaper i understand the rate of almost gbp in the week with no breakfast or anything is considered a cheap rate to the hotel but is that a reason to dump me in one of the smallest double rooms in the back also to be told allegedly jokingly that the room i was in was a worse room than others also why would the owners not put tea coffee making facilities in each room after all even their star competitors do this this is the first hotel i have ever come across in the uk to do this its almost like the owners feel that all guests should pay the gbp for a cup of tea and they are living in the past or in the s someone needs to let the owners management know that the year is the hotel owners manager need a wake up call on what a customer expects as basics from such a hotel even the staff stated often that they had heard this all before but the owners management just wont listen shame as i and my company would certainly have given this hotel another chance if i had heard back yesterday after i had called to let them know my feelings sadly it seems they don t care
