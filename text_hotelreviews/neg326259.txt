it did state on their website that there were no tea making facilities in the rooms but i really missed that as i need a cup of tea first thing in the morning we ordered tea for two but it was over a bit steep for tea bags of milk and some hot water i didn t realise they had parking till i phoned beforehand to ask if there was any disabled parking they said i could park in their car park which was handy but when i got there they charged per day we went with it as we were there but there was a car park not far away that was per day they only have four spaces and there was never more than one taken at that s probably why you can t park a high car there as it goes under the building and is on a steep slope with a low roof
