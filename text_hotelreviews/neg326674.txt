the tub shower in our room was awkward to get in and out of the glass protruded in an awkward way requiring a bit of gymnastics hotel is in a great location but does require a tad more walking as it s just outside the ringstrasse a fantastic location for anyone with solid walking feet highly recommended also next to the nosh market which is ideal for grabbing breakfast it opens early as hotel breakfast was not included and was a bit pricey but very delicious
