the first room we were in was really disappointing i d booked the stay for my first wedding anniversary the furtniture was shabby with chips and scratches everywhere there were scratches and blotches on the walls scuffed carpet and the wallpaper was cheap and dated for and a room it wasn t acceptable i have never done so before but requested a change of room which the man at reception kindly and quickly sorted so we were switched to one of the much nicer updated rooms they later brought us complimentary champagne and patisserie from the bakery downstairs for our anniversary unfortunately at about we heard dripping and water was dripping rapidly through a light fitting i rang reception and they said someone would come to check the water then started coming through another light fitting and through a crack in the ceiling i had to put both bins underneath to catch the water there were no other rooms available so we couldn t be moved we just had to move the bed and put up with it we were given off our bill in the morning apparently it had happened in every room due to heavy rain but being from yorkshire i didn t think the rain was heavy enough to warrant every room leaking overall i was satisfied with the staff and the location was excellent but i d been really looking forward to this anniversary stay and no pun intended it was rather dampened by these issues i ve stayed in comparable hotels in london a lot and leaking ceiling aside i don t think it was worth the price tag
