only reason i wouldn t return to this hotel is location it s around walks to the main shopping area and its cab from the beach front where it s very buzzy down near the beach with loads of restaurants etc there isn t anywhere walking distance from the hotel we kept getting lost so ended up getting taxis everywhere next time i will stay along the beach front as you have a lot more around you won t need to get as many taxis
