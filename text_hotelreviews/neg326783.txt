the terrace was nice but was next to three solid walls to flats so no view so we didn t really use it most of the time you had to go down stairs from the pool to order a drink to then come back up again occasionally the staff would take your order would recommend re installing their pool bar or supply a phone to call down for drinks no information in the room about the hotel or what to do around barcelona which is disappointing for us new comers no dressing table so everything had to be done in the bathroom for a mirror no milk for tea please change the music every so often around the pool
