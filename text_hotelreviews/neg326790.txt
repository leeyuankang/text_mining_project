however the cleaning staff was terrible we had our room serviced twice during our stay the first time was ok the second the sheets were never changed they still had my make up on them they never gave us fresh cups it looked as though they just wiped or rinsed them out you could tell because there were still coffee remnants from the morning before in all the cups we had wine glasses that needed to be taken away and they were just left there they only refreshed some of the toiletries it was so obvious the little amount of effort that went into cleaning the room i was actually offended and insulted it also took all day our room wasn t cleaned till almost when i expressed my concern and ask for clean cups i wasn t once offered an apology just told they would bring them in the morning with a very rude and curt response
