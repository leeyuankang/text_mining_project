while the staff was very friendly receptive to questions and requests for help they made reservations for guell park and familia sagrada for which we were appreciative however the company with whom they deal was not known or listed with the park and we had to wait at least ten minutes for the tickets to be recognized for the cathedral a different staff member did not tell us that this agency doesn t offer the opportunity for an audioguide or guide and we couldn t access the second level closed to those with no specialized ticket this was extremely frustrating and disappointing otherwise they were sensitive to our needs our room was comfortable the cleaning staff very flexible and thorough we had a terrace which faced a another building so no real view members of our family spent time on the rooftop where a pool is situated and the bar on the ground level it s a clean hotel and located in a great neighborhood we recommend a stay an aside there was a taxi strike countrywide so we had to take the metro to the train session pulling suitcases each up and down stairs many people helped us out however on the escalator to the train station two young men who in retrospect were likely watching us helped us with our luggage while doing so they opened my purse and stole my new wallet which contained many euros and dollars thus they made a haul i wouldn t have been aware except a man yelled that i d been robbed unfortunately our timing was such that i couldn t report it to the police at the entrance of the line for train travel which was also frustrating and discouraging luckily my passport was in a zippered pouch as i had and have no other identification necessitating much hassle back home needing to reapply and replace much needed information
