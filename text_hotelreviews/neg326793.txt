first room was crap we opened the window and faced a wall we complained and were given a better room at front of hotel internet went down on first night and was down for about a half day that was annoying in this day and age we booked a night stay with breakfasts included at checkout they told us we only booked the nights so we were shocked and they gave us off meals i blame the meals confusion on booking com the hotel and meals deal was conveyed in an incredibly misleading manner the only reason we booked this particular hotel was because the deal said breakfasts came with it the breakfast issue spoiled the next leg of our journey also when we checked in they did not appear to be able to find out reservation from booking com the pool was tiny it was merely a dipping pool you couldn t swim in it
