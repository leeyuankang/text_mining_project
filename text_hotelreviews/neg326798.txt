the property is more expensive than most of the four stars hotels in barcelona and therefore we expected better services facilities but we were slightly disappointed the cleaning ladies were opening the door of the room without knocking more than one time every day the rooms do not have the do not disturb sign and doors can t be locked the breakfast was ok when we asked we were told that the breakfast stays until in the last day of my trip i woke up late jogged around the hotel then entered to have a light breakfast at around the lady told me that they closed the buffet and i was only allowed to make coffee the rooms are very close to each other you can easily hear people s talks from the other rooms it happened at least three times that we woke up when our neighbors entered or left their rooms
