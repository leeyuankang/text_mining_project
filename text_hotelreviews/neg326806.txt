the shower did not have an overhead light it was like taking a shower in a cave the toilet shower had only a strip of lighting floor to ceiling which was not enough we could not turn on the light in the toilet shower without also turning on the light over the sink because there wasn t a wall between the sink area and the bed area just open shelving we could not have a night light the view was nothing to write about just laundry hanging from the apartment balconies and windows around the hotel but we weren t in the room that much so that really didn t matter
