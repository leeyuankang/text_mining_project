standard rooms are adequate but with no view at all unless you like walls the pricing structure seemed to change every day we paid per night for a standard room without breakfast checking on booking com whilst trying to resolve a problem with the costs we thought we d paid the extra for breakfast the same room was available with breakfast for and a delux room with breakfast this may be a problem with booking com and not the hotel but the staff couldn t resolve this to our satisfaction all they could offer was a reduction in breakfast cost of was difficult to locate the hotel as we forgot to take the street number with us
