unfortunately we had some issue with the shower drainpipe and the heating in the room the first night was impossible to sleep on the following morning my boyfriend told the receptionist the issue about the drainpipe and the heating but when we returned at the hotel nothing had changed i had to complain with the night staff he offered us to sleep in a different room it was better but on the following day we had to change again the room so we slept in different rooms in nights we got free breakfast as compensation for the issues
