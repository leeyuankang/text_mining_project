it was most inconvenient to find the room has no desk but only a low bench next to the bed the room was quite small and narrow fortunately the hotel added a simple desk in our room after our request the hotel needs to replace the low bench with a proper desk which would not cost much i saw a few of the low benches in the corridor and assumed that other guests had made similar requests the internet in our room on the floor did not work for three days and apparently fixed it in the last day of our day stay it would have been helpful if the hotel website provides a few lines of detailed information to guide first time visitors more easily find the location including that from the airport it was confusing when we arrived at the verdaguer metro station which has multiple exists we ended up spending min to find the hotel after getting off the metro the gym in the basement has poor ventilation and smelled bad
