i did not have breakfast because it was only available after nearly every day i had activities that made me leave the hotel before then there was an offer for a bag breakfast but that was not very workable for me on the metro note to management i support the use of putting the key inside to activate the lights however sometimes one needs to charge a tablet or laptop were any of the outlets live when the guest was out of the room if so it would have been nice to know which one could be used as a charger when gone
