room small and furniture that was too big for it so space was tight extremely expensive for what you get accommodation wise very hard to get in and out of the shower over the bath without slipping hated that made a booking for a taxi at reception to pick us up so we could make our tour the next day early start got to reception and they had failed to make the booking th guys at reception were not able to be very helpful and so we had to take a chance on the street for a cab and luckily just made the tour would not stay again
