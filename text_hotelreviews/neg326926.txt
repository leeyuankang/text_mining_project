the hotel opened in december and our room still smells refurbishment my husband had a minor headache you should think twice if you are sensitive about such smells the decoration is claimed to be modern if you call simple as modern and they actually look cheap this is just a personal opinion of course very poor choices of breakfast considering the price in comparison with any other star hotel you may see the photos poor maintenance you won t believe but they indeed only have one guy for housekeeping on friday poor facilities our king sized bed is actually combined by two single beds our air conditioning didn t work nor did the neighbor s no table in the room washing counter is made of board instead of marble staff are actually ok but the management is a mess we couldn t bear the smell so after negotiating and waiting the reception said we can cancel the other nights and get refund when we check out we called booking com and booking com talked to the hotel for confirmation and changed the reservation from nights to so that we can get refund properly but when we checked out the next morning another staff on shift said she needed reconfirmation and then we waited for three days and nobody from the hotel contacted us when we called the hotel again they said they wouldn t refund us i don t understand if they said they couldn t refund we wouldn t check out in the first place booking com staff are very professional and have been contacting the hotel to get us the refund as the hotel promised we are still waiting i couldn t believe this is a star hotel where is the honesty and integrity everything i described here has recording as proof i chose this hotel because of those good reviews but other than the location i don t think this hotel is of good value for money at all i booked it at an average rate of euros by the way
