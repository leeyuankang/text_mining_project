i had a bit of an strange breakfast experience food was good as was the venue but the person that seemed to be running the tables managed to spoil everything after waiting for a bill i left to check out and came back to be greeted with insinuations that i had left without paying and an aggressive attitude about how i wish to pay if you are having a bad day that early on don t come in as it ruins the experience of your clients i flagged this at the check out desk when passing by again in the most constructive way possible got an apology but no offer to sort things about i ended up paying more than the normal breakfast charge which should not happen on top of everything else
