the hotel is new so they do not yet have a bar or dining area for the evening however these are not essential and didn t detract from our stay the cleaners come at around which was often when we wanted to come back and rest before the evening but again not a huge problem as they were quick and usually done within minutes it would have been nice to have a mirror in the main room not just the bathroom
