this hotel has very little in the way of sound proofing we could clearly hear our neighbours coming in next door as if it was in our own room and someone walking above us was as loud as if it had been in our own room some of the finishes are obviously not top quality and the room already showed a small amount of wear and tear which will certainly show over time and require a lot of upkeep also the name of the hotel is not ideal
