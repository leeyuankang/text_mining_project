upon arrival we were offered a room with twin beds or a double bed naturally as a couple we decided on the double bed when we finally entered the room there was no bath which was listed on the itinerary when we were booking the hotel via booking com i asked reception why this was and i was told that the baths are only available in rooms with twin beds and to add insult to injury the room was on the first floor facing the busy street outside
