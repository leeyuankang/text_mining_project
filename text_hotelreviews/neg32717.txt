the staff at the restaurant where the breakfast was served was the only down side of the hotel they were completely incapable of running a organised breakfast service people had to wait long for tables and then for the waitress to notice their presence though when you got the breakfast it was brilliant both the complimentary breakfast and the food on the menu for the customers that where not staying at the hotel make sure to try their sourdough as well as the swiss cheese they use they are brilliant
