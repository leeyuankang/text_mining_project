i wouldn t considered this hotel a stars i had major issues with the air con during my trip the temp outside was around celsius i complained that the air was not cold enough and strong enough all they said was that it was central and nothing they can do about it all they can do was change the filter changing the filter helped a little but it took my body to cool down about to hour in the room i was also a little peeved when i came back to my room at to get away from the heat but the room wasn t cleaned i called the front desk and they said the cleaning of the room time is till most hotels i stay at the rooms are cleaned from to pm also for a star they don t offer small things like a kettle or a box of tissue paper i have been to stars hotel that offer better services overall the hotel was considered just passable for a stars the price i paid was a little steep my last advice is do little more research in what is available before choosing this hotel
