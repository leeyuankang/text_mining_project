everything was great and the only thing that would have made the stay more pleasant would be a top sheet on the bed we understand it is the european norm and we may be in the minority but we don t like having the heavier duvets on when we sleep we keep our room cooler than most and we both still get hot in the middle of the night with the duvets and would love to have a top sheet to use instead
