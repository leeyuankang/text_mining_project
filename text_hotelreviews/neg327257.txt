when v checked in they said the room is already paid for and it s deducted from my card as it was prepayment non cancellation i was quiet happy about that but later while checking out another staff early morning got us our bill that was a shock as i was told euros were already charged so it wasted a bit of time and v spent extra euros in shopping thinking v have paid it all in advance he apologised and said it was a wrong information given to us
