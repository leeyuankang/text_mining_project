the room was a bit small and so the bed had to be just a standard double there was only one bed side table even though a little one could have fitted if we had asked i m sure we could have been moved to a different room but we liked being on the first floor in the summer it might be better to be on a higher floor and not at the front so the windows could be opened without the street noise being a problem
