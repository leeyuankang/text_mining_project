we had bought the breakfast option while booking but we had it only the first morning the reason the service was just too long we had to wait for full hour to be served two cups of tea and the standard menu option we solicited waiters like times we started our morning nervous and with hour delay that was just not nice so in the next mornings we gave up on the breakfast option despite having paid for it also the room had a tiny window too high to be able to see outside a bit claustrophobic given also the tiny size of the room
