the best question in context of my stay would be was the hotel value for money unfortunately the answer is no from the beginning to the end i was disappointed i location was good due to connectivity to the other areas by public transport bus stop public transport airport buses and tourist buses were less than mins away and metro station was also close by but the good things ended here for me wifi was sub standard no electric kettle in the room room was small and many more issues would like to make a special mention of an episode i am from dubai and hence needed an adapter to connect my chargers and other devices to the european plug points i asked for them in the reception from my room s intercom inspite of being tired after a hrs flight and after paying hefty room charge i was told to come down to the reception to take it i went down and to my surprise i was given a box with some usb cables and other useless cables to choose from and when i complained about it they said its not available and gave me the address of a supermarket to buy the stuff this was a turnoff of me within minutes of entry to the hotel this is just one of the several disappointing incidents that took place in short i would like to say highly overpriced minimal facilities no room service and arrogant staff i would have got better hotels at better locations at better price
