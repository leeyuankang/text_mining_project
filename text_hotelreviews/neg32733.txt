walls very thin you practically hear everything your beighbors are doing breakfast is served in a small restaurant next to the hotel that can also be used by external guests we wanted to have breakfast around yet the restaurant was overcrowded and we had to wait to even enter once seated we had to wait ages to even get the menu our hotel reservation included breakfast of per person yet there is a separate menu with choices only for hotel guests for the regular menu or any additionl requests you need to pay on top service was a disaster they forgot to serve us coffee the other day orange juice and spoons also they served the wrong dish and treated us rude prior to being seated at a table in the end we were charged on top for black coffee even if it should have been included in the hotel menu had the impression personnel was stressed out and completely overwhelmed so better have breakfast elsewhere if you want have a relaxed start in the day
