the location of placa espana is further from the old city center than we expected in the heat of the summer it was not ideal to walk in out of the center every day however you could certainly take a cab for maybe euros or the bus we just prefer to walk not many great restaurants nearby as well everything was at least min walk away if not more the internet was absolutely terrible this was probably our biggest complaint as my boyfriend was supposed to be able to work for an hour or so each night the wifi continually made you log in every time you left the room and it cut out frequently
