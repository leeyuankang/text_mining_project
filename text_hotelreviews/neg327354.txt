most rooms where too noisy or too dark we asked to be changed times because of sant juan apparently we were charged per night which was outrageous for the quality this hotel is quite far from town centre and extremely noisy overall given proximity of massive roads the staff was incompetent to say the least and not really helpful some didn t even speak any foreign language finally the breakfast quality was below average quantity was okay
