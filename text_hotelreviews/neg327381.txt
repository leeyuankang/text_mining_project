the room was quite small and had very little natural light as the room was overlooked we had to have the blackout blind closed the lights in the room didn t allow for an ambient light the light controls either turned all the lights on which included bright tubes above your head as you lay in bed or just a cold reading it would be nice just to have the lamp on generally the hotel had a dark feel due to extensive use of stylish but dark stone tiles
