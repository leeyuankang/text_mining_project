where do i begin i wanted an hotel which was near to the city la ramblas this hotel stated it was only a few km away but i found out that wasn t exactly the truth each time i had to pay for the taxi atleast euros in total to get to the city instead if i knew it was that far i would ve paid extra for a hotel nearby which would ve ended up the same amount also the beds were horrible to sleep on i have no words i had the worst nights ever so squeaky and hard i found the bedding hadn t been washed for the second night we travelled as a family of so i requested a cot for my month old i was appalled the cot was half broken for the price i think it s a rip off far from city rude staff very late room service arrival no kettle in room to make my baby s milk each time i had to pay to get water boiled overall i wouldn t recommend or come here again total waste of money
