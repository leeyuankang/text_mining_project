i was visiting with a friend and booked a twin room but we had to move some furniture around to get the beds separated the pictures are a bit misleading our bathroom was very decent but not as fancy as the pictures show same with the room it was hard to get the room dark and there is a lot of space under the door to the hallway getting a lot of light from there door to the bathroom is glass and there is no way to cover the bathroom windows
