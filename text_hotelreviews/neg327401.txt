a minor complaint when i went down for breakfast on my last morning i was advised that breakfast was not included in the pre paid price for the hotel i requested breakfast when i checked in and was informed that i could pay when i check out the receptionist validated my credit card therefore i was somewhat suprised to be told that i had not paid for breakfast when i had already agreed to pay when i check out the young man was very polite and was quite sensitive in handling this situation perhaps the information had not been made available to him the hotel might need to review the procedure for this scenario to prevent possible embarrassment for guests this did not spoil my stay and i would happily recommend this hotel
