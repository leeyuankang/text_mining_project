as it is becoming trendy there is a glass bathroom door which means that when the light in the bathroom is on then the whole room gets illuminated this is very disturbing when sleeping the room was too warm and we had to sleep with air conditioning in the middle of january the hotel does not respect its own policy on saving water and therefore the environment even though our towels were always hung on the towel rack they were changed every day the water in the shower became very cold for seconds and then very warm for seconds more and then ok for a short while until the process started again
