we booked double room square but got room instead the room didn t match booking photos and description there was shower cabin instead of bath it had one reading light and one bedside table which makes me think that it was single room with double bed reception girl refused to change the room we was told that this is the only available room although booking com has available rooms at our dates later at the evening we discovered that we couldn t take shower as there was some problems and water didn t go away from shower cabin we was told that nobody could help us until the morning at the reception no other options no attempt to help us we asked to change the room again and was refused the same story no rooms available we demonstrated rooms available for booking at this website but it made no effect
