i was on the first floor and had a really really tiny room the bathroom was totally rundown see fotos and it smelled badly room itself didn t look nice at all i was in a hurry and there was just no time to complain so i decided to take it as bad luck well it s only two nights at around there was a weird noise coming from the aircon or heater that i couldn t turn off no chance to sleep with that noise and i am usually not sensitive i called the reception they showed up and offered me to move to another room so i packed all my stuff in the middle of the night and moved to the third floor uff room was slightly bigger bathroom looked at least nicer no smell that was a huge win really uncomfortable situation but i have to say that the night staff was really friendly so in the end my stay was ok my business colleague on the other hand was on the floor and had a nice large room apparently it totally depends on the room if this hotel is a good option or not hard to know in advance
