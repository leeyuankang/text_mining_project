messed up on one of our reservations we had a confirmation from them with the nights but they did not in their system they told us that they were full and could do nothing to help one of our group members had to rush to find another hotel and pay a premium for it we found out later that they were not full when we looked online they took no responsibility and the customer service was awful rooms are not as pictured some are closet sized and terribly old they downgraded us and did nothing about it customer service was awful downgraded us and then pretended like they didn t and did nothing to fix rude staff after that no amenities no room service no helpful concierge the only good thing about this hotel was it s location but there are plenty of better hotels in that area and much more worth the money we will be making sure our company does not use this hotel anymore
