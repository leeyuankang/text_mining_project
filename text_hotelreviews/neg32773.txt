our room was rather small i had expected a larger room for the money but as we weren t really there to hang around at the hotel this was okay our room was at the front of the building but wasn t noisy at all a great sleep had by us both shower seal leaked and water got on my clothes i was going to put on there was a mix up with our booking and therefore extras i was aware that there were two bookings with the same surname so this could have been the reason but we were given free prosecco for the inconvenience which was very kind
