we booked a superior double room that according to the pictures of booking and the hotel website would be light clean and just in general very nice we came in the hotel and this wasn t at all what we had in mind the staff was unfriendly and very bad to understand the room was old small dark en just overall dirty the bed wasn t a kingsize the blanket was too smal for people and the carpet on the floor was discusting the bathroom was far from clean the bathtub had a broken watertap the toilet didn t flush properly ans so on breakfast wasn t in buffet for per persoon we could only get scrambled eggs with some bacon and english muffin overall we are very unhappy we never ever had such a bad experience hotel before this isn t even worth stars i wouldn t recommend this hotel to anyone they should be ashamed to ask so much money for such horrible rooms we were in london for night only and this really ru ned it for us
