the room our friends had was great but mine and my friends room was awful the heating was not working the bathroom was freezing as the towel rail wasn t working we had someone come and see it but couldn t mend it also the heating system units were outside our window which all came on at in the morning making a terrible noise there was a step between the bedroom and bathroom which you could not see the room seems like a room that was used for over bookings did complain but won t go back as i booked it at the beginning of year i was very disappointed
