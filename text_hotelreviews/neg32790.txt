we booked the hotel three months ago only to arrive and say the hotel was fully booked and we had to move from the booked double superior rooms to a single superior room the bed was not a double as initially stated when we asked and with a partner it was not the ideal scenario we agreed to the change as we knew another hotel that short notice was going to be impossible without paying a lot of money but i am unimpressed and will not be returning as i paid for a luxury room and instead was left with what reminded me of a student halls room which was bang in front of the lift so meant we heard whenever anyone used it
