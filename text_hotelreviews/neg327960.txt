unfortunately we had a horrible experience in this hotel the first week of june after the first night in room upon waking up in the hotel bed i had about big bites of bed bugs bedwantsen chinches de cama all over my back arms and in my face they itched and hurt like mad and i got an allergic reaction as well and needed doctors treatment i have suffered for weeks from these bed bug bites and they totally ruined my day stay in barcelona and a wedding i did not manage to sleep at all the remaining nights the staff seemed shocked as well and moved us to another room after that first night changing hotel was not possible manager was away throughout all our stay upon checking out the staff offered me free breakfast to compensate for the inconvenience i got really angry that this was all they came up with after so much misery and found this totally unacceptable and unbelievable this could happen in a hotel it took me a lot of effort to speak to the manager but she was away and they did not want to contact her eventually they called her after i got more and more angry and the manager offered to fully reimburse our stay that was appreciated it could have all been easier though and without having to get so angry anyway despite this very bad hopefully once in a lifetime experience i must say the follow up from the manager upon getting home was excellent besides the refund i received a long email when i got home with her apologies about the situation and fact that she could not be there in person at the time she wrote that the room would be quaraintained and that they would have pest control clean it thoroughly i was also offered to come again in the future for free to show that a stay can be nice and comfortable in this hotel they would do everything to avoid this from happening again we always stay in and hotels to have proper hygiene but i learnt from this experience that this is not a guarantee
