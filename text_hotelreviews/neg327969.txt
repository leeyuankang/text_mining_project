the manager toni was rude and not accomodating at all i mistakenly booked rooms instead of one i only realized it when we arrived at the hotel i asked toni for a refund and he flatly refused saying it is not their police and i had to forfeit the extra room charge he had the authority to do the refund but refused to do so he said it was my fault and he could not care less nice customer relations toni i hope you enjoyed the free money not a nice area bit of a seedy part of town old run down buildings behind the hotel was the view from our window
