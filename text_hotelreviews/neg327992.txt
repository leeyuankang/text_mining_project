this hotel should not be classified as a star the decor is old fashioned and the hotel rooms and hall ways are in need of refurb beds are uncomfortable and move when you sit up the pool area was the most disappointing aspect though it felt old and tired and could fencing or something be put up to take from the view of other roof tops i had stayed earlier in the week at a star two stops away and it was a different class completely and it was a star too in fact we went there during day to use the pool
