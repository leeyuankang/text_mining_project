the only downside was the parking parking was per night which is a bit steep for guests but we were allowed to keep the car in the garage for the day after checkout while we went out sightseeing barcelona which gave us great value and comfort in not having to move the car before leaving just a heads up warning if arriving by car this hotel has an underground garage which is safe and secure but it is a very steep and narrow decent to get there our car is very big and we had to reverse multiple times in the middle of the decent just to get around the corners with only cm on each side of the car to the wall before deciding to use this garage please take the elevator down from the reception and have a walk through the garage before getting into a though spot with your car
