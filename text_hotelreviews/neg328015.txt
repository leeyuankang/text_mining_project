the breakfast was not worth the amount of money paid for it luckily many breakfast options around the hotel i don t understand the way hotels have been putting the bed sheets the duvet doesn t go inside a case anymore hotels have been just putting a sheet under and a sheet above the duvet i find this completely unhygienic case with many hotels i visited lately because if you twist and turn at night you end up with the duvet alone without any clean sheets and while the clean sheets are changed regularly and washed in hotel rooms duvets themselves are not i advise all hotels to go back to the duvet pillow like cover as before the lobby is tiny and the hotel name outside is not so big and noticeable i wonder if anything could be done about this
