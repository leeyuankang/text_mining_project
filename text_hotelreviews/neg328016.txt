definitely not stars at best tea bags and milk weren t replenished after the first day so we had to keep asking reception for more they would only give us two tea bags at a time and they ran out of black tea in hindsight we would ve gone to the supermarket next door to buy our own on arrival we were told we had been upgraded but the room was extremely basic i wonder what the basic rooms were like we were given a twin bed on arrival instead of the double we requested so i wonder whether they mentioned upgrade to keep us sweet at the end of our stay we asked if it would be easy to grab a cab off the street to get to the airport and were told by the guy on reception don t worry i ll call you one it will be here in mins that s really kind we thought but when we arrived at the airport the taxi driver had added on an euro supplement to our euro fare because it had been pre booked by our receptionist outrageous we felt totally ripped off and was a horrible end to our stay
