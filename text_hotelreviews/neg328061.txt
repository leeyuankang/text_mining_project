bit dodgy facility wise for a star hotel the room was extremely small nespresso machine had old capsule inside and they didn t refill the capsules even after couple of nights so i m guessing its only for one night bit intrusive housekeepers as we asked them for the room to be cleaned later but two of them at different times just barged in without knocking
