it is not what you would expect to find in a star hotel the interiors are very outdated and the rooms do not have any light we were first placed in a tiny room with no light at all there are no ceiling lights in the hotel or any spotlights just two small lamps at each side of the bed however after bringing this up to the reception they moved us to a bigger room because the room was facing the sunrise and it was a wonderful weather during our stay the room got extremely hot to the point we started sweating and lucky for us the ac was not working
