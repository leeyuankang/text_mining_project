we asked for a double bed whereas we got single beds standing next to each other they kept on moving apart which was really uncomfortable we also asked for a possibility to get a room with a balcony at least a month before our arrival but the one we got had a view on the patio and no balcony the breakfast was rather dissapointing arround there were already no eggs left an even though the breakfast is served till there was no second round of those wchich is pretty unfair to those who prefer to eat a bit later
