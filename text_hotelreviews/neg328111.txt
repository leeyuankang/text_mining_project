we ended up with single beds pushed together that wouldn t usually have been a problem but the beds were very unstable on the floor and would roll apart extremely easily they d roll away from the head board and roll away from each other leaving a huge gap in the centre it wasn t the end of the world but very annoying for a couple traveling together also the walls are very very thin the rolling beds were obviously an issue in other rooms as you could hear furniture moving around through the walls and ceiling and hitting the head boards the doors to the rooms aren t very secure there are signs saying make sure you close the door securely which i did but one day we returned home to find the door open luckily nothing was missing but this was very disturbing the jacuzzi water looked a bit murky we still used and enjoyed it but it could have looked fresher and more inviting rather than a dirty bath
