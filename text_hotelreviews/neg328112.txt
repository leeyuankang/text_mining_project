the place is a dump and not worth the money it s clean enough but a depressing lobby and reception area my stomach sank the minute i walked into the place room was okay but very bare with a small t v far away from the bed we could hear everything from the bathroom above us and we had a backflow of sewer gas one morning after a sudden thunderstorm if this place was half the price they could get away with this but they ve got a lot of nerve charging such a premium price
