we made the mistake of booking on booking com their website was very deceiving in that when we reserved the room the website reported the room we reserved was booked and to book another room which we did much to our surprise the website congratulated us for booking two rooms we tried to correct it with booking com booking com said we had to correct it with sunotel and sunotel said we had to correct it with booking com the issue was never resolved and we paid twice what we should have paid shame on booking com beware of their website
