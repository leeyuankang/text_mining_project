the air conditioner was not working properly when we arrived it made noise but almost did not give any cold i asked the guy on the reception to help with it when we came later the temperature in the room was rather good it was evening already and they offered us a bottle of champagne as an excuse but finally till the end of our stay during the day it was really hot in the room with the ac put at degrees we had to keep the curtains closed all the day not to have additional heat from the sun but it was getting better only by late in the evening this was really disappoiting and annoying the temperature in the reception area was also too warm so we supposed the whole hotel did not have any good ac but later our friend told it was ok in his room so at least if you our room try to change it staff in the cateen cafe was not friendly at all but actually it does not matter in the bathroom you will only find shampoo shower gel and soap even no body lotion smoking zone just near the swimming pool i could often smell smoke when sunbathing
