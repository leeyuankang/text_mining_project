bed and pillow was very uncomfortable virtually no soundproofing in the hotel you could hear conversations in the rooms either side and when you are in the bathroom you can hear people in the rooms below and above i am aware the hotel is not expensive especially as it has a pool and is in a good location but i would not recommend it
