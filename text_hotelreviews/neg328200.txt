the sunotel barcelona is a medium priced hotel located on the gran via in inner barcelona the location of the hotel isn t the best although it is about a block and a half from the nearest subway station however it is minutes from la ramblas and the rest of the bustling portion of barcelona when we arrived we were greeted by a friendly gentleman who gave us a quick overview of what to do in the city and gave us our room key upon entering the room we immediately realized it was much too hot to be comfortable this is because during the winter the sunotel turns off its ac and encourages guests to open their windows to better cool their rooms as we put our things away we noticed that the toilet in our room had what looked like fecal matter stained onto it perhaps from the previous occupant for lack of a better word this was pretty disgusting we didn t spend much time in the room that day as night fell we made it back to our hotel we had traversed the entire city and needed a good night s rest the blankets in the sunotel were winter blankets but they were almost impossible to sleep under given the temperature of the room even after opening the windows as the night progressed mosquitos flew into our room due to the fact that the window did not have a screen on it i was bitten by mosquitos every night i stayed at the sunotel closing the window would have solved the problem but would have made the room extremely hot the beds also had wheels on them so if you were one to toss and turn in your sleep you would be surprised to discover that upon your waking you d be in a different place in the room than you were when you went to bed the wheels of the beds as well as the flooring used in the sunotel a strange hybridization between linoleum and fake wood caused this and allowed the beds to freely move on their own
