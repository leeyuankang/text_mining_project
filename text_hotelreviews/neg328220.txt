pretty expensive eur pers for breakfast is a waste of money as there are small coffe bars starbucks and local bakeries just around the corner rooms are pretty small we had a beds room and there was actualy no place to put your bags after the third bed was put in the room view from the window was looking over backyard actualy in other people s windows and balconies did not impress me tv did not work and we had to call reception every day to activate it mini bar was well equipped but no bottle opener i think you can find better deals for the price of this one also close to the town centre
