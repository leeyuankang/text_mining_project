we paid a bit more for the superior room which was very disappointing scuffs on the walls battered furniture not enough room to open the door properly and only one bedside table because it was that small disappointing when you ve seen the photos and description on this website and the hotels own website and are lead to believe you are staying somewhere totally different not a nice feel to the room at all also paid extra for continental breakfast which was insubstantial if i was to stay here again which i won t i wouldn t bother with the breakfast
