very oddly greeted by a chance to upgrade from a superior twin room to two non superior singles which i assume based on reviews i had read before booking were small and uncomfortable rooms not to be recommended and very unhappy staff when we wanted to keep our prepaid superior room instead of checking us in they thought it more important to go on the phone to say that room xx will be staying to whoever wanted to sell our room twice bad manners to do that before finishing check in of the customers in front of you the toilet in the bathroom had a loose flushing handle it was badly attached at an angle and looked and felt like it might fall off any second and did not flush properly told staff and they dismissed it with oh it s like that you just have to pump it a few times the bar cafe in the lobby had extremely loud music in the evening it was painfully loud actual my ears hurt and i can t think get me out of here loud so impossible to have a drink or snack there
