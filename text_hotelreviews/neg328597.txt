the arrival at the hotel was really poor the receptionist was much more interested in chatting to the young girls who had come into the hotel asking for directions than they were checking us in to the hotel the girls were not customers guest the junior suites we were due to stay is was best described as truly horrendous no daylight no view a ridiculously small wardrobe and a crazy bad layout of bathroom when we returned to the section to complain about the junior suite the staff were disinterested in our feedback about the junior suite they were not friendly nor were they accomodating we had said we were so displeased with the junior suite that we should move to another hotel the hotel staff said nothing could be done as the hotel was full we went and spoke to two other guests who arrived as we were checking in and who also had a junior suite we took great comfort that they also thought the junior suite was horrendous and that the staff unhelpful they told guys they were to be moved to another room the next day returning to reception they then agreed to move us to another room the next day upon reflection i wish we had moved to another hotel our trip involved a return to the city for further days on the return leg of our trip and decided not to stay here as i would not consider this hotel nor its unhelpful staff again undoubtedly the hotel will make all sorts of excuses but plain and simple the hotel does not represent value for money and i would not recommend it
