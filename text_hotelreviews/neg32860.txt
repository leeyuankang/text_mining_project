the washroom was very unsafe and dangerous the tub shower was raised off the floor and had a stationary glass partition at the front of the tub shower you had to step over the toilet to enter or exit the tub shower there was no grab bar but there was a very hot towel rack which could burn you if touch when trying to enter or exit the tub shower the toilet was quirky you had to flush at least two times after each use you could hear people in other rooms
