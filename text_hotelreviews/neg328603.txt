the bathroom was cramped and not well appointed some hotels have great bathrooms this was not one of them the drains were clear though don t laugh this can really be a problem the hvac unit was really annoying and while you could turn it off you had to remember to do so every time you returned to the room if you like waking up to a fan blowing cool air into the room in the morning then you have no problem thought that the hotel was a bit overpriced but then again it was barcelona and getting to be summer when the hotels are best booked well in advance
