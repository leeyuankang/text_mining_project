it s very hard to be picky on this hotel the only let down we had was the evening meals portion control up and down and served on different plates from the time before over cooked food i had duck night then had the rolled chicken breast i didn t order crispy duck and pancakes and the chicken burnt on the bottom and dry people ordered the same dishes as us and the portions and presentation was totally different just to polish it of with a cherry i know it s a hotel in barcelona but for a little bottle of water is just a little to much to ask for people are different where ever you go and to get all your staff to be the best you have to wave your wand but it s not to much to ask for a little smile or a good morning or afternoon over all its a good hotel with little to be picky about i just expected more from the evening menu quantity quality and hot food
