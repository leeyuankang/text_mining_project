as a frequent traveller there are small things one expects when arriving at a hotel this one was disappointing the front desk staff make you feel like you re interrupting them i arrived hours before normal check in time of and was given no option to check in early i arrived back at and was left standing while the girl at the desk stared at her screen i asked if there was a problem and she said she was just checking on the room i eventually got my key and on arrival to my room found the cleaning staff working on it when they finally finished the room was left with a smell of stale cloth there was an aroma of alcohol from at least one of the front staff their uniforms were worn and depressing colours brown and black and in need of sprucing up i travel all over the world every week i wouldn t stay here again based on this experience
