the booking process on this website led me to believe that parking and a breakfast were included i had carefully browsed all of the options for one i wanted for my honeymoon but according to the staff when i arrived i had just reserved the room and been alerted to the costs of each amenity i would be charged extra upon check out for parking and breakfast which we ended up skipping to avoid the extra fee
