may have been helpful to get more information about public transport eg metro buses as the hotel is quite a walk from beach and other tourist sites however we were able to reach most of them quite easily only other aspect was our room window happened to be facing a concrete wall so we didn t have the best view from our room however the views from the pool and terrace made up for this as they were beautiful
