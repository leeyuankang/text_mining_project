i was very suprised i did not like my experience here as i had high expectations first thing was there was feather everything pillows and duvet the staff changed the pillows for me but i was allergic to the room the whole time so much so i had to take anti histamines secondly the toliet did not flush well you had to press it several times and despite the bathroom looking clean there were hairs on the towel and when my room was cleaned the second day my toothbrush was just placed down on the sink and finally the elevator was incredibly slow and there was only one since my room was near the elevator it was also very noisy so not the most restful stay
