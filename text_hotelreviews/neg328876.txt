if you wish to charge like a first class hotel you can t manage like a second rate hotel this hotel isn t value for money nicely decorated premises and well located but very poorly managed we checked out after days and went next door to el palace the old ritz which was far superior in all respects and literally half the price the manager of the cotton house needs to start managing the hotel we phoned the manager to share our concerns and never had our call retuned says everything you need to know about the lack of interest in the guest experience staff are very friendly but mostly untrained they need to spend less time talking to each other and pay more attention to their guests it all has a whiff of faulty towers about it day no housekeeping turndown service day no housekeeping at all it took phone calls to finally get our room cleaned the large maid s trolley stayed in the narrow corridor near our room all day coffee machine in the room was nice to have but day we only got decaf capsule and caf for guests and no milk we spoke to the housekeeper day we only got decaf capsule and no milk breakfast choices are limited and more characteristic of cheaper star european hotell you will need to ask or times for a coffee even though the barista only needs to press a button on an automatic coffee machine you will recognize from airport lounges coffee capsules in a first class hotel restaurant really step off the elevator on the floor onto carpet that is filthy and stained the fitness centre is a fitness closet small little equipment and no water on day it was locked went to reception who said they would send a colleague who never arrived finally managed to get a maid to open it after a long wait rooms have the world s smallest complimentary water bottles must have been a real effort to source them
