unfortunately we seem to have caught the height of trainee season i m assuming regular staff was on holiday and service was overall poor further worst breakfast eggs benny i ve had in a long time totally undercooked and poor massage in a tiny noisy room this is all quite unacceptable especially given the price tag of the hotel
