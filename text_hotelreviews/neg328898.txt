people say watch your wallet in barcelona it is easy to be pickpocketed i feel like i was cheated by this hotel they should ve posted a picture of the window side deluxe room the view from my room was terrible there was an air vent with a noisy so we couldn t open the window besides the room was enclosed with the high wall right next to the building as you might imagine this hotel screwed up my first impression of barcelona i wonder how this hotel got five stars i felt really stuffy and dry so i ask someone to change the room but they answered every deluxe room has same view so if i want to stay with a normal window view then i need to pay euros more to get an updated room even i booked with a pretty high price it was almost i felt really sorry to my friend because chose this hotel it was just waste of money
