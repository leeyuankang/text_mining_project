the photographs of the superior rooms are not the superior rooms these are photos of the suites the superior double felt like a standard double not designer or boutique hotel standard the beds are not king size do not be fooled i think there are only a couple of suites and these are booked usually i was disappointed in the room but we paid only if i had paid more i would have been unhappy as i hate being mislead or tricked in this way change the photos please thank you
