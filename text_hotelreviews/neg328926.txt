when we first arrived to the hotel by car i hurried to the reception to get the directions to the parking while my husband was waiting for me in the car they handed me a paper with a map drawn on it and on which the names of streets were barely showing the lady who was at the reception asked me to wait until her colleagues finishes with the clients so that he can explain to me how to get there since it was my first time in barcelona when i asked the guy for further directions he laughed sarcastically and said just follow the map as if i was stupid to ask him this question i think he was the manager for that evening when we wanted to check in and they couldnt find lebanon on their system the lady helping me asked him so he also sarcastically commented in italian and started laughing the next day we needed more towels so i called the reception and the same guy answered saying he doesnt have anyone to bring us towels but if need be he can give us a towel if we come to reception which i find to be a little bit unprofessional i mean he could have at least asked a colleague but anyway i was not impressed at all with the staff however the bed was comfy
