i noticed that payment was taken from my account upon booking i believe this is for verification purposes and the payment was then refunded a lower amount due to exchange rates this effectively causes the bank to apply fees for non a non uk transaction upon final payment another set of fees are applicable for another non uk transaction i have not come across this before but certainly something this is not desirable
