the pool size pictures on the web are misleading i do not consider that to be a pool important to know that it is a very small pool the television connection was bad for some channels like disney it was not working or breaking up toilet paper was not refilled after first cleaning visit the lack of light in the family suite the window was more like a light opening except no light came in so it felt like a basement room
