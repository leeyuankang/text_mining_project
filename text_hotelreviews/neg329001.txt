at the front desk you can find great staff like the young lady that checked me in and staff that doesn t even recognize you as a client they could probably use more communication as well there isn t many info about the hotel s services like the pool restaurant bar or gym in the rooms you can t find that info either as the hotel was having some maintenance done there were some awkward moments like the fire alarm shooting at and having to wait to get inside the hotel because they were fixing the front door in the middle of the day however this are details the overall experience was great and i would definetely go back
