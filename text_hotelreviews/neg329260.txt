as a general comment the hotel is in need of some investment particularly in the bedrooms where the d cor is tired a bit shabby and the furniture has been well used i am sure the rooms vary but mine was very dark with just a small corner window facing into a courtyard the dark coloured furniture did nothing to brighten the room there was a sense of staleness and lack of freshness the only negative on the breakfast which was really very good is that the scrambled eggs on all three mornings were poor overcooked and unappetising looking surprising as the spanish do them so good there is no proper restaurant but you can dine from a limited menu right through the day and evening from the bar area where there are about four tables not the most atmospheric dining experience but expect most people go to restaurants nearby because i was on a yoga course i was not in going out mode so dined in bar on two evenings and have to say bit to my surprise the caprese salad was the best i have ever eaten and the other dishes i saw looked great too
