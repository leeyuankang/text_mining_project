the decor it was too dark and small very modern and no place to relax if you didn t want to stay in your room finally it was a sunken room with stairs leading down to the beds i think it s a bad idea to have steps leading to the bathroom especially if you are trying to go to the bathroom with minimum light you could trip slip
