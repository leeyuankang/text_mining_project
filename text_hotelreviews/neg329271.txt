we had to change rooms as the first room we were given smelled badly of cigarette smoke an unpleasant surprise in a non smoking hotel also the furniture was showing signs of wear and tear and cleanliness was not perfect the new room was of a much better standard still i would not call this hotel value for money i d expect more of a four star hotel at least breakfast included
