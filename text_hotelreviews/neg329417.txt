first thing i noticed was the safe in our room had dead batteries last thing i wanted after a long flight was to sort that out especially when the automated phone for room service was fully in spanish staff at the counter came across as rude upon enquiries the hotel is out dated and highly over priced even the drink prices at the rooftop bar we re a joke we heard loud bangs throughout the night on more than one occasion its like the walls in this place were paper thin i don t even think this was due to renovations the public computers in the lobby were riddled with malware and when we tried to print our bording pass s the computers played up and we couldn t print our documents we came back the next day to find spammed copies of our private documents sitting on the desk we stayed nights want some advice as we walked pass the hotels and they looked much nicer and more conveniently located
