at certain times you would have to wait over minutes for lift to arrive and when it did it was too full to enter phone in room didn t work rooftop terrace was the main reason we booked hotel it is truly amazing however it was booked for private party out of the days we were there which was very disappointing and we were not told in advance not a great view from room but we didn t mind as only used it to sleep in
