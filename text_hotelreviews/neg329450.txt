found the automatic door in the front entrance of the hotel and also stairs to the rooftop a little dangerous for small children my daughter s head was almost caught in between the automatic door and it didn t have any emergency stop when my hands were holding them not to close and squash her head but this won t stop us to come back to this wonderful hotel
