the lounge area was very pleasant and attractive but is also shared by the few people who choose to dine in the hotel i hope that the diners were not put off by those just having a drink at neighbouring tables i believe that the hotel is addressing this by building a new cafe bar for dining which will be separate from the hotel lounge the hotel s traditional dining room is used only as a large and very nice breakfast room bedrooms are not large and many have unglamorous internal views but this is to be expected in a large traditional city centre hotel none of this detracts from the fact that this is an excellent hotel and we had a marvellous time there
