personally i was disappointed with the room itself unfortunately it was nt up to the standard of the hall way the room was small and basic the one that we occupied had no view we were just facing a another room and grey walls with the blind drawned you do not have the notion of time the mattress needs changing the springs are gone it is uncomfortable and with this you will not have a good night sleep after a long day visit of the city at least if the room does nt have a view but has a comfortable bed it compensates
