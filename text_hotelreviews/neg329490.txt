the hotel was very undated the photos don t live up to the standards modern bathroom but on the second night we realised it was leaking also very dated small room the air coniditoning didn t work on our stay so every time we went back to the room it was boiling two hairs also on the pillows once we checked in the staff members were very very rude apart from one staff member which was amazing and couldn t do more to make our stay worth while and make us feel welcome we felt everything that we asked about transport or locations that it was too much for them to handle also a massive language barrier you would think being a star hotel that they would understand us also you could hear everything through the walls could hear the trains early hours in the morning and also one night we could hear music till very early hours
