booked it as special treat for husbands big birthday soooo disappointed that we didn t get to find out the pool much smaller than photos suggest was closed due to work being done on the reception area why no idea and more to the point the reception staff still thought it was open we checked several times but the big sign at the bottom of the terrace stairs just confirmed it was closed until further notice
