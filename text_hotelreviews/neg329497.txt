this hotel has the potential to be very nice however they were doing major refurbishment works which we werent told about the entire front foyer which is very nice was shut and we had to go in a side entrance to a make shift reception the room was ok maybe a bit dated it was very noisy as the nearby train made it sound like there was an earthquake we had a room on the first floor so could hear it there was also banging from the construction from the early morning last negative was that there were no fitted bedsheets there was a sheet above and below the quilt so you woke up to a bit of a grubby quilt covering you apart from that the location is fantastic it also has a very nice rooftop bar and pool
