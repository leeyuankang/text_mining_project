did not experience sewage smell noted in other reviews however one of the double vanity sinks in bathroom did not drain so was pretty much useless no washcloths available and could not get more than one bath towel and one hand towel per day per person even on higher floor could definitely feel and hear rumble of metro supposed to drop key at front desk when leaving hotel which can mean waiting in line behind guests checking in out to retrieve key no self serve laundry on site but very clean modern laundromat within min walk of hotel
