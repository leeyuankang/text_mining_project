staff were pretty demure and not overly friendly did not like that we had to drop our key at the front desk and that they would just give it back upon return by you simply stating the room number without checking your identity i am certain the cleaning staff looked through my bag because i purposely covered my extra handbag with a scarf and when i returned it was displaced nothing taken though thankfully
