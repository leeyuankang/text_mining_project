the hotel is a little dated and pictures were a little misleading there was apparently a breakfast buffet although we were never informed where it was and what the timings were and we didn t feel like we should have had to ask for a double room we were given single beds even though we requested a double bed room keys were to be deposited at the front desk every time you left and on returning you would say which room was yours and they would hand you the key this made us question security as the front door was always open and no front door security while many other hotels in the area had closed doors with security guards with staff constantly changing shifts it seemed as though anyone could walk in and ask for any key and it would be given to them
