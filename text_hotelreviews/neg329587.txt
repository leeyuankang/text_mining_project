the gym only included cardio machines and weights such as dumbells could have been included as this was not benificial to my boyfriend the staff were good however uncoordinated for example one said we had free breakfast due to us being an early booking we then double checked and confirmed this and went ahead however others said we didn t and we were charged i would say some services of the hotel were slightly overpriced spending a small fortune already on a memorable trip we had to pay for an ironing service which ended up being per item lucky it was item as there was no iron in the room also coffees were and breakfast when cafes around the area had this for however i suppose this depends on what you experience you are looking for as i ve said the roof terrace was amazing there could have been a few more sun loungers as we had to wait for them at times
