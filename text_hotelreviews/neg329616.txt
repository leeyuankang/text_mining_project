we didn t use the resutaurant for breakfast because we only wanted a coffee and croissant and felt per person was a bit pricey we were offered a discount on this at check in but instead we found a juice bar called faborit and got a juice coffee and pastry for each which was perfect for us also the room we stayed in was very dark and the view wasn t great but at the price we paid on the gran via i wasn t going to complain i m sure if we had have paid more it would have been a better view as the hotel was huge
