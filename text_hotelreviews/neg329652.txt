the room was not yet air conditioned in april so had to open windows and street noise was too loud staff was not very helpful at first but eventually offered to move us to a view of the side street after a sleepless night we didn t want to repack for a move so instead figured out ways to minimize noise with a slightly open window they should consider turning on their air conditioning system earlier in the year
