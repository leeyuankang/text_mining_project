pictures are misleading the hotel is right on top of the metro so every time a train goes by your windows tremor rooms are old and have a stale smell the bathroom is actually ok major problems for me no hot water the water is lukewarm i ve never stayed in a hotel with hot water problem so this really annoys me internet is extremely slow to the point that it has trouble loading google map i definitely will not stay with this hotel again and will not recommend anyone to stay there i ve been to barcelona at least times and this is the worst hotel stay experience i ve had
