staff members check in time i arrived tired and there were ready rooms but they kept us for an hour in the reception check in time is the breakfast was free for all rooms but because my booking was through booking com and was not included they did not invite us for it or tell us the room was hot and stuffy and it s location is very bad facing other rooms besides you can hear and feel the metro underground which is beneath to the hotel directly people from other rooms were opening their rooms and kept shouting screaming nd laughing till the early morning the room size was not good for star hotel
