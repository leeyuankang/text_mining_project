on a negative side it was the first holiday in years due to my partners ill health it was a special occasion as it was her birthday and i asked on the special requests section of booking com whether the hotel could make it extra special by means of whatever they could on arrival it was a standard room with no flowers or anything and i queried the special request with the reception the lady showed me the conformation of booking from booking com but no special request had been added she added as a gesture that she would send to the room a bottle of cava on the house which we were grateful for but i was disappointed that the special request had not been added at the time of booking
