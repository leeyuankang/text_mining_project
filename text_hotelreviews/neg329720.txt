i booked the suite with a terrace with a view to the sagrada familia one of the more expensive rooms the room has two small green ceiling lights that are on presumably to meet some safety regulation cannot be turned off result poor sleep as the room is at roof top level you get all the cooking smells from the exhaust vents the air con is not great so you open the terrace and windows result smelly room the terrace suite is poor value for money
