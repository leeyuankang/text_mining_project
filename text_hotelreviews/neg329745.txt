the first night we had to share a bed even though i stipulated that we needed twin beds luckily my friend and i have know each other since high school otherwise it would have been awkward the room was a bit shabby and the carpet very worn not a good first impression the second night it was changed to twin room with wooden floors much better the other negative was having to wait until late afternoon to check in as we arrived early we has to change in the ladies room which was not so convenient and checking out at noon and our flight was at again we had to leave out bags in and wear the same clothes all day i have been in hotels where there is a room available to change
