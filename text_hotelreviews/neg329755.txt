the hotel is very dated too much so for comfort for the following reasons only two elevators servicing floors and they are extremely slow i took the stairs all the time instead the funriture and carpets in my room were old and dirty it was quite depressing to be in actually there isn t even a regular phone to dial room service with they provide a phone but are not clear on how to call they provide old fashioned extremely heavy keys which you have to pick up and return to reception regularly the rooms are not soundproof and they put the beds against the corridor wall this means you can hear everything from the staff talking to other rooms slamming their doors i could not sleep from the noise my room was beyond depressing to be fair is was probably the worst room in the hotel but it overlooked a small internal courtyard which made it very dark in addition to the small windows and dark furntiure bed was uncomfrotable pillows were hard and no duvert was provided
