honestly its the most homophobic hotel i have ever been to i was there with my partner and my friends and they asked for an upgrade we did too as it was our anniversary the difference was they were heterosexual they got an upgrade we voiced our opinion to the reception tastefully and honestly unfortunately she was extremely rude and simply rejected us
