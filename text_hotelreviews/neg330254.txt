i specified in my request to have a baby cot in the room this was ignored when i arrived at the hotel i was told it was possible to replace the single bed which they already prepared with a cot i said i would have to take a look at the bed to see if it was necessary not minutes later i called the reception from my room to confirm that i needed the cot after all my request was met with a deep sigh like i was being too difficult anyway the front desk confirmed they would provide the cot fast forward to pm which is past my son s bedtime cot was still not in room we had to ask for it once again at which point it was delivered by a lady who looked a little annoyed despite our best effort to help her set up the cot we are not difficult people just young parents with reasonable requests
