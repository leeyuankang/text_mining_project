pool and sauna isn t up to much pool had floating bits of black in and me and my partner felt very awkward getting into the pool as there was litrally only one seat outside of the pool which was taken and one lady in the pool the sauna was nice but small also there was a naked young lad in the sauna who just didn t seem to mind company awkward the maids woke us up every single morning about by slamming doors constantly when we politely asked them to be a bit quieter it just seemed as it got louder asked a second time still no change complained to reception and explained we are not ones to complain we came back to chocolates on our bed from the maids haha the next morning we was up extra early for our flight so not sure if they watched the doors more careful also our room was at the back of the hotel which we didn t mind but it looked onto school playing courts which could annoy some people wanting a view this didn t bother us as we was out every day exploring but the children did get quiet loud whilst they was playing we would probably say it was more of a star than a but don t know if it s just because we didn t have the best room etc
