on the evening of dec and while we were getting prepared for the christmas eve celebration the electrical power shut down and we were suddenly in the dark without explanation from the staff it took approximately one hour to resolve the problem and to have the power back however it would have been better if the staff explained the situation instead of waiting for the guest to approach them asking what was going on i had this experience in other hotels and always there was a phone call from the staff or a member going room by room explaining the situation
