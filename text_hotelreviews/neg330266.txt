the staff was not that helpful even if i was speaking english with them they were replying in spanish because i m spanish while i was with english people that cant understand quite unpolite from my point of view moreover we asked if they could call a taxi for us as we had some issues with the phone and they refused the extra duvet in the room was dirty the document to write the review had some chewing gum inside so we had not the chance to leave any review
