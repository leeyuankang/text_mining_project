the wifi was absolutely horrendous it was extremely slow when it worked at all mb sec download mb sec upload average from several tests during evening hours especially when i was there for work and needed the wifi to work there were no face cloths in the bathroom to use the iron in the room with a tiny board and no steam feature btw you have to go to the front desk to request a special card the air conditioning works poorly and is very loud the floor in the room was dusty and i was placed on the first floor with a lovely view of a dirty wall and an old dirty sock on a ledge outside the window i would not stay here again
