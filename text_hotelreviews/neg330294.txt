the accommodation was pre paid for by my company like they have always done in the past but i was refused check in as i didn t have the payment card with me i have to point out here that it was mentioned to the hotel about the card holder not going to be present during the booking i was then requested to make another payment using a card in my name this was very distressing and could easily have left me stranded if i didn t have additional money on me to cover the cost of the accommodation which was in excess of euros
