the restaurant manager antonio grahera was rude to me on my last day i decided to take a breakfast at the restaurant as soon as i entered he asked me for my room number which i gladly provided he said my breakfast was not included in my hotel rate and that was correct i replied that i knew about that he asked me to find a table for my self so i did i went to get a cup of coffee and while on my way back to the table he asked me to sign the check i was surprised because i was not even seated yet and had not started anything in fact i asked why he s rushing instead of giving me a nice reply he said well you know you need to pay you re mentioned my name right i said yes then you need to pay i really felt insulted by his rudeness he must be thinking that i would leave without paying i reported the incident to the front desk manager zen who was really nice he apologized but never antonio who remained proud of what he did for this i would not recommend this hotel to anyone
