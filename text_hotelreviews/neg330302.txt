i booked this for my mums birthday so we could do a city break together as she had never been to barcelona before we arrived late gone midnight and so out a do not disturb sign on the door as we were both shattered from traveling from that day at the following morning we had a maid come in and then a call from reception asking when are we leaving the room so it could be cleaned days later they came in around putting the lights on and asking again when are leaving so they can clean the room the minibar was half empty and then tried to charge us for the drinks which were originally missing after paying almost for nights didn t include breakfast i wouldn t go there again they didn t even ask how our stay was when we checked out and asked if we were sure we hadn t had the drinks out of the mini bar before deleting them off the bill i stayed in another hotel just up the road a lot cheaper and it was a lot nicer i was very disappointed with this hotel
