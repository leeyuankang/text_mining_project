on arrival we were told that our room would not be ready until and to go away and come back although we were checked in we arrived back to the hotel early as we were tired from the flight we had to wait for over an hour before we asked if we could be let into the room the lady was very rude and told us it had been ready for a while although they knew we were sat in reception waiting for our room when we got to the room they rang us to tell us we hadn t been checked in correctly so had to go back downstairs it all semmed a bit unorganised and not very friendly we also had a triple room a double and a single the single bed was so uncomfortable that we couldn t use it
