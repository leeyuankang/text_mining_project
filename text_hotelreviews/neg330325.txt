our room had a window looking into the atrium it was covered by a curtain and the other window looked into a dark alley so there was no natural light in the room but the biggest negative was the noise from the atrium early every morning when s guests returned from a night out the sounds from the atrium lobby were very loud in our room they should install some kind of sound absorbers to reduce the noise from the atrium
