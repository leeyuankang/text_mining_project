the breakfast catering facilities and the food were definitely not star the restaurant itself was very basic and not of a standard that one would expect from a star hotel i would not expect to have a basic automatic coffee machine of porr quality coffee and then to be charged extra if ordering an espresso the fruit juice was terrible it tasted like powdered drink and i was not able to drink it the food range was poor and little options for vegetarians as we are we were offered chips french fries with our breakfast choice this was not what we were expecting from such a hotel in spain we had just relocated from a paradore cardona and the difference in food and ambiance was striking yet supposedly the same star rating restaurant staff were efficient but too fast and no one smiled they made the breakfast experience rather unpleasant and made us feel unwelcome they were very much set on the process of getting breakfast over with and getting ready for lunches this was areal shame as it was a special weekend for us and the hotel did not live up to its own publicity and marketing i may well use these hotel again but not book breakfast
