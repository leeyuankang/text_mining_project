where do i start check in was abysmal we arrived exhausted and late after flight delays to a rude receptionist booking com had given me the wrong costing not their fault but they weren t particularly helpful then i checked we d got a quiet room as i d red the reviews about rooms at the back he said we did we arrived to find we were next to the lift and housekeeping and at the back it was and i was shown rooms all of which were back facing and shabby i found a hair in the last bathroom but we were too tired so decided to just take it we were woken at by kid playing football the air conditioning didn t work so we had to sleep with the window open the fridge didn t work either the toiletries weren t replaced and my boyfriend s swimming shorts were hug in the bidet the only apology we got was a bottle of cava to the room not very impressed at all the coffee cups are paper overall it just feels tired and shabby i wouldn t go back and stay there not when you can stay in some amazing places that look and feel and no to the reception who said maybe this is the kind of hotel you re used to i m not i m used to way better service i ve stayed in hostels and up to that were cleaner prettier and had more welcoming staff that this hotel
