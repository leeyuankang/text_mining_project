my room was over the back of the hotel we were over the play area of schools this includes football and basketball courts these were in use from about until at night the glazing at the rear is very poor i complained the hotel staff treated me as if i was the first person to have this problem and offered me a room which was just above main entrance i later met other guests who had exactly the same experience i wouldn t stay again
