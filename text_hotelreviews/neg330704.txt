we had a room which was quite small and literally looked into a shaft the view from the window was that of the wall and window approximately feet away in an internal shaft this meant that the room was very dark and we could not enjoy the views of the city or anything else for that matter the room smells very musty and i wonder if it has not been used for a while staff told as they were full and we could not be moved i think it would be fine to come here but not booking a standard room as we did a real shame for thehotel
