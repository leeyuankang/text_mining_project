the hotel room zero natural light as the window faced one of the building s walls and the key card holder to turn the lights on broke so i was left in the dark twice funky sewer smell when the windows weren t left open buzzing circuit breaker in the room i was really looking forward to staying here and after seeing other rooms might consider coming back but would definitely request a room with an outside view
