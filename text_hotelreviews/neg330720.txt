i dislike that the hotel charged me one night of hotel on my credit card even though i stated i prefer to pay by cash even though they did a refund for me i still lost some money due to exchange rate also it is true i read somewhere that there s smell of drain but this can be resolved by just closing bathroom door all times and keep aircon running
