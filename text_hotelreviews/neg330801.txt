we didn t like most of it the staff were not particularly friendly or helpful there was a problem with our booking and the man on reception was not helpful and the way he dealt with the situation was bad customer service after this i felt awkward and wanted to be out of the hotel as much as possible i have stayed in many hotels through booking com and the service in this hotel was the worst by far very expensive for the standard we received stayed in hotels all over the world and this was the most disappointing the photos are very deceiving the pool is tiny the hotel is also quite small the porter was very sweet he was the only positive i can say about the hotel no wonder it wasn t very busy if i can give any advice to the hotel management invest in customer service training for your reception staff
