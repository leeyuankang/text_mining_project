bed choices during booking i opted for a large bed as opposed to two singles but got two connected singles they did not have available a room with the bed type i booked room in front of building or back windows do sift most noise but you can still hear the street but back to what i liked next day i checked again with front desk and we were moved to a room facing back of the hotel with a king size bed
