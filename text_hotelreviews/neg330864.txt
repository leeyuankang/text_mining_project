during my recent stay the breakfast selection was limited in comparison with my previous stay i had to wait untill for my room i arrived from the airport at in may not only did i receive my room immediately but i was upgrade to a suite i realize that this i was lucky in may and is not always possible i requested a late checkout due to the scheduled time of my return flight of course i was willing to pay i was flatly turned down i felt that a little effort could have been invested in my request especially given the fact that i was a returning guest and currently a guest for five nights when i was minutes late for checkout i was reminded with a phonecall this was not necessary since the gentleman at the reception desk was well aware that i was getting ready to check put it took me about mins to leave the room on the upside my luggage was held for me and the staff was courteous in retrieving it for me and getting me a cab when the time came to depart
