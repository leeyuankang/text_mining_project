had a two story suite that was nice but the bottom floor was basically a bathroom with a couch in it as it also served as the entrance to the suite it was a bit awkward to walk in and find yourself in a bathroom with no door the steam from the shower set off the fire alarm more than once and sent the very attentive staff to knocking on the door while one was showering in my opionion just a bad design for a suite housekeeping could use a bit of work as well they refilled some things and not others turn down services was a chocolate on the bedstand why not turn down the bed while your e there and althought the place was far from dirty it was obvious that they did not vacume and mop the floors daily overall they were just a bit inconsistent
