the restaurant in the evening served nice food but the evening i ate there it was empty everyone else had gone elsewhere a pity more seriously i opted for one of booking com s cheaper rooms and found myself in a room looking out onto a small covered courtyard about floors deep simply no usable daylight no view of the sky no idea what the weather was like outside without getting up and going downstairs and outside the room itself was excellent but personally i would have liked to have been able to see a bit of daylight my recommendation would be to book one of the rooms with a balcony which seem to be at the back of the hotel or one of the rooms at the front overlooking the gran via this is certainly what i will do next time i return to barcelona and there will be a next time
