when we arrived we were shown to our room however we discovered that the bathroom door was missing and what remained was the broken frame with broken glass fragments in it we complained and were immediately given another room but it was disappointing to think that the hotel staff clearly knew about this already and gave us the room hoping that we would think it was a modern twist to the room to not have a bathroom door
