we were in room and it was quiet very clean and generally comfortable for sleeping it is however quite small for two adults the bathroom was sizeable with good lighting and mirrors water from the shower tended to spill all over the floor because there was no door that made an unnecessary mess there was one hook beside the shower but nowhere else in the bedroom or bathroom to hang towels or dressing gowns the bathroom towel rail heater was too high on the wall and so we couldn t use it for that purpose these were the only negatives in an otherwise great experience
