the only downside to our trip was the service on the rooftop bar and restaurant we were mostly ignored when we were up there and the service was horrendously slow and sometimes did not come at all we were even refused entry on one night when we went up or a drink because they were too busy not good enough in my opinion it was like they were not part of the same hotel rude and obnoxious we did report this to the hotel when we checked out the rooftop area is beautiful and one of the main attractions for this hotel peace and tranquility in a city is a rare touch its just a shame the staff that worked up there let it down
