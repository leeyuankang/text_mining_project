lack of communication between staff due to language barrier there was few misunderstandings regarding reservations for dinner with in the hotel which is not a big deal but i would strongly suggest that all receptionists must be fluent in international language english due to the nature of visitors from all over the world also all staff should be aware that which customers are staying with in the hotel and which ones are just visiting
