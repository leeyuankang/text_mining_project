we relied on the concierge for information regarding the location of the hotel as to where we wanted to go we were misinformed and told there wasn t any point going to the area where all the top designers were ie louis vuitton etc on the sunday that we were there because stores weren t opened on sunday s and on the monday because it was a national holiday everything was supposedly shut down after dinner on monday our last night we happened to come across a very lively street full of restaurants hotels and shops that were opened louis vuitton gucci and other big designers were closed at the time but we didn t know if they were closed because of the holiday or because it was just late several stores were still opened when we arrived late in the evening so it was really disappointing to know we weren t provided with the correct information especially after spending so much money to be in a hotel that was to provide good and knowledgeable service
