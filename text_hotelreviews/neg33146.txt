this hotel charged me twice for my night stay one time at the day of my arrival and second time next day at my departure in spite of my asking the lady at reception to check if payment is done already she assured me that no money were charged so far from my credit card which turned out to be not true i discovered shortage of funds on my credit card in a few days and had to call the hotel to clarify the matter they confirmed their mistake and said that money were returned back to my account upto now i have received nothing i requested email confirmation nothing received so far
