i had to change my reservation from to nights and contacted the hotel a day before arrival through booking com no reply at arrival i asked the receptionist who was not helpful at all and referred me to the booking com site i tried to contact the hotel again through booking com same result the next day i found a friendly and helpful receptionist who could make the change for me so my impression of the service from the hotel is mixed same for booking com for that matter the room itself could need some upgrade esp the carpet and desk which looked old but was otherwise fine quiet at night good bed working wifi
