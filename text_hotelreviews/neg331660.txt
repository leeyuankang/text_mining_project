was a little bit further out than what we liked the room wasnt cleaned one day and i had to go to reception to ask for loo paper no apology from staff which annoyed me we were told the reason the room wasnt cleaned was due to the fact we had put a do not disturb sign on the door which we hadnt also on checking out i think we were overcharged for the mini bar use i wasnt given a receipt we were in a rush so didnt challenge this so just check what your charged when you depart if you have used the mini bar i think there are better value for money hotels more central
