the room was tiny smallest in all our trip we had to empty out our luggage no laundry facility near by and a small fortune use hotel service i think it is cheaper to buy new clothes then wash them which is crazy since there is a hostel nearby teribly small sink in washroom as well there has to be a laundry mat nearby but we never saw one the pool was essentially a lage tub we went to see it but didn t bother mind you all the chairs were taken no one was using the pool just lying around it
