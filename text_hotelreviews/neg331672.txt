a small swimming pool the pool area lacks sun light not good for sunbathing because it s not a rooft top pool and is hidden by neighboring buildings that block the sun also there was no extras like a spa or sauna i would expect that for the price and stars also no free slippers again higher star hotels provide this also it s hard to completely relax because the sound of the doors slamming in neigbouring rooms comes through into my room and the cleaners are outside the rooms from very early making it hard to have complete silence and relaxation
