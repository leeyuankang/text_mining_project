the beds we requested a king size bed and we got one made out of beds wasnt very comfortable to sleep the noise was terrible people would come late and smash doors speak loud at late hours there were only or something tv channels we didn t watch tv much even though we stayed nights the fridge in our room didn t work properly it didn t cool anything we had to ask for ice every night also when we booked the hotel we requested a room with terrace just to find out that they don t have any rooms with terrace available and if we want one we have to pay extra that didn t seem fair because it was an option we could choose when we booked our room the walls are very thin you can hear what the neighbors are doing lol
