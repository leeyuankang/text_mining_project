there was some noise in the early hours as the bins were put out for collection otherwise there was nothing else we could fault the final issue was not with the hotel but with the taxi driver for the return journey to the airport he took us on the scenic route via the port area which was obviously longer and took more time the final bill for the return journey was euro which was nearly euro more than we paid for the arrival journey the big tip here is to agree the fare in advance as stated above it should have been no more than euro
