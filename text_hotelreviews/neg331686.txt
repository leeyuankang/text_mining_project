the furniture is really old worn out and not taken care off the food in the restaurant is really bad we ordered a hamburger and that meat was not even eatable terrible from there we did not eat anything else there not even breakfast there are many small coffee shops near buy that have really good options as well as restaurants and bars when you enter the lobby it smells like sewage and perfume to try to hide the smell that is the first impresion of the hotel
