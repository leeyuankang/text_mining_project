a bar bill was added to my room number which i did have i was really upset about that as i paid all my bill at the bar on the same day and had all my receipt i think that bar receptionist should checked guests i d on the list before adding the bill to your room as the person even put a signature that doesn t even correspond mine i think the staff need more training regarding this matter when they order something
