pictures of swimming pool are not ok swimming pool is very little and only a few people can sit there so don t choose this hotel because of the swimming pool the distance to the metro is ca that is a lot when you travel days to museums beach shops etc there was no facility of showering in the afternoon because my flight departed in the evening a star hotel always has a room available for this service price quality is not ok
