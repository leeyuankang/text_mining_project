there should be proper fridges in the room we had one that rather gave off heat than cool but was very kindly replaced on our first day however was just as useless as the previous one we have been advised that these are not fridges but rather keep cool boxes so we were stuck with that this was only really a problem for us because we needed to cool our son s milk year old the pool is very small and hasn t got many loungers they were all occupied whenever we attempted to go down there so ended up not being able to use the pool
