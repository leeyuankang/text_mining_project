breakfast charge was very expensive parking charge was also very expensive and it starts when your booking starts and by default covers your whole stay if you decide to park elsewhere it will be much cheaper some of the staff was surprisingly rude the guy that worked there on sunday afternoon had a very offensive tone the guy at the night shift during our stay was brilliant and very helpful and compensated for the lack of service his colleague exhibited
