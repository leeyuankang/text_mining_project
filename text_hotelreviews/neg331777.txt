the bed was uncomfortable we had springs digging pinging into our backs and if you moved your partner next to you would bounce around very springy bouncy the bed was the only big negative for us as we didn t sleep very well we didn t use the pool because it was on the ground floor surrounded by buildings and was in the shade for most of the day the pool area looks a lot smaller in real life than portrayed in the photos we didn t mind though because we had our own terrace
