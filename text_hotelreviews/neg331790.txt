when we arrived they told us we couldn t check in until o clock even though it said on our confirmation that check in was a nice lady at the reception said to us since we couldn t check in we could go and help ourselves to breakfast or a coffee so we did but this very rude waiter followed us an shouted in front of the whole room that we hadn t paid for breakfast and not to touch anything until he checked with reception got a complimentary bottle of champagne sent to the room but because we didn t drink it the first day they took it back off us we had to ask at reception for it back some mornings breakfast was a bit cold it seemed like when they were topping the items up they put the hot ones on top of the cold ones also me and my family had a course meal one evening in the hotel when we asked for the bill we were told they do not expect debit cards only cash even though they expect card in the reception didn t think this was acceptable for a four star hotel
