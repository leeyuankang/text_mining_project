i had a night stay and was put in a room where i had to keep the curtains closed all day as there was a walkway beside my window doors that let everyone see in as they walk past for a stay this isn t fair and yes i raised it with staff on different occasions to be told impossible to move rooms and just check each day or pay more for a better room how about you offer to let me know when an alternate room is available i m the guest customer not the source of all of your problems problem was i had already paid a premium price for this hotel and was not happy to upgrade also the housekeeping staff have no concept of noise door slamming talking and excessive banging noises is not ok in a hotel like this and what type of hotel doesn t even have facial tissues in the bathroom sorry to burst the bubble but i stay in hotels all around the world for work and at every point in my days here i was constantly let down and disappointed at a stay that wasn t relaxing i gave the staff chances to rectify and nothing happened not even my leaking toilet complaint for days straight sorry but the rooms are tiny and it s not as boutique as stated just a lot of smoke and mirrors
