our room was extremely small and very badly designed function wise first if you hang your cloths on the hangers provided your clothes would drape over the kettle and wine glasses potential hazard second there is no space to store luggages and walk inside the room without hitting your leg on the sharp edge of the bed third people on the corridor can look right into our room if we open the curtain there is no sheer curtain for privacy so we were forced to close the curtain and turn on the lights even daytime fourth towel hanger is right by light switch by the entrance gross fifth there is no basic amenity provided such as shower cap or lotion in addition i didn t appreciate our hipster check in staff attitude he clearly informed us that your breakfast is not included in the room but you can have it we went to have breakfast and was hit with euro when questioned he said yes i told you can have it but i didn t tell you it was free in the end the other team member kindly took this off our bill
