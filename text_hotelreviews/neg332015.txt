the staff is horrible they were very rude most of the time they don t really care about the customers on my last day i asked for a cab to go to the airport the receptionist said she couldn t help me because there was customer on the line and told me to go outside and find one even though i asked a few times she said she can t help me and completely ignored me afterwards
