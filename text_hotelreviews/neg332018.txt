the hotel is understaffed and so when we ordered some small plates at libertine they took very long and we could tell it was not the fault of the staff there they were very apologetic it s more of an understaffing issue they were tasty despite their delay we were there for one night for my birthday and when we went up to the rooftop for drinks on the evening of our arrival we were told it was closed for a private event it was more than disappointing as we did not get to enjoy the rooftop at all while we were there the breakfast was another chaotic experience there were only employees managing the breakfast bar one for the coffee and one for the food they both seemed frazzled running around we arrived more than an hour before it ended but the plate of pastries scrambled eggs and bacon dishes were empty when we enquired on when they would be refilled we were told the pastries would not be refilled but the eggs should be there in a few minutes i had been excited to try satan corner s pastries so that was too bad it seemed like we weren t the only ones disappointed by the underwhelming breakfast overall the breakfast was overpriced and not worth it i wish we had just gone somewhere else
