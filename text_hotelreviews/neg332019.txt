there was water in the room but it did not have a price so we thought it was no charge as some nice properties offer complimentary water if there is no price i am looking into this to see if this was an error or an accidental charge for something else the barista guy working coffee shop was unfriendly curt and not professional i was taken aback a little by this since the property is so nice and everybody else was so nice he was an angry hipster which has no place in the hospitality industry or a brand like this hotel
