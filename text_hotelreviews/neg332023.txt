for the cost vs the value received i feel that there are better options this was a business trip with selected media and deliberately chose this hotel as it was ranked as one of the top boutique hotels in barcelona however when you compared the average cost per night approx per room w o breakfast and excl other charges i can t help but feel disappointed one of the rooms even got flooded with water after trying to take a shower the toiletries whilst nice were basic no hair conditioner nor body lotion was provided even after asking directly at reception the terrace which is supposed to be a nice area for guests to enjoy is closed during the week and there aren t any gym facilities overall the rooms felt basic and to add to the disappointment there was a mistake and was charged incorrectly this was addressed when i arrived though personally for the price paid i d rather stay somewhere else
