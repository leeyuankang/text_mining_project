for the price paid i expected a lot more nicer room professional staff that the rooftop cocktail bar would be open and that there would at least be some complementary coffee or tea in the room and not that we had to buy a bag of tea for euros if we wanted tea in our room it did not help either of staff at some point forgot to serve us our drinks in the lounge after asking times eventually we got our drinks for free but it still made us leave casa bonay not with the feeling of being a valued guest should the price have not been so high i would ve had less of a problem with this i don t think we ll return
