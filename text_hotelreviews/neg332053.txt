the hotel is at one of the biggest intersections in town and is located at one of the biggest avenues therefore the street facing rooms are extremely noisy despite the well implemented soundproofed windows the room was nicely designed but a bit basic especially compared to the other parts of the carefully designed hotel and furthermore it lacked basic amenities for example the floor has the nice original stone tiles which is authentic but a guest definitely needs slippers as the stone is cold all the time i was quite disappointed that we didnt get any there wasnt a chair neither in the room nor on the balcony the bathroom was a bit small and the tiles and the floor did seem a bit dirty it wasnt horrible but we expected a bit more attention in the rooms from this otherwise nicely designed place
