the hotel is sadly let down by bad housekeeping for example the hand soap was not replaced the floor towel for the bathroom was also not replaced a couple of times and no replacement bag in the bathroom bin one day the complimentary water also was not replaced after i drank it on the first night just an empty bottle left and the cups i used for tea were left at the mini bar dirty the safe also had problems on the last night i m sure i had the code right although one of the guys at the reception came and sorted this out immediately but said there might have been some problem with the circuit the air con would just not get the temperature right and if i didn t open the window during the night the room could get stuffy and dusty also the woollen bed cover had seen better days finally i doubt the floor was ever mopped the same long hairs were on the floor throughout my stay as i said in my positive remarks casa bonay is a beautiful place and the staff are lovely but there is definitely a need to pay more attention on these details once they re addressed casa bonay could go from being a good experience which it was to a terrific one
