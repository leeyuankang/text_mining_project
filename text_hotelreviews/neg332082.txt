no real negatives it is about min walk to el born one of my favorite neighborhoods the neighborhood immediately surrounding the hotel has a lot of great outlet shopping clothing shoes accessories the neighborhood is quiet at night if you want to be right in the thick of it you might want to stay somewhere else i really liked the fact that the room was quiet and it s a only a min walk to a lot of nightlife
