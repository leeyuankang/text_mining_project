very expensive for the quality of the hotel can t imagine how this would be a stars hotel the entrance is very weird no taxi station and taxis are not easy to get there no shops around if you are in a business trip it is not at all a presentable hotel at night lot of noise from the street bath room very small no place to put your clothes didn t dare trying the restaurants in the hotel there is an electric kettle but no packets of tea or coffee or sugar offered
