as i said the hotel is very new and normal processes aren t very smooth yet the hotel is located next to a very noisy street and it s impossible to open the window or sleep without earplugs there was an incident one night we stayed here that came with whole police brigade and firemen or more people in our hallway that made a lot of noise we called the reception and asked around but there was no explanation or apology given pretty underwhelming the restaurant within the building has awful service and is overpriced
