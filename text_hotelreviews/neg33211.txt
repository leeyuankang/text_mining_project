the neighborhood is horrible homeless people outside hotel begging for money adult shops all along the street the neighborhood is dirty dark and unsafe the hotel keeps the door locked once inside it s nice the staff told us not to wait outside for taxis they were willing to call for one and we stayed inside until it arrived nice hotel just a poor location it was also quite a distance from attractions you had to use a taxi way to far to walk
