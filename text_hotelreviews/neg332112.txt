we stayed for two nights one at the beginning of our cruise and one at the end the first night we informed the staff that we would only need a room for people on our return after the cruise we were told that we were all set after our second night stay we were billed the full amount for three people and were told that we should have changed our reservations through the agency in which we booked and that we had to pay the full amount this was not a great way to end our vacation being overcharged for our room because we were not informed about the policy
