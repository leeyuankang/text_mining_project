the room had windows to a corridor so it was not possible to open it without being seen teh room had a raw facility to place the hangers but it was loose and it did not look as if holding ten hangers with clothing so we opted not to use it much that was not convenient since that was the only place for hangers in the room we did not like the bathroom open concept either the toilet seat seems to be in what may have been a closet although it has a door and acceptable space it is separated from the room in which the shower and the sink are located and which has no door
