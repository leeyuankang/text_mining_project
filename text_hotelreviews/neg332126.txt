the room didn t seem cleaned when we arrived we found a pair of old socks and some rubbish on the floor we didn t have a do not disturb sign and one of the staff members walked on my boyfriend naked the toilet has a sliding door instead of a normal one which is not very romantic when you re traveling with your boyfriend plus it lets all the funny smell go in the room the staff was not that friendly as most of the reviews on booking com say the hotel is overpriced for what it offers
