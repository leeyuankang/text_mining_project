there aren t any wardrobes or shelves in the room just a few hangers we couldn t unpack and had to leave all our clothes in the luggages folded we stayed there for nights and the alarm of the hotel went off during the night many times times between am the fist night and twice around am the second night when we called the front desk they said that everything was under control first day the cleaning lady entered the room without knocking the door while i was changing my clothes with a small scream she shot the door back half an hour later i heard the same thing happening with the next door neighbour the bar was poor and either they didn t have some spirits or it took minutes to find where they put the bottles the floors are stone tiles so don t forget to take slippers with you this was one of the wost star hotel experiences
