this was a birthday trip away which the hotel were aware of we arrived to a small dirty room the next morning we found a pair of a previous customers pants in among the clean towels when reporting this to staff at reception we were asked to speak to different members of staff before someone decided to move us to another room not of these members of staff apologised nor was the inconvenience acknowledged this was not an inexpensive hotel and for what i paid i would have expected a lot more in terms of service and cleanliness extremely disappointed
