fire drill on the sunday morning was a bit of a nightmare we did not get told what was going on my friend was in the shower at the time i was in my pyjamas we both rushed out into the street there did not seem to be anyone in charge if someone had checked us off a list we could have gone for a coffee or a sit down in a caf i really appreciate fire drill have to be done and i am really glad they are but more organisation next time please
