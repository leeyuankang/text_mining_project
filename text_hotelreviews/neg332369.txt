view was terrible but that was not the reason for staying here so it can be overlooked i just felt underwhelmed by the whole experience there was nothing particularly wrong with anything staff were fine facilities were ok it was just that for the price i expected a bit more wow if you understand what i mean even for central london i have stayed at the cumberland a couple of times before and the experience seemed much better on those occasions
