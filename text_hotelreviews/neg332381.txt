its a traditional old shool hotel that is putting in no effort whatsoever because they know they will make money off the location regardless when we arrived there were only staff checking in guests and staff standing in the lobby doing nothing when we finally got served after in the queue we were interrupted by another guest complaining about his washing and the girl checking us in actually stopped serving us to attend to him the only reason she came back to serve was because i explicitly said to her that it was rude and poor service to attend to another guest while checking us in
