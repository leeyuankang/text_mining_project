i had made a request prior to travelling to check in early as it said it was possible on the booking com website there was a very good reason behind this as we were going to an event that started at and once we were in we weren t allowed to come out and back in we were told on arrival we couldn t check in early and would be put in a queue we checked back twice and the room still wasn t ready so had to leave our bags with concierge which was ok but we had to get changed in the toilets of the hotel and i felt rather embarrassed as the hotel was busy at about pm we had to leave our event early to get back and collect our bags and check in to our room
