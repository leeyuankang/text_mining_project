soulless reception area bit like an airport bed too close to the cupboard so couldn t pull out tea and kettle tray easily also momentus restaurant quite poor almost an hour between starter and main course arriving whole list of soft drinks on the menu which you no longer serve and waitress not at all apologetic seemed surprised that a mature women not happy with lemonade or coke also had to return chicken burger as stone cold but it came back still tepid but was so hungry i just ate it enormous queue and wait for breakfast also similar to an airport experience we gave up and went outside for breakfast even though we had already paid for it probably won t be returning in future
