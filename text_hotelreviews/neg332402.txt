breakfast we paid extra for breakfast when we went to eat the queue was so long we didn t have time so asked for our money back they kindly seated us in the club lounge for breakfast instead but the egg bacon tomato and mushrooms were stone cold and inedible there was no toast and choices not great no time to complain as by the time we d done all of that we had to leave also two receptionists one male and one female were lovely but another female receptionist was not friendly at all and not what i would expect from front of house staff
