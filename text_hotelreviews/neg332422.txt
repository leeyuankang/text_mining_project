the service has been gone down during days the reception couldn t make as second key to the room so we have to arrive with me partner always together tv didn t work during all stay telephone didn t work during all stay so there was not possible to call to room to room or other hotel numbers room service turned twin bed room to double bed room with one bed linen and blanket set which was totally unacceptable as i shared the room with my business partner and this was reason why i booked twin room instead double room to get extra blanket was taking almost an hour and i was forced to go down to the reception twice some how the general feeling was that staff don t care very much about the guests next time i will think seriously do i book this hotel anymore it is definitely not a service
