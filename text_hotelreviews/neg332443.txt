they only want you at the reception for check in for check out a guy came to the queue and took our roomcards and said you can leave now not allowed to enter the reception desk they want u to leave as fast as possible there was a security guy in the lobby who was a bit rude to people they want you to check your room card before you go to the lift if you dont the guy gets aggresif anyway u cant take the lift without a valid card so there s no point in checking your card twice its a hotel not a prison at our arrival we got a room that was poor small beds very uncompfy room not really cleaned we had to change it room was ok i didnt like the sink in the bathroom the view was poor backyard you can open the window about maybe windows are not transparent due to a self adhesive foil we had fire alarm in the morning no explications were given very noisy during our stay due to maintainence works we would not book the hotel again for that price its to expensive there are other star hotels that are much better than this one you should feel welcome during a hotel stay well there were moments we didnt the concierges are worth stars
