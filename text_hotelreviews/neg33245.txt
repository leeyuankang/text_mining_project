we had a room on the top floor and it was very small we had paid for a standard room but the room in the photo was not one of the ones on the top floor where you lose a lot of space because the roof slants in in the bathroom this meant that there is effectively no way to have a shower because you can barely sit up in the bath tub let alone stand there should be a lower price bracket for rooms on that top floor
