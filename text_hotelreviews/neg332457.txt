the standard double room would hardly qualify as a single room in most major hotels in europe the bathroom was absurdly small too the hotel says the rooms are decorated stylishly maybe in in the there s no gym on site the hotel is dated and the facilities are poor the hotel is catering to very large tour parties so it has the feel of an airport hotel it is over priced i was immensely irritated that i was not allowed to take my coffee in the morning from the breakfast room to the lobby to sit and drink there while reading the newspapers too many orders and instructions also did not like the security guards hanging around the whole time
