the attitude of the staff from the moment we arrived was awful huge dissonance between how nice the hotel itself is and how unfriendly and unhelpful the staff were for example there was some mix up in the booking so instead of a party of which i thought i booked for me and my two daughters the booking was only made for persons the extra bed which i was made to come down and pay for immediately like i was some kind of crook while leaving my two kids alone in the room was only finally brought up to the room at we were all so tired and frustrated really beyond ridiculous not even an apology offered disgusting i will never return to a place which treated us repeatedly so rude and unhelpful
