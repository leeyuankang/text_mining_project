the wifi was not working on my arrival the need for the connection was really important as i had to prepare a presentation for an important meeting i had to go out looking for an alternative to finish my work on tuesday night i reported the problem to the front desk unfortunately i was faced with someone who told me that was not the problem of the hotel although it is included in the offer of the room as a free service later one of the staff came to me as i was trying to send an email from one of the computers in the reception she expressed apology for the problem and told me that the on call manager assured her that i will get a discount for that unfortunately on my departure on saturday morning i was told by the reception that they had no record of the problem moreover the lady said that was not the problem of the hotel i asked to see the manager the receptionist came back to tell me t the manager offered to give me discount on my phone calls bill amounting to pounds i thanked her for the odder and told them not to take it out of my bill i thought that was an insult
