room in the basement while i clearly stipulate in my booking that i wanted a room on a high floor and not in the main building i have booked a deluxe room and as there was no more room of that category available when i arrived i have been upgraded to an executive room which made me wondering what would be a standard room because the executive one had nothing really executive the bathroom is very basic and not really fancy all in all the hotel is not bad but compared to other hotels in the same you understand why it s cheaper i might have been unlucky with the room i have received as i m often travelling to london i might try it again to confirm my words
