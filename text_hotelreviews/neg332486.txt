while very organised and efficient i felt the personality of the gentlemen at reception left a lot to be desired especially when the room including breakfast was over he told us he was giving us one of the better rooms with a view of the marble arch and park however when we got to our room it was an on street view to a convenience shop across the street disappointing as i was celebrating my birthday we said we would take the deluxe king size room however our room while very nice was very small and was no bigger than the usual standard double rooms that i have stayed in around the world there was only one chair so when breakfast was delivered to our room on a trolley table only one of us could eat at the table i ended up clearing off one of the bedside lockers to sit on not what i would have expected from such an establishment to conclude i wouldn t stay here again as i felt it was staggeringly over priced for the room we received and the service given
