even though we upgraded to a delux room it was so small didn t even have a proper wardrobe the room literally was the bed the hotel entrance on the other was a huge amount of empty space with nothing in it there was no character ambience nothing heard it s going to be a hard rock hotel it needs to sort it s identity as its nothing at the moment so disappointed after our wonderful stay at the mandeville last year fully booked could have had a much better place for the money but visited the hotel a few years ago for a drink and always wanted to stay nothing was the same though disappointing
