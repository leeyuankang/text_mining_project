hotel lobby is empty and unwelcoming no seating or staff on hand to help with cases etc there is an awful smell of damp throughout the hotel public areas are shabby and in need of renovation rooms were dirty and old bathrooms had not been cleaned properly from previous occupiers we did get moved to executive rooms but still the standard of this hotel s accommodation was well below what i expected for the price charged the only positive is the location direct onto oxford street marble arch
