booked a double room so expected a double room but it was the size of a single room with a very small double bed which was against a wall so the person sleeping near the wall had to bum crawl to the end of the bed to get out no common sense or imagination to create space in the room and looked like it was all put together in a rush our two sons had a twin room and it was bigger noticed my pillowcase had stains on it also my sons room had dirty water with bits appear from the plug hole in the sink the cleaner knocked on our door and entered at on the day we were leaving when you have a check out time of only one teabag each with loads of milk pots when two teabags each would be better first time we have been disappointed with a hotel it was a shame as we were celebrating our sons birthday
