cleanliness of the rooms very basic and mainly tiding up the beds and the bathroom no cleaning was done for a week the lobby do not have any chairs or sofas for people to sit on as used to be when you wait for some one downstairs you need to sit on a chair at least busy hotel so many times calling the reception or concierge takes very long time
