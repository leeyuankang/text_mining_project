this is not my first time in london always going hotels delays this hotel is very bad no consideration the price paid the team snobs and tougher all the time because of the lack of their professions i missed the airport in minutes i called s mercedes car and told them how much luggage i have after hsaoto arrived at am the driver said that would be enough for suitcases waited to bring a bigger car but unfortunately not at the level of the s and back off the same amount anyone looking for a place with a high quality of life then this is obviously not the hotel not recommend at all the hotel ruined my trip of nine days
