too many people hanging out in the lobby i didn t feel secure one or times saw drunk people having issues and the staff trying to calm them down the location is excellent but it s really noisy cars and people standing just outside hotel no sit area in the lobby rooms are small and that s fine except rooms located on the corner the staff are nice and trying to do the best but sometimes they can t follow up because hotel has too many rooms huge hotel next time i will not stay in this hotel because of noisy and crowded area
