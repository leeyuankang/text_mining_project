very poor customer service and managers did not bother to call back to ask about my complaint very noisy maintenance work you will need to shout to listen to your partner here is the full story it was like a joke i could not believe what has been going on for the last days i booked rooms in cumberland marble arch for me my wife baby and father inlaw we were given rooms and i will not be able to describe how loud and continuous is the drilling and maintenance noise for both thursday and friday its as if someone is drilling into your head you can t even listen to someone in the same room with out shouting its been the worst stay from me so far in london we had to keep leaving the hotel and just go and sit anywhere in the hydepark or oxford street i am not a fussy reviewer on thursday i thought it might be a one off essential repair but on friday i called the reception and asked them how long it will take barley can hear them from the noise they said its till o clock and yes it will be also all the day tomorrow saturday i was so grateful that we were leaving on saturday the reception offered me to come down and see if they can change our rooms but it was o clock already and our heads were exploding we could not even think of packing everything moving to another room and then leaving the following day the important question here if you were aware of this loud maintenance work why would you allocate these rooms i asked the reception to connect me to a manager to make a formal complaint and they said that he is dealing with a customer and will give me a call back of course no one bothered to call or do anything please note that i paid nearly to stay in a very noisy loud rooms where we can t even speak to each other in addition to the poor customer service from our management finally i submitted a formal complaint on their website and as usual no one bothered
