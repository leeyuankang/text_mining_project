very small wardrobe only enough for hangers small standard room but its the average hotels like this i had a bad leaking in my sink and when i called the maintenance they said we can t help you its fault with fixing the sink from the begining and i stayed nights with wet bathroom because of this our room is next to staff elavator and staff storage so it was alot of noises early morning also alot of noises coming from outside from the restoration of the hotel building and noise of cars and music outside if you had to book in this hotel please make sure dont take our room
