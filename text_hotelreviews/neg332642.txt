bed covers weren t dirty but weren t that clean as well a bit worn out i would say found red substance in my toilet bowl it wasn t that noticeable only when i lowered my head i could see it the variety of food in the executive lounge during breakfast was limited and the coffee machine didn t work occasionally however food was great very little space and shelves for clothes we had to leave everything inside our luggage for the whole days despite all that i genuinely enjoyed my stay and i d say i m more satisfied than dissatisfied staff were extremely nice and helpful i was transferred to another room on my request easily and efficiently the atmosphere of the whole place was good and met to my expectations
