we reached to our rooms however the room was dirty and they didn t clean it from the previous tents we called the reception to inform them with this situation however no one came even after half an hour and with several calls from us housekeeping didn t come until we went to the reception to complain the room was changed after waiting for more than half an hour our first impression of cumberland was not too impressive unfortunately it was disturbing to see an unclean room the biggest issue is that staff did not react very fast to sort out this issue
