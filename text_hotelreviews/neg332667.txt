booked a reg twin room but the receptionist said they only had an executive twin room available that turned out to be a very tiny crowded room for two people could barely move in it asked for an upper level room but was given a lower level room breakfast at the executive lounge had little choice of food than regular breakfast the hallways looked very dirty security was obnoxious my conclusion for this hotel the cheaper room you book the better offer you get this hotel is poorly maintained
