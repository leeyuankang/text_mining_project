this was my first time being blackmailed by the concierge to be fair almost all hotels have some kind of a rude staff but this staff took it to an all new level when i ordered dinner from a near by resturant the staff didn t want to bring it up to me and after explaining how that its his job he says it will get cold before it arrives to my room i went down to collect it from him he told me if i knew u already paid for it i was gonna bring it straight away i came to london for work and after along day i had to face this i payed gbp a night to buy my comfort not te get insulted
