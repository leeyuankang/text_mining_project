attitude of reception staff requested late check out and was told that they could extend pm i asked extension till pm with extra charge but was told that hotel fully booked and unable to extend it is impossible to believe that all guests will check in at pm if the hotel is fully booked and when i checked independently there were number of available rooms on that day so loss of revenue to the hotel due to poor room management also hotel arranged a taxi with no a c had to baked till i reach the airport
