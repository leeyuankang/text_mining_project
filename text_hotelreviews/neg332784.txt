very busy on the lifts and being the only method to access my room i was required to wait this took up to mins for a lift to become available for me the breakfast experience wasn t not good either we stood from our table to go and get coffee and pancakes only to come back to notice our table had been cleared and another couple had been sat at it the staff quickly relocated us to another table but due to this the rating will drop off
