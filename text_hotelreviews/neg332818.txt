this is a huge hotel that won t make you feel at home compared to other hotels in the area this place offers little value for money small rooms we had twin beds instead of one large one and we got lost twice in the endless corridors room doors leave plenty of light noise in lobby bar is uninspiring with a huge cold lobby to greet you
