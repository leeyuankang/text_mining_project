takeaway food and rubbish left in coridoor by visitors staying on floor it smelled awful and looked awful i did mention it to staff and some was taken away but another bag of curry takeaway lingered for hours and it was an awful smell and sight i did not like being amongst so many people wearing the veil which personally i found threatening and it would have been nice to be able to engage with ones fellow guests in lifts and around the hotel but it seems not possible to engage anyone in conversation when their faces are covered
