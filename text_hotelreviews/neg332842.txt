we were both a bit disappointed with our room it was a little underwelming from the pictures on the website also the bed side light wasn t working properly until i had a look and the bulb wasn t screwed in properly which i thought you may check also we ordered breakfast to our room on the last morning the breakfast was lovely however in the room service brochure it claims that you provide a range of pastries which we did not receive i did notice that it wasn t on the list that you collect from the door but i didn t understand why it was in the brochure if we were not entitled to them another slightly annoying thing was the shower which leaked and ran all over the floor which was quite inconvenient
