my husband and i last stayed here years ago and we often came here for christmas dances and balls we were so disappointed as the whole ambience and soul of this once grand hotel has been ripped out it now has a clinical utility and unfriendly look and feel about it we were upgraded to an executive room which was no better with regards to facilities or decor than a travelodge or premier inn the breakfast room was a mad busy bun fight and felt like a school canteen those that were serving didn t have great command of the english language which became a problem when those that were being served also spoke little english
