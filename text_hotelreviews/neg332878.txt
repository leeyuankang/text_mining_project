the room was small and the bed was not very comfortable we stayed for a week and the breakfast was the same everday with no changes in the buffet the fire alarm went on in the hotel and we called the reception and house keeping to find out what happened without response and no one was outside the room and had to leave the hotel fast in a very cold weather and stayed out for an hour and the hotel management didn t even compromised us with any thing for the inconvenient situation our room view was the building on the other side and we asked another room which we couldn t have as it was not available
