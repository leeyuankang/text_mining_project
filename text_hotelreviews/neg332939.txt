the room was soooo small like the smallest room ever and i asked the conceirge to keep my bag for one week because im going on a trip and coming back to the hotel so they charged me pounds for that while other cheaper and smaller hotels do it for free when i arrived to the hotel no one showed up to take my luggage so i carried them by my self from the taxi to my room on the floor
