i booked deluxe king room but the room was too small and no window view changed the room times and ended up to pay way more for the upgrade i think the reception does this on purpose so we pay extra beside this the shower door was not closing that every time i take a shower i create a mess at my bathroom the clothes cabinet is too small room lights are not that good room is almost dark
