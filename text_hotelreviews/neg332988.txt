the reception was a bit of a mess because there seemed to be very little organization at the front desk as guest would not really line up and just bud ahead and ignore the fact that there was a line the elevators in the hotel were also quite slow as sometimes it took quite awhile for the elevators to come however that could be attributed to the size of the hotel as it is somewhat large the fitness centre was not located in the hotel which would have been nice to know prior to booking however it is not that far away from the hotel the wifi was decent but could have worked a little better as sometimes it was a little slow the flat screen tv was not interactive so there seemed to be a few things that could be construed as a bit misleading in the hotels description
