i was going back to the hotel with my girlfriend at around am and one of the staff started asking me to show him my card and asked if my girlfriend was a guest and where is her card i felt like he was interrogating me and it was uncomfortable to be honest i didnt like how he talked to me and that really impacted my view of the hotel and staff he was borderline rude
