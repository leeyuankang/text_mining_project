breakfast was ok but really expensive and overpriced if you take a walk behind the neighborhood there are plenty of much cheaper options to enjoy a breakfast water for those who drink still water is a problem also as you can only have it really overpriced again from the fridge machine opposite the reception one night we got back to the hotel late in the evening the machine did not have any still water bottles and staff told us there wouldn t be any until next day we tried sparkling but it made us more thirsty so if you are staying at the hotel always have your still water with you
