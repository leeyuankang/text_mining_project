unfortunately there were a lot of unpleasent surprises first they insited me for the parking money in advance for all our stay in the moment i made the check in at other hotels i payed at the check out everything that was on the room second one was that every morning at am they started their construction site they are making a new wing of the hotel and there was awful noise from the excavator so if you wanted or not you had to get up at am at the breakfast i saw each day little bugs in the tea area in our check out day at am someone insisted knocking at the door housekeeping we told her to leave after that we tryed to sleep a little more but they started to do something at the below level that sounded like moving a lot of furniture check out was at not at it s a shame because the hotel looks ok and has a good position it would be great if things would be managed normally without noise bugs and with better client services
