we were there for three nights the tv was not working for even one second no matter how many times we complained they only sent someone to check but not to fix it we got a bar voucher for compensation but the guy at the bar said we could only get one drink we tried to use usb stick to watch our own movie from the tv and it works with a very loud voice really annoying it is not a four star hotel standard at all
