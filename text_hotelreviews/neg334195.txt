the lady at the reception during my check in took out a blank white paper and asked me to write some personal details like name address etc and wanted me to sign it this is the first time i get such a request in my multiple trips worldwide it was not professional at all i presume anything can be written on the paper with my signature at the end and i have the right to refuse doing that after about minutes of a bad attitude insistence from her side she got an existing contract and crossed the name and details then asked me to rewrite my details over eventually i agreed as at least it was on the hotel s letterhead other staff were all helpful and nice throughout my stay the water fossit was not properly located very close to the sink that i couldn t get my hand under the water the pictures of the hotel s front were not like the one in display the front entrance was too small
