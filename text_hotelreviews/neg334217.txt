the hotel wanted to charge me higher price for the room than was the price on my reservation the problem was with my breakfast included or not included and to say that my reservation is in another language so she is not able to verify my reservation was not very nice from the lady at the reception in the evening during my check in she did not even ask about my reservation number so she could check it online everything was fine except of process of check in and check out in that hotel
