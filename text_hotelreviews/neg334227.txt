we arrived late in the evening and were given a room on the ground floor as it tourned out it was a room for disabled persons connected to the next room through a door and we heard everything our neighbours were saying furthermore the tv wasn t working and upon drawing the staff s attention our room was changed but unfortunately with a single room i didn t protest i m not a troublemaker but it seemed lousy and unfair on their part
