the worst service and personel ever totally worthless quality i m used to international travels and i have never experienced so bad bad bad and unwilling personel not service minded at all unpleasant it was difficult to sleep since doors to the room seem to let all the sounds in you could as well leave it open plus seems to be some funky guests and neighbors tried to leave open windows but then i got to listen to some sex noises instead just pitiful and why would they keep your room clean or fill in coffee capsules and do not expect to get a bit earlier check in even if you re sick or pregnant or whatever they will not offer you that extra hour of hospitality of extra care plain no no to everything totally wortless i seldom provide feedback regarding my stays but this place was so exceptionally bad so it s important that other people avoid it
