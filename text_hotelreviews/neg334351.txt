i arrived at the hotel in the evening i was the only person at reception and was not acknowledged by the receptionist who was too busy tending to some papers she knew i was there but left me waiting that s fine i know people are busy sometimes but an acknowledgement to say she would be with me in a moment would have been appreciated once i was acknowledged and asked for my check in details i did not feel like i was made welcome at all not even a smile if anything i felt like i had done something wrong by even being in the hotel in the first place such was the sour look on the face of the receptionist having been to my room i tried to use the safe but could not unlock it on the way out of the hotel i asked the same receptionist if someone could take a look at the safe for me as i could not open it again i received a sour look and some muttering i didn t understand as i do not speak austrian i told her not to worry about it and i will ask the night porter upon my return who i would like to add was a delight and very nice man what i am used to in hotels the complete opposite of the person i am complaining about maybe she was having a bad day who knows still unacceptable as this is the hospitality industry and i have paid good money for this experience
