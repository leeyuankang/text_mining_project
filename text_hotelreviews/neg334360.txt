hotel vienna is overall supposed to be viennese semi luxury but actually it is totally outdated with some s updates which makes it even worst in terms of deco style and appearance the corridors are with heavy old carpets and smell although there is no smoking looks like no one follows the rules even the staff only small lift for cutest and staff which is slow and smells all the time the rooms are not as spacious as it looks on the photos advertised they have used the usual advertisements tricks the coffe and tea advertised as complimentary are just one off after that if you whant to have every day you need to pay for it there is a coffeemaker and a kettle too the mini bar is totally overpriced the cleaning services are daily but if you whant your bedding and towering change you need to ask for it the heating is very hot you need to adgest it yourself or ask receptionist they are no guides for it there are no wardrobes but more like a small box with few hangers chair and small stool in luxury double room which we had the bathroom has no air conditioner and the baths are outdated with shower facing the wrong way the hairdryer is from the s and makes such a nose that is scary to use the rooms are with thin wals and you can prakticly hear everything in your naibour rooms if you are lucky and get a room next to the flying stewards you will get lots of different noises all night long tv is smal and programs only local not even an international news channels internet if working most of the time but kind of slow practically not for business use we spend days over christmas and new year and expected a bit more from the food menu since it was a festive season unfortunately the breakfast was the same and overpriced and lunch diner was not worth it
