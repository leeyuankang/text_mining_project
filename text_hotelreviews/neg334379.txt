we stayed nights in hotel vienna while the hotel was non smoking the hallways were definitively imbibed with thick tobacco smell it was hot and there was no air conditioning street was pretty noisy especially during the night and early morning the big let down for us was the staff s handling of our reservation for a bus trip to salzburg which they recommended btw we were told that everything was taken care of but the shuttle never came to pick us up from the hotel we were left in the cold to wait for the shuttle at am by am we gave up and went back inside the person at the desk was clueless we debugged with them later to find out that the staff we spoke with initially left a message for next staff to ask us for payment and complete the reservation which never happened and we were never told ahead of the supposed trip it was the last full day of our stay in vienna and we did not have time and means to make alternative plans for visiting salzburg so we missed it
