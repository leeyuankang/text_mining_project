i had a single room which was not good at all it was very warm no air conditioning it was very noisy i had a room in front of the street and i could hear the cars and people talking when you are trying to sleep you are laying with your head next to the shower which is a glass cage you can hear the ventilation system of the bathroom the entire night it was a high zoom sound in sum this was not a star room at all you can find better for your money
