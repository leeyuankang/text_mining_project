it s not my first stay in this hotel but chances are it is the last one i always liked this hotel because it s close from the metro station and you can reach the center in mins and rooms are big and nicely designed however this time all of three rooms we got terribly smelled like cigarettes staff started to open doors with their keys without knocking and break in more than one hour before checkout not really comfortable moment also because bathroom walls are transparent lady from the reception called one room and yelled at the guest to check out and a bit later she realized that that guest has a booking for another period and called to apologize quality of this hotel dropped down and nothing but a bottle of sparkling wine on the breakfast table reminds of star rating anymore
