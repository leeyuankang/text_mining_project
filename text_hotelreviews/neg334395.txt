the description mentioned parking facilities but both we and any other guests who we overheard while they were checking in were told that their own parking garage was full awkward considering there wasn t anyone else at breakfast we usually take very long breakfasts and their solution was to leave the car in a deserted tank station nearby the receptionists demanded eur for leaving the card in the former tank station which doesn t have any lighting btw but after explaining that we were only checked in for roughly hours checked in at o clock left at morning the next day he agreed that we d pay eur only here s the caveat the parking costs still eur per day weren t added to the invoice and we didn t receive any receipt for it either because a friend of the hotel is in charge of the ex tank station s facility the entire eastern european like completely illegal fiscally speaking approach left us with a very unpleasant opinion about the hotel s staff considering we explicitly asked for parking when we made the reservation i d expect something less out of the ordinary
