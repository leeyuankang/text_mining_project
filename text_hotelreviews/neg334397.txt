we had a really rough time here sleeping due to the continuous smell of smoking in the hotel this is a non smoking hotel but apparently when we raised the issue we were told the owner was the only one that could smoke here it meant that one if us couldn t sleep as had asthma and was anxious for an asthma attack due to the heavy smell we were coughing and spluttering at one point and were glad to be out of the hotel most of the day we did raise the issue and later there was a air freshener added to the bathroom but this made no difference also on our trip we asked for hot water and a cup to take some medicine and were told this isn t what you expect from a star hotel this is behaviour more for a youth hostel this was deemed very impolite and personal some of the staff were very nice but evening staff on a couple of occasions were abrupt and rude
