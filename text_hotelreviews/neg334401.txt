the prater subway and train station area is a magnet for homeless people drug addicts and all sort of dubious people the bathroom does not have a door it s just a glass slider and it makes it less comfortable than what you would expect the hotel does not have an ac unit and all the tv channels are in german i would expect to have at least in english for tourists to enjoy breakfast is fairly poor but the restaurant looks nice
