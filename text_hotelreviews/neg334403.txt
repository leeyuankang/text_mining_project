i wouldn t have rated this as a four star hotel the bathroom in a twin bedroon was all glass which was a bit awkward between friends the nearest station pratastern felt unsafe to walk back from at night as a female as there are constant congregations of groups of men drinking alcohol outside of it my friend was followed by a drunk man whilst walking back alone in the afternoon who only stopped when she walked into a nearby hotel to ask for help
