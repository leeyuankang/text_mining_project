the staff is horrible i needed a parking place i ve asked for one when i booked the room i never got feedback and when i ve got there they told me they don t have one the lady was even irritated that she had to do several tasks in parallel including answer me where i could park i had to park in a station nearby as you look around this hotel is located near prater but if you go for a walk you will see that it s not that pleasant location nor did it look very safe to me moreover when i came later for check in i arrived earlier then expected i had again to wait to see the stuff finish their stories with other guests and sending away a guest who was complaining for the smell in room what i would also add is the fact that it has no air conditioning and at degrees outside during day i felt that lack during otherwise the hotel is ok but the stuff is a nightmare
