vienna was in the middle of a heatwave when we arrived and this hotel doesn t have air conditioning so it was very hot and stuffy we ended up going somewhere else even though we d already paid for our stay here because we were very uncomfortable the room also wasn t particularly clean really this is an old fashioned cheap hotel that s been partially modernised in order to fulfill the minimum requirements to be able to call itself a four star hotel but it still feels like an old fashioned cheap hotel
