basic dull interior with no class entrance and foyer not to my taste and long dull carpeted corridors with gloomy feel i feel the best rooms are not a available especially second and third floors as when i requested one i was told they were all taken after a long walk i looked over from the square and no lights on any aforementioned floors this hotel is cheap and the only recommendation is location which is ideal for mount street and carlos place my upgraded room felt like a compromise based on my ability to confront and assert my protest at first accommodation offered the original rate of this is oom was all i can say is to this corporate rip off is in your dreams and go to the connaught round the corner and learn about style i paid and would say it was worth at best only for location beware of special offers the prices are slashed as a honey trap no breakfast included and felt ripped off next time i will check out a hotel a mile or so away as this hotel is playing on bygone reputation and ripping off decent people who expect to feel charmed and satisfied will not return
