even though we thought the marriott was good there were a few items to raise the lighting in the room was dull it was often hard to see even with all the bed lamps on the hot water in the shower constantly went from hot to cold which is somewhat annoying a few more tea bags would have been appreciated it seemed that you were on rashions the breakfast each morning always seemed odd the first morning you had one of us scheduled upstairs and the other downstairs even though the breakfast was good it seemed the overall operations of staff seemed out of service eg one morning we had a pot of tea but the others it was by cup by cup it seem that some staff were there to serve but not clear and on our final morning there was no orange juice yogurt or fresh fruit available unless i wanted to wait come on i think this area needs attention and forget about the executive lounge it s not a lounge that i have experienced before
