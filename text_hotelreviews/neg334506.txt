bathroom very small and only a shower on booking in we had asked if we could get a drink and were told our room was ready and it had tea and coffee facilities as the room was ready we took his offer up although at the time i thought it strange he hadn t mentioned a lounge area see further other than a few chairs in front of reception when we went to the bar on the saturday we were asked if we had booked a table not what you expect in a hotel on the sunday evening we returned to hotel for a drink prior to leaving only to find the bar shut we then asked for a cup of tea only to be asked if we were members of the club lounge where we could get a drink or food we said we weren t and were told we could join but it would cost if we weren t members we then learnt that the restaurant and bar are not owned by the hotel and that we could get a drink in the restaurant if we had a meal and that the bar was closed on sundays lady was very pleasant and made us a cup of tea in a paper cup and presented in a paper bag as that was all that was on offer i thought we were in starbucks at that moment not a five star hotel in a prime location of london it transpires that normal offerings of a star hotel or less of a lounge with the availability of drinks and snacks is not available at the marriott unless you are a member of their club lounge or pay also breakfast was ok but not a massive choice especially of fruit we were then billed for each individual item we had even though breakfast was included in the room rate and we then had to sort that out
