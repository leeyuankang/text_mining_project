hhmmm our booking included breakfast however we opted out and on the recommendation of a friend we went to dishoom on kingly street on the morning fabulous the second morning we went down to breakfast in the hotel the selection of pastries and cereals etc was good the staff are polite and efficient but the cooked breakfast was a shocker we eat at michelin restaurants and greasy spoons and we love both but this was awful i sent back my fried eggs because they were not cooked the second attempt was better but they were still a properly cooked yoke floating on a raft of slime the bacon wasn t much better sadly
