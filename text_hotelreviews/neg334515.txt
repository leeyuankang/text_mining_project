disappointing hot breakfast the tomatoes were a little dry and the poached eggs were luke warm at best i also don t see why i have to make my own toast and try and time it to be hot with the arrival of my cooked breakfast i got lucky with the timing and at least the hot toast counter balanced my luke warm eggs coffee and fresh oj were first class i did message the hotel via booking com to request an earlier check in but received no reply this was no great problem and we received a text message advising of availability a short while before the official check in time
