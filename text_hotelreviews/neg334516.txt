as chairman of a trade association together with ceos we got back to the hotel after dinner at and asked where we could have a drink we were shown to the hotel bar and then told all the tables a lot of which were empty were reserved and we were not allowed to stand the duty manager thomas then confirmed that we could not have a drink in the hotel unless we used the minibars in our room and we had to go to the restaurant next door which at least allowed us one drink before they closed i have never known a large chain hotel refuse guests a drink and we were certainly not rowdy the end result is that six large companies will now be instructing their employees to avoid the marriott well done thomas
