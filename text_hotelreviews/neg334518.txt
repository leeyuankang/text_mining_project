ok we arrived before the check in time we had rooms booked and they gave us and we had to wait hour before the other was ready as it was being cleaned except that it wasnt and another guest was given a room while we waited when we did get in there were boards on the bed which surely should have been removed beforehand so we waited while someone came t remove them apart from the dirty cup everything else wasd fine
