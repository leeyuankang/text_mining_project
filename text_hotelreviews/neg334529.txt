the bathroom was very small and slightly awkward getting in the shower as the room was very tight people would not fit in there i had some issues ringing down to reception and room service no answer after mins got hold of concierge also no free wifi you have to pay which is not the norm now for hotels for the rate per night you would expect free wifi
