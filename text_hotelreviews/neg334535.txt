the staff tried to charge for wifi this seemed like an attempt to add a charge on a high priced room that they thought we wouldn t spot the staff just weren t up to scratch for a hotel in this price bracket they called me late and night and were really unhelpful they didn t show any initiative and our guest ended up without any breakfast as he had to leave early in spite of the fact we d paid for it i ve had better service in a premiere inn
