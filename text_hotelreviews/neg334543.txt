the travel cot offered to my month old baby only had the thin hard base mattress it comes with very very disappointing as expected a good quality mattress and asked for one in my booking request which was obviously ignored if the hotel had read it they should have got in touch with me to inform me that they did could not supply a decent travel cot mattress it is unforgivable that i had no choice but to let my baby sleep on this horrible base especially since we were in london for night for his birthday and he had not been well and had fever since the day before our arrival he tossed and turned all night not because he was unwell he is a good sleeper and actually sleeps better when he has fever and i should know as he has suffered from fever lots of times but because he is used to a luxury mattress at home also baby food could not be warmed up in the restaurant so had to offer my baby his lunch at room temperature for the first time in his life which was too cold for him and he refused it this upset me enormously
