for what is meant to be a star property the property is run down and in need of serious upgrade of the room decor simple things like curtains on proper tracks that open close with ease would be a good start hence i think the hotel is over priced when you take room quality into account i have often stayed at the marriott canary wharf and that property is in much better shape service was also limited i had an airport transfer booked through the hotel but had to juggle my own luggage through reception and out the doors no staff to be seen anywhere the driver came in from the street to assist
