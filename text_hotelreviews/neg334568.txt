i ve stayed here before for one night can t remember what kind of room was it but it was with wooden floor and large windows with garden view which was great however i booked last october for the king room which suppose to be the biggest out of their rooms and it was just bad on so many levels it was carpet rather than wooden floor but felt dusty bathroom felt so old and not a five star bathrooms at all asked for extra bedsheets and then got the bedsheets wrapped with someone jacket inside of it it was bad experience all together never staying here again
