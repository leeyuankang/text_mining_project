cleanliness of the room our first room had black hair on the bedsheets lack of cleanliness for a star hotel is unacceptable particular when we were paying aud per night the room was also incredibly dark the only lighting were lamps with no ceiling lights even the larger rooms still had a very small bathroom with limited ventilation and none of the usual amenities like cotton wool i was also suprised that there was no complimentary bottled water in the room again this is unusual for a star hotel the club room was on the lower ground floor which again seemed unusual as there was no view and it seemed quite claustrophobic we had breakfast included in our room rate the breakfast was quite basic cereal small bowl of fruit salad amd yoghurts cheese and some pastries and bread with limited hot food eggs a couple of the waitstaff at the maze restaurant where the breakfast is served were quite unfriendly and rude this included one of the junior managers on duty young brunette lady i witnessed one of the waitstaff turn away guests for breakfast who arrived a couple of minutes after breakfast was to finish at even though there was still all the food on the buffet table the hotel lifts were incredibly slow and old sometimes stopping on each floor even when the floor number hadn t been pressed in the lift and there was no one waiting when you got to the floor one of the positives of the hotel was its manager on duty pedro when we contacted the front desk in relation to the hair on the sheets pedro was incredibly helpful and professional promptly relocating us to another room on a higher floor with a view of grosvenor square
