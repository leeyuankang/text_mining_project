breakfast at the maze grill was not very nice the service was poor unfriendly staff food quality was below average and slow and most important to me the grill was very run down with old and dirty furniture i wanted to invite some friends over for a meal but changed my mind as i would be ashamed to invite them to such a place this is star venue don t understand why gordon ramsey lend his name to this restaurant
