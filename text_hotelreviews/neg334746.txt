when we arrived at the hotel the staff was very unfriendly but we thought perhaps they were very busy then i have a wife of indian background while i am white myself after my wife spoke to the receptionist the lady pretended not to have known about our reservation and not a smidgen of smile or welcoming attitude only when i came to the desk to ask what was he hold up suddenly everything as ok the amount of security checks proving who we are and documents we had to produce to be given the key was beyond insane we didn t get this much questions at the border control on our way back in the morning instead of greetings like when you see your guest and say good morning there was this ever so present silent treatment and disapproving stares i actually came up to the reception desk to say if everything was ok and then joked with the receptionist that he should smile more he didn t find it funny though we ve had a dog with us and we were told that we d have to pay euros extra per night for the dog normally it is euros in any german hotel for comparison the room was ok but the bathroom wasn t safe to use as the barrier from the shower to the rest of the bathroom was leaking and looked like a little swimming pool after i took a shower very dangerous if you re not standing firm on your feet overall the sleep and room itself wasn t bad at all but the attitude of the staff was beyond appalling with clear not even subtle racist attitude towards my wife we will never ever return there and i would like to strongly recommend to all non white guests save yourself the bother and find somewhere else this place will not welcome you sadly
