on hindsight we would have paid a bit more to stay somewhere more central elaboration parking at this hotel was per night not exactly cheap but because the hotel was not that near to city center and we didn t want to take public transport we drove out parking in city centre was not cheap either and we paid another for parking it was time consuming to find an empty parking lot in the city too so we say unless you re ready to take public transport choose somewhere more central and leave your car at the hotel
