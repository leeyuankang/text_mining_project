we booked a double room with a double bed for me and my wife and we got separate beds linked together which was very unpleasant and i told them from the beginning but they haven t done anything about this the wireless connection in our room was so weak we couldn t use it at all we had to go near the lifts to have wireless connection and again i told to the staff the situation but they haven t take any action only verbally they said will solve it but no action taken we found hair on the sheets when we arrived but after telling them they ve change the sheets
