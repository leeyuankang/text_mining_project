i bought a double room but hotel provided me a twin room and they told me they have sold out double rooms they either sell something that they don t have or sell your room if they have another client and give you another room which does not fit your requests normally they shouldn t charge me for the room and the excuse was so weird they simply defended that they have no free double rooms and they ignored that i bought a double room
