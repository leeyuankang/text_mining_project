i didn t like the fact that the double room had beds rather than but this was just a minor niggle regarding the area because it is in a more local neighborhood it was difficult to communicate with staff at local restaurants cafes etc outside of the hotel as they had little to no english i also found some the locals to be quite rude and stared quite a bit all the taxi drivers were extremely rude and no consistency with prices this is more a problem with barcelona and not the hotel also pickpockets are rife in the tourist areas
