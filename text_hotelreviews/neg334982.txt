air con in room was broken which made the room so hot once we opened the window we then couldnt really sleep due to how noisy traffic and passers by were curtains are really thin also so it feels like people can see in if you have the light on and it is light during the night due to street lamps breakfast was lovely the selection however the hot section wasnt kept heated we were the first down in the morning and it was already cold couldnt really enjoy totally cold egg sausages mushrooms etc i d also say it s a bit pricey pp
