one afternoon we went back for a small rest one male cleaner was just finishing our room after he left we took a shower in about mins two female cleaners opened our door without knocking when we still had no clothing on lots of screaming as you can imagine the day after we put do not disturb sign on our door they still came to clean our room when we came back the second room card was gone so we had to inform the hotel they were very concerned and made no fuss about the lost room card the above two events together made us feel like there was no privacy no sense of safety our room has a extra door which is not sealed and probably leads to the neighboring room a bit freaky ac as lots of people mentioned is way too warm and no way to adjust the temperature too hot that one can not sleep well in the night
