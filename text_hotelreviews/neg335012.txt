although there is unlimited access to tea coffee in the lounge area they don t have any in the room iron has to be requested for heating function is basic bathroom looked tired and not as clean the bed is a generous size but it doesn t have a duvet simply had a thin cover like a bed sheet which i thought was odd breakfast very basic indeed not worth paying for i was surprised it had such a high rating i personally wouldn t return and it s not a star outfit it s a star venue at best transport links are good but away from all the key places overall it was an average experience
