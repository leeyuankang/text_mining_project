i still wonder how this could be a star hotel it is the worse i have ever seen and overall a star hotel would be much better it was lacking cleaning the toillet had dark spots the tub was with mold the bathroom floor was not wet clean for long there was not enough light in the bathroom so it was hard to shave your legs or put on some make up there were so many things missing to a star hotel including the gym we have booked this hotel room because it was bigger than the average rooms in the other hotels but we were surprised to see it was actually much smaller i believe they count the bathroom area while the other hotels don t basically we had to cm around our bed and that was all the amenities were awful i ended up buying my own shower gel i will never book this hotel again and i would also advise everyone to stay away if they expect to get a star comfort it is simply not fair
