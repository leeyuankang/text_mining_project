we walked in and there were two insects in the bathroom not a really big deal the bed was very creeky and was so loud it would wake me up so i had to try to stay still when we slept the safe wasn t working either and we were really didn t have time to wait around for it to be fixed so we locked out important belongings in our suitcase on the last night the internet wasn t workin get my husband called reception who explained to keep trying it might start working not satisfied with this i called back and was told that the problem had been reported but they could do nothing else apparently their internet worked because their computer was connected to the internet via a wire but the wifi wasn t working ok i was annoyed but not the end of the world i went on to ask for some more water we had received a bottle on our first day but it hasn t been replenished i was told it was a welcome gift and if i wanted anymore water i had to come to reception and use a communal tap or take the bottles from the ridiculously overpriced mini bar i asked whether wifi was a gift too as that only seemed to work properly for one day not sensing the sarcasim the evening receptionist was incredibly rude and did not try to solve the issue at hand i told him i would be writing a negative negative review and he didn t seem to mind a word of warning to the owners employ staff with some compassion and business sense a small bottle of water costs you pennies but the refusal to supply anymore water remember this is a hotel has made me remember all the other faults on this hotel post a negative review and ensure none of my family or friends never return
