this boutique hotel doesn t compare to any other star hotel we ve stayed in the facilities resemble maybe a no proper facilities really at all i had emailed for a double bed and it was confirmed this was not the case on arrival and it had to be changed the bed was singles pushed together and thy didn t fit together properly so i ended up falling into the gap most of the night which may sound amusing to some but i can assure you this was not a recipe for a good nights sleep we were awoken at am by very loud banging and drilling as there is major building work going on right next door in fact was right across from our room and vein with earplugs the noise was beyond acceptable there should be a warning on the website as if we would have known about the noise we would never have booked this hotel i kind of f el like we have been a little duped
