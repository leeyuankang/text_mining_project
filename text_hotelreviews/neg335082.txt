most of the rooms had shaded or non transparent windows which makes you feel claustrophobic i have never seen any hotel s window like that for the price that is not acceptable and if they wouldn t have changed the room i wouldn t stayed there even if i had to pay for another hotel i would have been gone but my freinds endured it but unhappy plus the hair dryer was just a blowe over all i would not go there again
