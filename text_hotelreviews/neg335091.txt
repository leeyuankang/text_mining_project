it is classed as a star hotel and says that the rooms are sound proofed but yet the pillows were so soft it was pointless even having them and we could hear the people in the room next door talking and when they opened and closed their door our room shook then when we asked to change room the staff said they would come and tell us if it was possible but never came to tell us the room was so cold and when we asked to ow to turn the heat up they told us it wasnt possible as its an old hotel on one system and so from march to october it is set to cool and can t be changed the vending machine was empty every day of our day stay if this was a star hotel i d be ok but we booked and paid for a three stay and this is anything but
