we stayed on the first floor and could hear guest walking down the corridor late at night early morning the noise did not bother us too much as we were heavy sleepers but might be an issue for light sleepers however i would stay at the hotel again due to the friendly staff convenient location there s a few patisseries located down the same street near the hotel
