the bathroom wasn t clean all the towels had stains on it and weren t of good quality the sheets had little holes in it i didn t expect that in a hotel as for the breakfast it was okay the food was fresh but they didn t have a great variety maybe they didn t like to waste but for example they didn t have yogurt little things that could be improved
