we booked a family room adults and children and we should pay extra breakfast for our year old daughter wtf and for that euro extra the breakfast was very poor bathroom was quite small only one type of soap usually a star hotel offers much more too pricey for that kind of offer located quite far from the city center so you would travel a lot and vienna is very crowded if you travel with your car
