we had room at floor with exit to the entrance roof light in the toilette didn t work or let s say it was like a lottery one time it works next time no it is stars hotel in one of most expensive and beautiful cities in europe but it has insects that are absent in even no stars hotels and hostels we left a pack of cheese in the evening in bathroom next morning i found huge army of ants who went from somewhere under the carpet to this cheese and back i didn t want to come in in this bathroom any more i mentioned a net and spider in the dark corner and i would say it lives there and hunts these ants we were not the first guests who faced these habitants i suggest everyone to think whether to go there or not and not to leave any food in the room
