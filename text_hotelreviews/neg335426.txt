the tramway station to the city center is not very easy to find we strongly recommend to other guests to go by car to the city since the cost for the travel by tram euros one way is from far higher than the fuel plus the parking costs in the downtown especially if you are more than people i suggest therefore to the hotel employees to tell this information to other guests we were afraid not to loose the parking place the last available in the moment when we arrived it s annoying to see a lot of free places marked as vip while for the common people the parking was completely full
