when i arrived late in the evening they just told me they had given away the room put me into a taxi and sent me to another bad hotel in another part of town where i did not want to be but only after they forced me to pay the invoice for the room which i never saw which i had to accept because i did not have anywhere else to go they had my phone number and e mail so they could have asked me at any time if i were going to show up which by the way i always did every single time i booked there since i have an important client just mext door but they did not after very little sleep i had to get up earlier the next day and take a taxi which i obviously had to pay for myself to reach my client where i spent the rest of the day fighting against headaches and exhaustion courtesy of this appalling establishment
