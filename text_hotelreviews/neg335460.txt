this is not the first time when i was there but this time it was so different starting with receving the keys from one old appartment on the floor changing the key for another appartment where i ve found a very dirty chair with food for young babies inside the breakfast poor this time my opinion is that they have to improve a little bit the cleaning services to renovate the rooms from all the floors and the breakfast should have more than sausages or croissants
