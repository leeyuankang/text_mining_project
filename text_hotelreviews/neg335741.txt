parking was a horrific problem the staff were very unhelpful when it came to finding parking in the city when we first pulled up the staff told us that we could not park in front of the hotel as it was only for taxis we rushed like crazy to move and avoid getting a ticket but the staff did not give us clear instructions to the parking garage across town so it took us twenty minutes to find it then we had to walk back over half a mile to the hotel we later found out we would not have gotten a ticket immediately as it is possible to use the street for loading and unloading if it s late at night or early in the morning it was a case of many hotel staff telling us different things and none of them having enough fluency in english to explain anything to us properly it was a very complicated process finding the room also the building has a courtyard in the center that opens up to the street it was not kept up well either so it was not very secure our room was in a cluster where you needed a key to get into the cluster of four rooms and then you had to use the same key to unlock the room itself there was only one key for each room and the hotel required you to return the key to the front desk every time you left the hotel this was a very inefficient system that did not seem the most secure either the elevator could not keep up with the amount of people staying there and once you get to your floor there are of course more steps to go up to the actual room so this hotel was far from being disability friendly or even suitcase friendly in terms of the room the bathroom was filthy and could use a full remodeling the fixtures were ancient and rusty and there was dirt mold along the shower the beds were also uncomfortable which should not be the case for such an expensive room even the coffee machine was broken in the room the only benefit was that the bedding and towels were pretty clean
