this was the worst hotel i ve ever encountered in all my years with booking com rated it is more like a hostel a relatively nice reception invokes a false sense of security the external lift to the rooms is a portal to what can best be described as a house of horrors in terms of design hygiene and comfort or rather the distinctive lack of all three concepts the actual corridors and rooms leave everything to be desired filthy carpets on corridors and bedrooms chipped paint and screw holes in walls creased mismatched nylon curtains hanging from the windows like rags dust everywhere no toiletries in bathroom tv on table adjacent to beds didn t wait to see if it worked and even if it did one could not see it from either beds or chair extremely noisy extractor fan in bathroom creased cover on bedroom chair cheap uncomfortable mattress on beds and furniture table that best belongs on a skip really awful we checked out and did not even stay for one night the entire building needs a good cleaning and total refurbishment
