the viennese ambiance is there but the hotel itself lobby excluded needs a little revamp moquette with faded colors tiny oldish bathroom old window frames that didn t close properly though this didn t affect sleep quality furthermore in a hotel one would expect to find some toiletry especially if you travel for business and do not want to bring your whole beauty case for one night only a kettle for quick room tea or coffee and other little amenities that would make your stay just perfect to conclude to be a real hotel some adjustments are recommended to happily marry viennese style and modern comfort
