we found the pillows far too soft and had to wait till the morning after we mentioned it to get a spare pillow as the spares had all been allocated for the day was not impressed with the attitude of one female member of breakfast staff prau when the fresh waffle i was cooking got stuck on the griddle pan she was not happy and continued to make negative comments my husband overheard comments by another member of staff that oil should have been put out on the breakfast table to prevent this i found the whole experience distressing and just stuck to cold foods as the toaster was not put out on this morning either
