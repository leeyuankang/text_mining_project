the price was high and i thought i would have at least a fair quality for the money paid the hotel is rated star and i hardly can give it star well it was at same quality as london b b and maybe less the place was dirty i found traces of cockroaches wings on my room floor and it has only one elevator and there is no parking for the car it was a bad experience i don t recommend anyone to stay there
