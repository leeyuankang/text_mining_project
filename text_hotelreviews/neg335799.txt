minor details but there was a bag of peanuts and biscuits on the tray which appeared to be complimentary but weren t we didn t touch the minibar but were still still charged excessively for a bag of peanuts the room was at the front and was a tad noisy as we had to have the windows open as so hot july shut was much quieter would recommend requesting a room other than the front if visiting in the summer
