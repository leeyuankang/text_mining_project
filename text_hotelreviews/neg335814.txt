we all got very surprised when we got there the reception was very hot the hallways of the hotel are dirty and shaky the family room was spacious but there was a chandelier on top of the sleeper sofa which didn t seem very sturdy it looked like it could fall on top of my son s head we had to move the sofa but it ended up being extremely uncomfortable my husband and sons had to sleep on the king size bed while i slept on a twin bed no way that is a star hotel
