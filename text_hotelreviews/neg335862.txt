be aware that there is no air conditioning the room got a bit hot and you can t leave the windows or the curtains open because there is a walkway completely around the inner courtyard luckily there is a fan in the room as with most hotels now there is no clock in the room also the hairdryer is annoying you have to hold the button down constantly in order for it to work
