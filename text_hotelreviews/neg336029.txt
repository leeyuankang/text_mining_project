i find the price a bit too high the room could use a big mirror and a trash bin in the bathroom the toilet paper supports were mounted wrong the reserve one that should be vertical and needs no stopper was mounted instead of the current one horizontally and the lack of a stopper made the toilet paper fall each time i tried to use it the current support that should be horizontal and had a stopper was mounted vertically instead of the reserve one so the stopper was useless anyway the cap of the shower switch was missing which confused me about its usage considering the high price one would expect a flawless room but all big pluses compensated the minuses for me and i will be back for sure next time
