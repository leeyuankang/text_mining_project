my bed had no headboard and wasn t against a wall so i couldn t really read or watch tv in bed also the shower was not enclosed in a room of its own and was close to the window even though i had the curtains closed people could still have seen me in the shower i ended up putting a bag against the wall and the curtain so nobody could see in
