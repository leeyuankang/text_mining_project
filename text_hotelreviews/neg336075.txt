breakfast limited but i have always problem since i dont eat meat or dairy would love if hotels include more things for people with alergies or generaly more healthy choices but it is for hotels in general not specificly this hotel my room was a bit dark because it was facing inside of the building but it was single room so i know they had to use that space for a room
