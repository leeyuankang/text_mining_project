this stay was part of a christmas surprise for my husband and i had paid in advance because of this so it was more than annoying for him to be presented with a bill for an optional service charge as we left he was too polite to protest and spoil the occasion but i was really irritated a hotel at this level should not need to tack on this tacky charge it totally spoils the overall impression of their service which is otherwise excellent
