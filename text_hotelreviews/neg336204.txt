the room was very average not renovated as shown on booking com that being said the room was very clean cozy also anyone ft tall would find the shower impossible as the ceiling is very low slanted please note i hate to even mention these negative comments because the hotel itself and staff were absolutely extradionary i would definitely stay here again but i ll upgrade in room selection
