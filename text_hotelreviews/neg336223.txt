female staff at the front desk were like statues need a great deal of training in hospitality the night room service options were very disappointing and consisted of only three choices thai green curry onion soup or selection of pot luck finger sandwiches nothing could be tailored to order overall i found the service to be extremely lacking and would not recommend on this basis
