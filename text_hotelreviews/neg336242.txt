beware of the annex we were put in an annex room that you cannot access via the hotel the room was small but nice enough it felt more like staff quarters and you did not have the ambiance or even the staff access as you would in the hotels main building as such everything has to be done by coming back onto the street and coming back into the main building this is fair enough if it was a cheap room but at close on for one night you would expect more much more hence its not good value at all if they offer you the annex refuse in fact before you arrive email them and say you do not want one of these rooms as it spoils your experience i stay in london every week and was hoping this would be my regular but i don t think it will be
