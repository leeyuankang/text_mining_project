room was a bit small having the bed and lounge room combined all in one was very cramped maids knock once on the door then just enter the room as the room is so small there is nowhere you can go having the tv on the wall behind the lounge seems strange you had to sit or lay on the bed to watch it having sensor lighting in the bathroom became annoying when you are sleeping as soon as you open the bathroom door the light comes on and shine in your partners face waking them up same if you leave the door open and move during the night it also triggers the light and yes we did shut the door we both woke up with sore backs lol no not from that
