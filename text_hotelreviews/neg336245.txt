i was given a room on the ground floor at the back of the hotel the room had a view into a brick wall my experience was that of being below ground level if i spend about night on a room i expect it to at least have a view my room may as well have not had windows at all i found the front desk staff stuffy and very formal it s the sort of place where you feel like you should show up in a tuxedo
