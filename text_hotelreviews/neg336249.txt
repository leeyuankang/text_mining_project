booked and paid for the luxury one bedroom apartment upon arrival we were given the studio suite which cost less and was not what we were after travelling with a young child we wanted a separate living space unfortunately there were no more apartments available so we stayed in the suite staff were apologetic and advised of complementary afternoon tea however when checking out the bill included a charge to afternoon tea perhaps more attention to detail by the check in staff can address these mishaps
