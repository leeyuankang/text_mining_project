if you would like to ruin your london trip this is the hotel to choose they threatened us to hold our luggage in pledge for a problem which turned out to be their own accounting mistake they sold us a room with two beds and then when we got there they told us they did not have such a room two of our colleagues had to sleep in the same bed they have a very unfriendly threatening kind of approach my worst hotel experience so far
