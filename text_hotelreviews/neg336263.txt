the lady at the reception was looking strange at us we didn t feel that she is happy to have us there she was a little bit older with dark hair and she was probably manager she was looking the same way everyday we didn t feel comfortable we don t know her name because they do not have the names on uniform we think the staff mainly at the reception should be always smiling and be positive the rest of the staff was very nice
