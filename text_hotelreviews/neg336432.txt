i ve returned since the recent refurbishment i find no plugs sockets next to a bed frustrating having to use a hairdryer standing in front of a bathroom door irritating a television instead of a mirror on the wall above the only decent surface in a bedroom poor planning for the first time after many stays i felt cramped and that more than one night wouldn t be ideal
