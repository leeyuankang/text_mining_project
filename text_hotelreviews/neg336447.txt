where do i start deluxe room was not as depicted on booking com or hotel website i called twice in advance to ensure refurbishments were complete and requested a quiet room upon booking i was assured that all construction upstairs was complete yet i found myself in a room at the back of the hotel right next to a stairwell with noisy construction taking place all week as a female traveling alone i was surprised that there was no security access cards installed in the lifts and no physical deadbolts on the door when i inquired about security the male hotel staff literally laughed at me and told me this is mayfair and perfectly safe yet my friend who was not staying at the hotel easily walked through the hotel lobby at and to my room without anyone asking any questions they cheekily overcharged on room service by charging for open food rather than charging the a la carte prices shown on the in room dining menu upon check out they could not get any of their credit card machines to function so they promised to charge my card later and send me the final invoice a week after my departure and i am still waiting
