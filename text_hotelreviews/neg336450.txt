there were a few lapses by the staff another room s dirty dishes were left outside our room for more than a day we had to call twice before they were removed there was no secure location to store luggage our luggage was left unattended and i was able to remove my passport with out anyone noticing this may have been due to construction but it s still not acceptable in a hotel like this
