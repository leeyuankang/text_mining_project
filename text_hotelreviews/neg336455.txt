rate when i booked included breakfast i was sure but hey it never and at for less than hours with not even a coffee and a croissant for breakfast is a bit tight the room smelt of cigarettes which was confirmed by the lad that fixed our tv that needed a reboot finally the worst partt was a small grey haired lady at reception whom was clearly someone senior in the business giving a member of staff a public bollocking she said that he was dancing with a guest the night before i think at an event in the hotel and that he and other staff were not concentrating and as a result was short in the till float she said some people don t care here to which the lad being told off defended himself she backed off a little and then said it was not good enough with a stern tone fair enough one might say but why is a disciplinary hearing being held and heard in public it is a private business matter between employer and employee therefore not to be in the public domain regardless if he did get sacked for the allegation then he has a case for wrongful dismissal id say all that in hours at the fleming hotel and they charged me for it wow never again
