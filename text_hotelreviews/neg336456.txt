there was strong smell of paint and chemicals during our stay every morning at the sounds of construction could be heard loudly in our rooms we called ahead to ask about the renovation and we were told that we would not hear anything as they were putting final touches such as paint and no heavy construction was being done they failed to mention that the building next door was under complete construction and the sounds of jackhammers and drills could be heard easily through the walls
