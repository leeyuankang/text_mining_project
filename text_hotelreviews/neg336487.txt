i found that the hotel s service and ambience had gone down due to no doubt the ongoing building work i found the noise of the building work that started at to be somewhat irritating nothing like the noise of a drill and hammering to start the day off well and breakfast took a very long time to arrive however when i complained they did take the service charge off the breakfast cost i will go again and hopefully the building work will have finished
