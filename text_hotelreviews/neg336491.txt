we was not told there was building work going on you are not supposed to work on a sunday but we heard some drilling going on in the morning time i think we would should have been told at the time of the booking that work was taking place they did give us a letter when we checked in to say about the work on the monday and i just thought it would be miner noise but at in the morning i could just here work men talking very loud as if they were in the bathroom in my room and at it was so loud i just got up and went to sit in my daughters room on the other side of the hotel
