triple room has two normal beds and a sofa which by any means can t be call a bed for the price you pay for a room it s a shame it is not comfy at all room decor seems decades older than on the pics elevator not sufficient for the size of the venue we also didn t like the fact that after picking up our luggage after our check out we were no longer welcome in the hotel main areas i traveled with two elder women who just wanted to rest on the sofa before our evening flight as we were sited and only seated in the lobby we had a security concierge staff constantly standing next to us and checking closely what we were doing we left after and we are never coming back very unpleasant
