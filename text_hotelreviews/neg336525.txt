i usually stay at the may fair hotel whilst i am in london but decided to stay in a boutique hotel for a change not a great idea i use booking com to book as you don t pay when you book i was surprised to be charged the full amount immediately upon booking months in advance the room was nicely decorated but it smelt damp i found the source of the smell quickly as the grout in the shower area was mouldy it was disgusting the bathroom in general needed a complete update when checking in i was asked what newspaper i wanted and was amazed when i checked out to be charged for the paper the mini bar fridge wasn t cold
