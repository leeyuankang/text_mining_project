was asked if i wanted an early morning call which i did but i didn t get one good job i woke myself as i had an appointment as i was getting dressed a maid walked into my room no knock prior she just barged in i had to shout at her to get out i then heard the same thing happen on the other side of the corridor i found it frustrating that i couldn t open the windows very wide at all more as it was very hot that night i left feedback on the notepad in the room so these comments should have already been logged i also mentioned it as i left the hotel in the morning the hair dryer didn t work properly the carpet was very old worn and looked dirty i would have liked a mini bar in the room
