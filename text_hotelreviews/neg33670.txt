air conditioning in our room did not work properly we were switched to another room with ac that only functioned part of the time the staff told us that they were aware of this issue and were trying to have it fixed but based on other reviews here this problem has been ongoing for over a month the weather in paris during our stay happened to be unusually hot so it was quite uncomfortable bath towels were small and not very absorbent they seem to be old and thinned out and could use replacing
