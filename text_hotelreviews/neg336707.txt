hi i recently booked a room with the hilton green park for me and my wife for my wife s birthday mr s and mrs b lambert we stayed in room i paid for the room which i was ok with as it is the hilton hotel until i entered my room it was small undecorated the right hand blind did not shut properly so we had to put items of clothing in way to give us privacy also when entering the bathroom was disappointed at the size and also the shower in the bath not separate when i used it the shower head was cut into the ceiling stopping it from moving it up you have to lean forward to get under the water there was no shower curtain so the bathroom got flooded so it was a disappointment for me and my wife but will say that the staff where very friendly and also placed a birthday cake in our room when we returned to the hotel which i would like to say thankyou the restaurant was fabulous but the room was a big disappointment for my wife s birthday
