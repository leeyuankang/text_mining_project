the first room they put us in was shocking cracked bathroom ceiling full of mould and there was an extension lead plugging in one of the lamps for a deluxe double we were not happy we requested we moved rooms to one that was advertised on booking com which was what we should of been in originally this was better bathroom still not great cleaners don t come until around pm just as your trying to get ready to go out for your evening meal so our room didn t get cleaned when i asked for more toilet roll the cleaner didn t have a clue what i was going on about until i went and got one to show her breakfast was below average would of rather of stayed in a premier inn
