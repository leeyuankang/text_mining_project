we had a big problem with air conditioning we had two rooms and in both the air condition was not working they told us that there was a problem and they will fix very soon but they were not telling he truth every time we consulted with the reception they were telling a different story and it was obvious they were trying to buy time we asked them to change he room and this did not happen until after two days of non sleeping because of the heat and humidity i asked to speak to a manager but they said she were busy very un professional staff it was a big disappointment i wonder how did they got a high rating
