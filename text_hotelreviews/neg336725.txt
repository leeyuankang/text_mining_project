i am currently sitting in my room at this supposed star hotel after managing to scrap together a measly hour sleep my husband and i treated ourselves to a one night getaway as we were attending his works party nearby and the reviews of the hilton looked perfect they couldn t have been more wrong there is nothing about this place to suggest a star rooms are small the shower is average and worst of all i may as well have had the whole hotel to stay in my bed the amount of noise that one could hear i specifically requested a quiet room and yet they placed us on the ground floor opposite a busy road i was woken by deliveries rattling towards the hotel rubbish deliveries beeping outrageously as my morning alarm and the people upstairs crashing their thunderous feet every seconds no soundproofing whatsoever i have paid pounds for my worst one night sleep in a hotel i have ever had should have booked a travelodge
