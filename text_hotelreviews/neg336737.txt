our bathroom was horrid and scruffy bits missing off the tap window covered in black mildew cracked tiles and mildew around bth i did point this out to staff they offered to move us but having had breast surgery the week before the thought of moving was too much the mirror from the tipup dressing table was missing the curtains which were new had not been hung properly and husband did the needful there just overall needing a good spring clean from net curtains in windows to carpets all in all we were both very disappointed we returned to our room at and it had not been freshened up or beds made i did complain about that and it was rectified pretty quickly when we returned to our room at hours on tuesday night a bottle of wine and some strawberries had been left with an apology but we returned the wine as were flying home and neither could we drink it late or carry it i am not normally a complainer but i felt had visitors from abroad come to this room they would have left this island with a pretty poor view
