the rooms are awful during our night stay we changed rooms times trying to stay in one that would be better than the previous one without success the rooms are not ventilated at all windows cannot be opened and full of black fungi on ceiling and walls both in bathroom and bedroom the entire hotel needs very urgently full renovation everything is run down dirty and very poorly maintained the rooms have cracks in all walls badly cracked paint inside and outside wooden cracking floors no noise isolation at all old fashioned analogue tvs rooms are awfully decorated sofas and curtains full of stains very cheap furniture insufficient lighting in both bath and bedroom we paid euros per night for this mess a real shame
