we ve stayed this same weekend weekend of december friday thru monday for years plus it s always been a highlight to turn into half moon street and be greeted with the hotel s lovely christmas decorations along the railings and entrance this year nothing even inside looks as though the least possible has been done for the season so that clearing away on night is kept to the minimum such a pity as it s a dull street particularly as the building next door is neglected and boarded up at least as our room faced flemings hotel we benefited from the view of their outside christmas trimmings i asked three members of staff and no one knew why although i was told they had a new housekeeper someone needs to let him her know that somethings little things can really make a difference
