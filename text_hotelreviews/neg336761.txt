room looking tired old building so creaky floors unavoidable sink with large crack in it should be replaced as it is a health risk didnt complain as they wouldnt have replaced in a couple of days curtains hanging off runners which we fixed or the bright spot lights outside shine through quite a busy street so can be noisy with the traffic good if you want to get up early no attention to detail in regards to housekeeping
