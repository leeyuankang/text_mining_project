to be fair we arrived early but were told we had a room which would be ready in an hour had lunch and returned to the desk to find that our room had been given to someone else and although i had requested a room near the lift we were given one as far away as it was possible to have there were also steps to negotiate with no support the aircon broke down no explanation given in our room nor a fan on our enquiry we were told the whole of the floor aircon was broken they then offered a fan on our arrival only a trainee receptionist was on duty serving all desks and the concierge desk not good management we did get a reduction after asking for it but will not return
