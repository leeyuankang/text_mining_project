i didn t like the fact that when i wrote an email complaining about my stay i didn t even get a response out of courtesy below if what i wrote in my email i did tell them i didn t want to write a bad review to whom it may concern last wednesday august i took my boyfriend for a stay at your hotel for his birthday upon arrival we were informed that we had been upgraded from a deluxe room to a deluxe plus we thought to ourselves how lucky are we this was short lived as i was then told that there was to be a deposit taken from my card which i didn t know had to happen before i arrived in hindsight this is not a problem but i have never had money taken off a card before at any hotel before and this includes other hiltons that i have stayed in i have only ever had a copy of a card taken we then went down to our room which were most shocked to find a tiny dingy room with no natural light at all due to be two meters from another building it was also freezing when we walked in and we had to put the temperature right up from to to rectify this the bed was extremely creaky and really uncomfortable also in the bathroom the sink was blocked so any time you ran the tap it filled the sink right up and wouldn t drain for at least an hour anyway we went out for our meal and came back to our room to sleep in the middle of the night around we woke up absolutely profusely sweating because the temperature had not gone down like we had selected when we got back in we turned it back down from to when we got in at so we tried to turn it down waited as it suggested and no luck we tried to turn it off and waited but no the hot air was still blasting out this would have been okay but you don t have any access to open a window and let a breeze in other than a small crack this reminds me the view from the deluxe plus room room ground floor left a lot to be desired
