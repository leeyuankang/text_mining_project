the rooms were absolutely outrageous the downstairs area of the hotel certainly does not match the rooms our room had stains over the carpet in various patches scratches on the doors and walls where the paint work had came off and to top it off a pubic hair on the bathroom wall near the door clearly it had not been cleaned properly and this was pretty evident the cleanliness was so poor which was such a disappointment as the downstairs area of the lobby is lovely
