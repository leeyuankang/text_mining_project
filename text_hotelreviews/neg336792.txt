i never fail to be disappointed when i stay here which i do now and again because of the location the rooms are small and the staff usually seem disinterested i was given a very small room overlooking a brick wall with curtains not properly hanging down from the windows all was grim i requested another room and eventually was given a slightly bigger one i was also given a free coffee while i waited for mins for the room to be made ready but not offered this at the start i feel the rooms for the price not cheap are substandard the room i had had a mouldering wall and hairs which were not mine in the bathroom you are charged if you want the bottled water in the room no biscuits and i ve had better selections of teas in b b s the cooked buffet breakfast was not hot
