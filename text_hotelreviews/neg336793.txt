room clean but decor very worn shabby plain and colourless peeling paint and mould in bathroom holes in skirting board loose carpet with burn hole and stain food tray left in corridor all day and teapot and cups on fire exit stairs for two days afternoon tea in the hotel was disappointing definitely not worth the money there are patisseries nearby offering a much nicer menu at half the price
