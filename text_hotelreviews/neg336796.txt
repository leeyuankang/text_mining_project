what was meant to be a de luxe room was at the back of the building overlooking a small noisy rectangle for the money charged i would have expected better the room was small but clean but nothing special would not have wished to stay more than one night we booked the room there because we had received a gift of a virgin experience voucher for the evening meal the same as most of the diners that night and whilst the meal was adequate i would have expected a higher standard from such an establishment we have had far better from lowlier places
