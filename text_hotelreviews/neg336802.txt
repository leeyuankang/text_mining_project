was given a disabled room right next to reception so the bathroom was very inconvenient small sink no bench mirror low to ground so had to bend down to do makeup and was quite noisy hearing people come go at night and early in morning so didn t get a great sleep were only staying one night before flying home or would have asked to be moved
