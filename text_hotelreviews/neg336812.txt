i did not believe it when i asked for a martini and lemonade in the bar when i was told by the waiter that they did not have any lemonade eventually the waiter sent someone out to get some we were told by the waiter that they had run out and was expecting an order the next day staff who do your stock take of the bar need to be informed and to do their job better in future it was not what i expected of a hilton hotel
