rooms are unpleasant small and cramped and unusable they had to move me four times not a business class hotel creaky floors mean major noise from people walking above your room bathrooms tiny and no space to store your kit no closet space and dirty dingy chairs and carpet the staff was great but their explanation is that it is an old building that is fine but it still needs updating
