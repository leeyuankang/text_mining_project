when i did my search on the booking site i entered that i was looking for a room which included parking on arrival i found that this hotel has no parking and hi had to pay to stay at the ncp overnight which cost me and additional this is not the hotels fault this is due to booking com advertising this hotel incorrectly which has left me out of pocket
