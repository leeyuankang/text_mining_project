as we had a power cut at our original hotel green park we were moved to the park lane hilton for one night until the problem was sorted on leaving the park lane hilton we were given a bill with zero balance at the express check out however were then charged for the mini bar even though this was never used or shown on the bill when we checked out this then meant i had to call the hotel several times to try and have this amended
