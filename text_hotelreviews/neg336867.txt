we reported that the bed was rather hard uncomfortable and noisy which detracted from our stay somewhat however i had an email at home waiting for me from the manager saying they were looking into this problem thanking us for the comment and offering a free upgrade on our next visit also to contact him direct with email address just before we arrived and he would ensure all was ok for us
