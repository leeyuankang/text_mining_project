i stayed here twice in weeks first stay the room that i was given was pretty small and i was told when i checked in that they would check for a better room the next day and get back to me but i never heard back they were however very very keen to sign me up for hilton honours program second stay i was given what i think was one of the the worst rooms i ve ever stayed in ground floor at the back it was like a cave it was tiny for two people and this was described as a superior plus i asked if we could be moved which we were the next day as a consequence i was offerred a free dinner in their restaurant by the front office manager but when i mentioned this to the restaurant staff they weren t aware of it and the fom was not there so i never got it the room was slightly bigger but certainly not what i would have expected for pounds a night the windows are openable but are screwed shut so you can t get any fresh air the shower over the bath was awful no bar fridge room safe didn t work and if there are two of you with two suitcases you pretty well have to sleep with your case as there s just no space this is an old building with a lot of character in a great position but what you get in terms of rooms is certainly not good value
