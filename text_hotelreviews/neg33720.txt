there was a party across the road playing blasting music until early hours of sunday morning i had no sleep it was a nightmare the alternative room offered was freezing and had no curtains so i couldn t undress or sleep i was very distressed totally unacceptable i complained no one called the direct noise abatement police line this is an exclusive neighbourhood totally unexpected their marketing says peace and quiet far from it
