service at the bar was poor we had champagne but were not served any nuts olives and even though we were only one of two tables the waiter never came to top up our glasses which at gbp a bottle was unacceptable when we then asked for more drinks none arrived and the barman disappeared completely very poor service the room was too hot until we found a way to turn off the heating completely we had room which has a small bathroom even though my colleague s in room was a standard size this was disappointing
