staff is generally arrogant not helpful don t want even to think or discuss anything that they were not trained for also hotel has no concierge people at reception try to do their job but they do a very poor one in fact if u ask them they try to get rid of u asap they make you feel that your inquiry is waisting their time few times they made me feel not welcome
