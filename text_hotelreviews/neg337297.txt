wifi drops off frequently need to be hilton member to get free wifi that s a joke in today s age room amenities are spartan for a hilton hotel booked this well in advance and asked for connecting or adjacent rooms and best i got was on the same floor a full passage away room has no view at all looking into a driveway compared to the river view in the pictures guess you have to pay for an upgrade to one with view
