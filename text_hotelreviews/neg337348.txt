the room allocated to me was not facing the riverfront which would be fine except it was unbearably noisy in the night due to passing traffic on the road and trains on the tracks next to the road i could not sleep for nights and though i was shifted to a riverfront side room upon request i had to pay euros night extra if i had known about this problem before i would have chosen either the quieter room upfront or gone elsewhere
