irons and a phone that didn t work and an ineffective air conditioner that was set at degrees and we were still sweating all night it was cooler in the hallway outsid our room was like an oven having to pay for wifi in your room is ludicrous it is obviously another way of ripping off the customer hilton should be ashamed the location was so far out of town and no shuttle to the city or airport was provided it was also a distance to the bus or train and in the rain uncomfortable there were no restaurants or pubs close by so hilton have you trapped with their very high prices unless you want to spend lots of money getting taxis we won t be sting at the hilton again in vienna
