the staff were a bit rude what we paied for the room was way too expensive for what we got delux double room with river view our room was on the first floor and we can hear the voices of ppl laughing and talking in the morning during breakfast because the view we had was stright on top of the restaurant the gym is very small and the late night food menu was ridiculous we ordered a bean dip they had with tortilla chips and when they brought it to our room the dip was with out the tortillas and when we asked about them the lady said that they ran out of tortillas so she brought the dip alone the menu had almost or dishes total and thats a star hotel
