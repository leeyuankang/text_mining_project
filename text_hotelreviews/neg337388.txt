upon my arrival my credit card has been requested as guarantee for the room and additional expenses however the hotel blocked almost twice bigger amount than what i had to pay for my stay when i checked out i gave the same card for the payment of the room and the receptionist assured me that the extra amount which was blocked but not spent will be unblocked automatically immediately after they charge my card however two days later nothing happened and i still have the full amount blocked on my card
