the room was small and cramped and had a sloping roof which made it difficult to move around the room for two people who are tall trying to get changed it was also very very hot and we required the aircon on all the time the japanese restaurant attached to the hotel was awful and the worse japanese food i have ever tasted and to make matters worse it was massively over priced especially given the quality of the meal
