the first night we decided to have dinner at the hotel as we were rather tired after a long day but unfortunately they are not catered for it there was no chef and the food was prepared actually reheated by one of the front office staff so a big mistake and a sure no no there are plenty of restaurants a few hundred meters from the hotel so better stick to other options
