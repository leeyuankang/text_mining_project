i feel deceived by the room description of the classical double rooms on booking com which is these spacious and individually furnished rooms come with a minibar a tv and a private bathroom my room was cramped and i had to move sideways to get to the bathroom and to the desk and i challenge anyone to sit two people comfortable in the two chairs i had not booked if the description had been correct
