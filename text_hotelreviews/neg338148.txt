breakfast was a bit chaotic with not enough tables so a lot of guests standing around waiting and getting in the way of staff and other guests there is only a small bar with limited drinks available we wanted a glass of red wine and whilst there was different bottles on display we were told we could only have a glass of house red as they were not prepared to open the other bottles so why have them on the counter
