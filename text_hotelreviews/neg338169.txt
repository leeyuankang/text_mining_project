unfortunately at the very end of our stay march we were upset about the behavior of two ladies of the staff we did not have any conversations with them before that day the problem was that in the morning we asked the reception to book a taxi for us some days before that we got to know that the taxi ride from wien centre to the airport has a flat rate euro for all the taxies when the taxi arrived my husband asked the taxi driver if it was a flat rate for the ride to the airport the taxi driver said no and they began disputing about that after a while they went to the reception and my husband asked the ladies about the flat rate they were very rude with him the answer was something like we are not taxi drivers we don t know anything ect well honestly taxi drivers told us about this flat rate just days before that and also couples of our group went to the airport before us paying euro each even if the ladies of the reception did not know about the existence of this special rate or if it does not exist they just could be polite with their clients it s a pity because all the other staff of reception and other areas were extremely friendly and always willing to help it was a bit too hot in our room
