tv quite limited in choice and no pay per view gym was minuscule although there was a warning of renovation work the bad note i planned to eat in the hotel after a long work meeting at p m they told me they had no place in the restaurant since there was only waitress people total in the restaurant did not seem that busy and that they would not do room service because of that ok i understand you are in troubles but all they did for me was telling to order something online i mean you got to be kidding me is this a star or what if you have problems you should try to minimize the impact on guests rather than basically letting them on their own i don t think i will choose this hotel again
