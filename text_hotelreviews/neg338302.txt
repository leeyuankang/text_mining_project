staff behind reception were not very welcoming and arrogant at times the resturants not very accomadating for vegetarians you can t have something standard that is not on the menu ie cheese salad instead of ham or chicken ceaser salad and you also can t change anything on the menu eg with no meat or a sandwich with no onion if the menu says there is onion in the toastie silly things that i have not had the problem with in any other hotel was shocking the hotel maid just walked in our room while we were getting ready to go into centraal found that very rude but she did apologised instantly we only got given tea bags a day and small pots of milk a day glass cups which one of the days didn t get replaced along with the milk and tea bags also our shower toiletries and towels did not get replaced on that same day so we went and baught our own we told maid the next morning but other than that these are not major things and would not affect most people overall the hotel was lovely and i would recommend it to people we really enjoyed our stay here
