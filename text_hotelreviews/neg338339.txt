a little expensive overall but not that bad really the only thing that was dissapointing was the skyybar it was very poor it gave the impression of something nicer and somewhere you could go to and then sit outside looking over the city but in reality it was just a small room with badly stained seats and an odd smell the downstairs bar was much nicer
