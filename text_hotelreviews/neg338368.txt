if i had to say one negative point it would be that its a bit of a distance to walk to dam square from the hotel it would take about mins if your strolling but a enjoyable lovely walk probably a bit far if you have walking difficult taxis are very easy to get and cost about euros approx was told to always try and use tca taxis
