room is quite expensive but not very comfortable the door to the bathroom was absolutely transparent which is not nice everybody needs a bit of privacy air conditioner was not easy to adjust the air in the night was very dry and no chance to open the window breakfast was ok but nothing really special or enjoyable choice of bread was minimalistic whole wheat bread was not presented we have got only white bread plus some bread in plastic the hotel takes additional deposit about eur when you check in with my debit mastercard it was immediately booked out from account it took some days to get it back small issue but not giving pleasant feeling did not have this experience in other hotels
