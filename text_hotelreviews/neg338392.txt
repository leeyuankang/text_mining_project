one of the key cards for one of the group stopped working and therefore we had to ask for a new one i understand that the hotel needed clarification of our stay for security purposes but the attitude of the night porter was extremely rude this was on a our last night and previously the staff had been very helpful however this experience fell very far from our expectations he was eventually persuaded by the confirmation email and two forms of id however the encounter was an unpleasant experience i m not sure what would have happened if our friend hadn t been able to get in touch with me in order to provide confirmation of the room would he have been refused entry
