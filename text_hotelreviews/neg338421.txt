i stayed for days and had breakfasts included in my price i slept in the first days and on the third went for breakfast only to be told oh you have to use the breakfasts the first mornings that was not told to me when i checked in not to mention a breakfast is a breakfast shouldn t matter what day you use it you are on vacation after arguing for a little while i did finally get my breakfasts but was really annoyed i had to have the argument especially because i went to the restaurant nights in a row and bought food and drinks and tipped the extremely slow staff the bartender and waitresses were ok not really friendly and seemed to not understand that they are a waitress n bartender and asking a costumer what they would like and not letting me sit there for minutes until you acknowledge me is not cool
