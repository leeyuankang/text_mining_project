room wasn t as big as it looked on the photos breakfast was okay but was not worth euros for two that appeared on my check out invoice seriously disappointed that price was not advised when we were sat down found the whole stay at the hotel very expensive in general as the room was nearly euros for two nights and it was very secluded away from wherever you need to be
