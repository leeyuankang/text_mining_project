the staff is not professional i opted for the spoil me package that was a huge dissapointment they state daily fruit and snacks while i actually got just a banana and brownies the first day and nothing the second the package also was supposed to include the late check out by my card got blocked before and i had to revisit the reception to get it working again this was not a problem for me but really shows that they are not in sync and have no idea who paid for the pavkage and who hasn t i had received the mineral water and shampoos only the first day and had to call the reception and ask for additional ones even though the package said daily mineral water and toiletteries then at about even though i had the do not disturb sign on my door was in fact disturbed by the employee at the reception who said to me and i quote you know you have to check out i replied yes by to what she said by okay no apologies nothing not really on the level of a hotel finally i requested a company receipt on my email address in english first i got the normal invoice then i got the company one in dutch and had to double check it twice to arrive at the reception one last time and then i was told i cannot get it in english because i had already checked out my company has very strict rules regarding the receipts for the trips i take and without a propper one i would have to cover the expences by myself so this was a problem for me all in all i am very dissapointed by the service i received would not stay here again not recommended the employees that were not helpful were mr carol and trainees whose names i wont mention as they are still learning
