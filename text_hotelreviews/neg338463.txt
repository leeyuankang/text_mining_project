the woman who worked in the sky bar refused my partner entry because of the shoes he was wearing this was embaressing as we were with friends and everyone else was allowed entry it was obvious we were guests at the hotel and my partner was wearing comfy smart trainers as he has an ankle injury at the moment the woman upstairs was quite rude about this also the pool area was nice however you had to be naked in order to use the sauna which we felt was rather odd it would be nice if you could order drinks to relax with besides the pool
