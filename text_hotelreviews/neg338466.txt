bit far from heart of amsterdam but min walk will take you to the tram stop then it s only around mins to city room was quiet smaller than the rest on the floor witch was a bit annoying to see other guests with a bigger room on the same floor also it was right beside the cleaners room witch was quiet loud at times when they opened and closed the door
