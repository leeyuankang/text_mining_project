i found it quite rude how a member allowed another guest to cut in front of me in line completely disregarding me and not apologising for it i only had a small query and this was very off putting i usually stay in s for this reason the facilities are generally similar however the service is what makes the difference they also weren t very helpful with small requests i tried to explain i only needed a car parking ticket for one day of the stay on a number of occasions on check out i was charged for days the bathroom wasn t clean on arrival the towels in the bathroom were very thin
