a few basic issues hairdryer is dreadful so if you have long hair or hair that needs styling it is close to useless so bring your own also the design of the bathroom is strange it has a glass wall door so whilst i was in the shower we ordered room service but they couldn t come in as the walkway would have meant i was very exposed such a silly design and the hairdryer being in the bathroom and attached to a unit means you cant use it if someone else is in the bathroom plus the glass door is an accident waiting to happen i hope the hotel reads this finally the staff lacklustre on check out i am not sure she even noticed i was there paying let alone wish me a pleasant day or ask how our stay was i did like the hotel honestly just a few gripes particularly around design faults and receptions service
