the hotel explains it had a pool and sauna but it doesn t state that you have to pay for the sauna ten euro extra per person to use the sauna also whilst we were there the pool was being used for children s swimming lessons so the changing room and pool was full of children i could hardly move and in the end i decided not to use the pool at all as it was impossible i had a massage in the spa which to be honest wasn t very good i am a trained beauty therapist myself and the therapist didn t seem like she knew what she was doing at all
