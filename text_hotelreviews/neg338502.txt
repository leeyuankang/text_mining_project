the prearrangements we tried to make for the restaurant and skyy bar ended up a mess the breakfast food other than the croissants was awful horrible scrambled eggs everything that should be hot was cold the sliced fruit was all dried up the baked beans had a skin on them nobody appeared to be in charge of the food on offer the room was too hot and the temperature could not be controlled
