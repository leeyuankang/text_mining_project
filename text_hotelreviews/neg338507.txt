guys i like your hotel and i wish to return next year however there are things that i wish if you could kindly look into incident none at the big reception at pm and had to wait minutes for check in the feedback was not received well and i felt like i shouldn t have told him so remember other hotels have kiosk check in these days the check out was super quick and thank you incident requested for a quite room far away from elevators and not near any frequent access areas and what i was allotted initially was a room next to the elevator and also next to a frequent access door which slams on every entry and exit i had to request for an alternate room and the second room was perfect thanks for the gentleman for sorting it out but he could have read my comments from the online booking request other hotels do read it out for me at the time of check in and they make sure i get something close to it incident i felt uninvited when the lady staff at the bar told me that she is unfortunately closed at pm i thought the bar was open till pm and all orders are honoured till pm it s great if you could state that the kitchen closing time as a separate one however the gentleman at the reception was very friendly and helped me order a pizza that night thank you incident one of the cleaning staff rejected my polite request to change my bed sheet stating that its not listed for change and she showed a lot of aggression when i asked her whom should i contact to get this done we all know when someone is angry however her fellow colleague another lady was kind enough to change the bed sheets and please convey my sincerest thanks for help time and help thanks and all the best
