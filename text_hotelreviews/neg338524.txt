the only down side to this magnificent boutique hotel is the mean set of steps you might confront if you happen to walk from the train station as i did instead of hopping the tram the tram line and tram station a block away is on the same level as the lobby of the hotel if you walk from the train station as i did what a klutz you end up on a street at basement level with the hotel climbing up the stairs with luggage is a pain be smart get on the tram when you get off the train from the airport
