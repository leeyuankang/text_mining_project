the room air conditioning didn t work so the room was like an oven i mentioned this to reception and they said they were working on it but didn t seem that interested in the room there was a nespresso machine which was good but it had paper cups surely someone could nip out to ikea and buy some proper cups on the second night in the sky bar they had the great idea of putting a dj in with euro disco music pumping out at a decibels it was like being in a nightclub and reminded me why i hate nightclubs so much we left without buying a drink finally for a hotel charging euros a night they charge an extra euros to use the sauna that s just penny pinching and left me feeling a bit cheated
