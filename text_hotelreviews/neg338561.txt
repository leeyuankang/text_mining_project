there was a big mirror which was facing the bed which is kind of weird also although this is a fashion hotel it was kind of awkward to have so many plastic models in the lobby kind of frightening at night one more thing the toilet was distance from the showering and the sink which makes it pretty inconvenient the staff in the spa section was not really friendly
