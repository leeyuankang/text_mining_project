the door to the floor we stayed on was right next to our room and every time someone went through it banged very loudly i didn t like that our last night i had to spend it giving my daughter ventolin and hearing her cough all night because what i thought was a smoke free hotel was turned into a marijuana fuelled smoke up by some very inconsiderate patrons this went from smoking out the corridor to wafting into our room didn t appreciate that with a long flight home ahead of us
