breakfast was only included in the rate for night which we were not told when booking or at checking advised the following morning at dining room door but not advised price could not believe the amount when checked out extremely expensive unless eating breakfast as a main meal if on room only rate recommend eating out taxis not easily available and the company used by hotel more expensive than normal cab and took much too long to arrive you need to book them min mins before required
