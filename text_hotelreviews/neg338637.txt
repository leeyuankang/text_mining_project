went to the restaurant based on trip advisor recommendations and felt that the wait staff was rather snooty and not very friendly also beds were quite hard and the pillows even though there were two different types were not very comfortable i booked this hotel because it had a pool and others did not we were looking forward to sitting by the pool while our children swam but were told we had to wait outside and could not enter without a swimsuit we did not return i also did not realize that i would be charged a different rate for each night we stayed and the price got progressively higher per night
