the restaurant menu was limited and staff weren t as attentive as they perhaps could have been when we ordered drinks to conclude our meal we didn t get them yet they were on our bill so we had to ask for them to be removed the staff in the evening in question were all young girls and seemed too interested in chatting to each other to bother with the diners that said there was a very nice trainee barman who did an excellent job with a professional yet approachable manner who didn t seem to be getting much training input from other staff i would commend this young man
