location of hotel really poorly impacted our holiday the hotel is unexpectedly situated right on a motorway and while there are regular trams to the centre it was extremely difficult to navigate there are no english translations of tram stops making it extremely difficult to plan your journey it took us around minutes to reach the centre via tram which was a bit disappointing the hotel isn t close to any of the tourist attractions the dam square musems vondelpark red light district and so on if i was to return again i would definitely benefit from a more central hotel only good thing about the location is that it was minutes from schipol however even though this was a short ride in a taxi it was still over keep this in mind when booking a hotel
