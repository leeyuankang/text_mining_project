i was just so disappointed with this hotel i was expecting a night of a nice swim pamper in the bath room service in front of the tv and a big bed all to myself i m not sure why this hotel has such wonderful reviews for me it was rather impersonal a bit bling slightly dated style could have still been happy with this though if it wasn t for pool was closed due to low level of chlorine so i couldn t swim during my stay double bed was actually two singles pushed together so it looked like a fabulous big king bed but actually i was falling down the middle no star fishing for me crud and a long hair in bottom of bed splats of milk coffee up the wall near coffee machine scratched and worn leather on desk chair lots of chips along edge of desk essentially nothing like what i expect a hotel to be like after reading the above issues the front desk graciously wiped my bill
