breakfast very expensive so didn t go for this as there are so many cafes around the bar is very cool but there is very loud music so it s more like being in a club and not somewhere to go and unwind after a busy day of sightseeing so we did not stay for drinks in the end location is out of town so once you are out of the hotel you cannot just pop back you need to be organised to be out all day however the area is quieter and more relaxing due to this the tram is a mere min walk away so it s easy to get to the attractions
