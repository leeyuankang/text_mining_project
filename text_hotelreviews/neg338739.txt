the coffee machine in our room didn t work i notified reception times and i was assured it had been fixed and to be fair it worked once but then it died again i couldn t be bothered asking for a fourth time to have it looked at especially as we were leaving the next morning i think is overpriced for a breakfast be more reasonable
