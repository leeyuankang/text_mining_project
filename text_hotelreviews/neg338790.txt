the music from the sky bar was quite loud every night and continued into the early hours it didn t bother us too much but i imagine some people would find it disruptive the directions sent to us describing how to get to the hotel from the tram stop on our arrival weren t very good as we ended up in completely the wrong direction so something a bit less vague would have been helpful
