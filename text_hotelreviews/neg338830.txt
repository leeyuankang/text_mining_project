the sore point is the staff which is a shame since apart from this the hotel is amazing even though its far from central amsterdam some of the staff are cold and not very welcoming the blonde girls at the reception are the worst of the lot it would be unfair to generalise cleaning of rooms is not done everyday you have to specifically request for this and we were not informed of this u can imagine our surprise when we reached the hotel at night there was a technical problem with one of the rooms we were allocated reception asked us to go to sleep and they will look into the matter in the morning no seriously unprofessional we had to make a scene for them to do something when you go at reception or call at reception for some info its as if you are bothering them they reply with such an exasperated tone that you dont want to go see them again
