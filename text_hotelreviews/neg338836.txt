we booked a room for people which should have been a triple room consisting of a double and single bed however it was a double and sofa bed with not even a mattress just sheets on a sofa a proper bed had to be added to the room complimentary drinks and breakfast was provided to compensate the usb port did not work in the room and the staff were not aware of this utility this would have been very handy if was working rooms were quite dark so not great for doing your make up
