the shower pressure for me was not good enough and it took to long for me to be able to wash my hair also the outside terrace where people would go to smoke wasnt kept clean and tidy throughout the night and the outside heaters really dont do anything im guessing during warmer months the terrace is better kept however if guests are using it during winter it should be clean and tidy for all to enjoy all year round furthermore a deposit was asked of us when we arrived for the amount of euro if you then used the mini bar or ate at the hotel the cost would be deducted from your deposit and im guessing whatever remains would be returned to you we didnt give the deposit as we weren t informed previously and so our mini bar was locked so we couldn t use it another thing that they charged us upon arrival was city tax it was only euro however this wasnt mentioned before booking either i dont know how they calculate the city tax so please dont use this amount as your basis saying so ive heard other traveller s mention about paying city tax at hotels in amsterdam so i assume this is an ordinary all this though should be mentioned for people to be aware before booking
