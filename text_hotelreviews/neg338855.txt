the bed was quite uncomfortable and hard and the pillows are very big and high so i had a creek in my neck waking up in the sky at on friday the waitress who was different to the one we had wednesday and thursday was very rude and screamed in my face we cannot take you we are just too full before i had even had a chance to say hello to her i understood they were busy but as she didn t know if i just wanted a drink for my room or maybe i was meeting friends already seated i thought this was extremely rude
