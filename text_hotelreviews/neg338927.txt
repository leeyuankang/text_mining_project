we asked the hotel to book tickets for us to visit the van gogh museum to see his works at the museum but were given vouchers to attend his former residence in another part of the city it was only after we have waited in a cue for an hour and a half then to be told that we had the wrong voucher for the event we wanted to attend we were directed by map to the wrong location which we corrected but this caused us to lose to hours of our siteseeing and visiting schedule it was an unfortunate misunderstanding but my overall impression of the hotel was excellent and i shall come back and stay again
