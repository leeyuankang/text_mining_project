we ve made a reservation with one month in advance in which we ve specified that we want a twin bed and the room to be situated at the upper levels of the hotel as my girlfriend was pregnant in its month and needs a quiet room and a separate bed and they gave us a double room and put us at the floor they charged my card with a month in advance and they could ve keep a twin room when we ve complained about it the receptionist which was very unhelpful and unprofessional he was close to yell at us told us that they give us the room depending on which one are available in the day that we arrive why do we make reservations in advance and we specify certain conditions in the end they moved us in a double room at the floor also they said if we want to access the mini bar or eat dinner and put it on the room bill we have to first make a deposit in advance we couldn t charge anything to our room unless we made an advance deposit never happened in any hotel all over the world this experience and we payed euro a night for three nights for this was totally unacceptable and ruined the whole holiday
