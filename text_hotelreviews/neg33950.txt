the room we were given on the top floor was really smelly we reported this and were give two glasses of complimentary champagne whilst the technician checked it it apparently was the aircon which he switched off and we were given a heater this was ok in the bedroom but the bathroom was very cold it would have been better if we were given a different room however this did not spoil our stay food in restaurant excellent and staff very helpful
