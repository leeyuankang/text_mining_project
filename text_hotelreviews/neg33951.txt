this property does not reflect hilton image at all i stayed in and found the room to be pretty stange interms of convenience access and in general service was bad and the whole experience wasn t pleasant my colleague who stayed in was earlier directed to a room where there was someone already staying and that too in the middle of the night a serious lapse on part of the hotel reservation team i would say there is a lot to improve upon
