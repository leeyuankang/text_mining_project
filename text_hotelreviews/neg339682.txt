avoid room if you are over feet tall i am foot inches tall and had only inches of space between my head and the rafter beams in the middle of the room none around the sides the surface area of the room was reasonable but not the height this was not good value euros for one night in an attic room i suspect that this problem may well be common to all rooms on floor at the back of the hotel
