i did not like the fact that i was given a room on the ground floor facing the street while i had requested a quiet room when i booked over a month ago as i have problems of insomnia also i did not like the way the staff handled my complaint as they said that that was the only room available and they couldn t move me to another one as they were fully booked so if i was not happy i could leave not one apology very rude staff i also had a prepaid rate so could not leave unless loosing the money i had already paid the room was noisy as beside the cars on the street i could hear every single guest going in and out of the hotel and also their conversations the room was also very dark as i had to keep the curtains closed as my window was facing the street and so was open to everybody to look inside breakfast was very poor and the wifi didn t work and when i asked the concierge to help me to log in they were unable to make it work so couldn t work on my laptop unless using my mobile connection phone reception was also very bad so i had to open the window the one on the street in order to make a phone call as i often travel to paris for business i just wanted to try a new hotel but this one was definitely a huge disappointment i hated my stay at opera marigny i will never go back thank you
