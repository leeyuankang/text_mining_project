toilet doesnt have a toilet brush i know its awkward to mention this but trust me its a nuisance design over function is great until you have to clean the toilet they give you a breakfast bag that you hang on your door its a joke of a breakfast a banana a granola and a pseudo fresh orange juice realistically people that are paying the kind of rate hoxton is charging dont need a banana and a granola in the morning its a hipster touch that i didnt appreciate to be honest maybe if it had a croissant inside if you are willing to pay euros you can always have brunch at the hotel restaurant which was fantastic eggs benedict on point
