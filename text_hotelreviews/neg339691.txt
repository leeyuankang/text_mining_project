the mattress in room was way too soft i woke up with back ache on first day and spoke with staff who said the bed didn t have proper support and they had fixed it it helped a little but i did not sleep well on any of the nights the room was very cold it has big open windows and i could feel the draft on my back every night and i actually got flu staying at the hotel it was very cold in amsterdam but i definitely could feel the rooms were chilly my biggest complaint is the fact that your paying a night and the tv kept losing signal it has over channels and most of them are dutch speaking but you would think there would be options to rent a movie considering most of the people staying at hotel are english speaking etc perhaps this was just the wrong hotel for me but i would not stay here again also on my last day checking out i was told that someone had billed my room for over for food which i didn t eat which is a bit crazy i don t know what system they operate but you would think they would be able to manage people s bills etc in an orderly fashion
