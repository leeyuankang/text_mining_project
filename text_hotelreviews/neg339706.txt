the room was much smaller than the photos on the booing com and croxton websites but it seemed to be that we had actually been given the smallest room on the floor we could see this from the fire escape plan map in the hallway it would have been nice to have been allocated a larger room considering we had just gotten off a hour flight it was difficult to open and store our luggage in such a cramped space
