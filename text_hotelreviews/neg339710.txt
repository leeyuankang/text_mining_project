our room was a little cold but it was ok with the heater air con unit set to maximum we were only staying for two nights so it wasn t a problem but i was surprised that there wasn t a wardrobe or much storage space even though we had a large room a robe would have been nice too especially at this price point we had a brunch in the restaurant which was pretty disappointing the menu and presentation looked great but the food was very forgettable
