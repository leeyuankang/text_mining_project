some of the staff were super friendly and super helpful especially the bar staff who found me a cocktail that suited me perfectly the restaurant staff though we re a little all over the shop we didn t really get what we asked for and it was a massive effort to say that we have a tab to pay before we went home too as we wanted to pay them together in the end they had lost our tab but still managed to say to reception that we had a tab so we had to chase it up ourselves and retell them everything we d bought in order to settle the bill not a massive downer on our perfect trip but just a bit annoying
