unfortunately when we arrived our room was not ready as we arrived early morning but they notified us that the room would be available at we went out and came back at the room was not ready they still had to take measurements of the room and said it would take another minutes minutes later we were allowed to enter the room there was quite a lot of noise within the hotel because the walls are so thin you can hear your neighbour s conversation no new sheets were given everyday they would just re make the bed even though the sheets were dirty we also put up a do not disturb sign once but they still entered the room the staff were polite but not very enthusiastic and engaging overall i wouldn t return back to this hotel
