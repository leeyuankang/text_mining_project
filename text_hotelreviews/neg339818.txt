the first thing the lovely young receptionist told me about this hotel when checked in was hey the hotel would charge you for your entire reservation no matter you stay or not no matter how long you stay no matter you want to change your travel plan or not well this is way too impressive please also note not to carry big luggage no one would help you at the door according to my own experience and observation of many others in total this is a good hotel and deserves all guests recommendation
