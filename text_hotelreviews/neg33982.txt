when we came into our room all we could see was a sofa bed and a child bed next to the sofa on different levels as it was all dark we didn t know the actual bed was in another room once we have figured out that there was another room with a nice bed it was ok however if the staff would have removed the child s bed and had left a nice sofa it would have been much nicer and no missunderstanding
