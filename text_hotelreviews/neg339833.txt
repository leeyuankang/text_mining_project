they did get our room booking wrong on arrival and could not find our second room they switched our rooms to allow for twin beds for one of our party who was pregnant but then gave another guest the same room and the guest walked into our room unannounced thinking it was their room apparently something wrong with the system we ordered two beers on room service and they never arrived hours later we went down and cancelled them and they still appeared on the bill the following day so we had to explain again that we never received them having said all of this they did correct where they went wrong and were very amenable
