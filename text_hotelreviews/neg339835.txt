nothing i didn t like i would only say that the lobby was very active busy with a party atmopshere which i hadn t expected so it was tough not possible to get a seat there in the evenings would say hotel should hold tables like the mandarin oriental does for hotel guests also re the breakfast bags would say there should be a no cost alternative to the yoghurt for folks like me who are lactose intolerant i tried to get alternatives but was charged in the end for the croissant and muffin but again these are small nits the hotel overall was amazing and big kudos to the staff you are the best
