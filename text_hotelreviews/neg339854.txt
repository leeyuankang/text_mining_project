although the breakfast bags are a nice touch make sure to include a spoon for the cereal or make it obvious where one can find utensils in the room i was in a rush couldn t find a spoon so had to skip the good looking cereal just a minor issue for sure the somewhat steep room prices are a more significant issue but common on this location
