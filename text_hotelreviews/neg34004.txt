i was disappointed with many things starting with the lobby tiny reception no lobby to the breakfast area which seats up to people only and seats are cramped with no room to circulate comfortably to the elevator there is small elevator only which does not fit three people with their suitcases when you get out of the elevator on the room floor level it is very dark and the lights do not switch on right away you actually have to walk in the dark for a good few steps which is a risk hazard especially that there is a steep spiral stairs to your right and someone can easily trip over it in the dark not enough light in the room either very small closet i was staying in the superior double room so i was expecting better room was not cleaned properly dirty tea cups were not changed friendly staff though
