when we checked in the hotel staff invited us to breakfast my presumption totally my fault is that the breakfast was included with the hotel bill not we were charged euro per person for the breakfast that in my opinion is pricey for some yogurt fruit and a cup of coffee there are many wonderful cafes close to the hotel the value in those would have been far better
