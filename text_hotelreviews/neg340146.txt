i suppose it would be nice to have a library with books one can read in addition to the wonderful and huge library of signed books by authors who have stayed here the are under glass and although of course one can ask to see them they re not really for reading and spilling drinks on let alone taking up to one s room but maybe everyone has kindles nowadays and people don t have any paperbacks to leave to contribute to a hotel library
