we were in a superior canal facing duplex room with our own entrance almost like having your own flat only niggle was that bed area up stairs gets quite hot and is difficult to cool down this is made worse by steam from the bathroom they should install a fan in the bathroom not a big issue but takes away from a perfect score in all other respects this is a great hotel
