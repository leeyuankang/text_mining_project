the food menu in the room gave two options a room service menu and b non room service menu i fancied something from the non room service menu so went to reception to ask for directions to the dining room i was guided to the restaurant and seated but the menu was different again i explained what i d wanted and the waitress said she d ask the chef if on this occasion he d allow me to have my food selection in the restaurant he did but this made me feel inadequate cheap food was nice if not a little embarrassing to obtain this isn t the right place for you if all you want is good pub grub its more for the fine dining experience
