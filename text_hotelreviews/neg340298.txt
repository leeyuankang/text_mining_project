the room was awkwardly small very limited storage no place to even set up luggage rack bedside tables tiny and one partly blocked the entrance door if one person was moving around the room the other person had to to step aside and wait first room assigned was a basement room that flooded within the first two hours moved to small room and given a bottle of wine as compensation wifi free but slow and sporadic room was expensive given what we got while i know that there are very lovely rooms in this hotel in the future i would not gamble and hope to secure one given my experience
