we were incorrectly told the serving time for breakfast by the night porter resulting in us missing breakfast on our first morning when coming down to breakfast and pleading our case to the serving staff we were helpfully told i don t think so you wouldn t be told the wrong time reception aware and no apology or approach to us made wine available before strange as spirits available a real disappointment especially when other special guests were served wine on request
