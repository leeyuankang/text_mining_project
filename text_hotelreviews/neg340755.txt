i don t want to criticise this place because it felt like a family run hotel with fabulous staff who ensured we had a perfect stay but for the purposes of trip advisor honesty the rooms were cramped and felt dated although furniture was new so perhaps that is the dutch styling beds are incredibly comfortable hallways are a bit grubby if you can get rooms for a good price the staff and lounge well and truly make up for any negatives i would stay here again
