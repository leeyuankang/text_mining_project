the breakfast was fine if you wanted the cold items bread meat cheeses etc however if you wanted a cooked breakfast this was appalling the bacon on both mornings was well passed crisp and was cremated although the eggs were cooked on request they were tasteless quite simply this was the worst breakfast i have ever had in a hotel mini bar in room poorly stocked and no tea making facilities in the room
