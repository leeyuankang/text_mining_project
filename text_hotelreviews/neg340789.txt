first time that i had to pay a late check out fee i understand it s the hotel policy just caught us off gaurd after spending so much money at this hotel hotel also needs a doorman and a way for strollers or anything on wheels to get up and down for the few couple of steps in front of the building overall art deco look of the building is nice but maybe they should touch up the scuffs on the walls
