would have been better if the breakfast had been included in the price we had a look on our first morning to see if we wanted to buy it before we went elsewhere however we decided against it as the croissants etc hadn t been covered up and there were flies everywhere which put us off buying it admittedly it was very hot that day however covering food up for me is basic food hygiene
