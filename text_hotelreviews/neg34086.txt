it would have been nice to have had a bit more variety on the bar snack menu or room service or a mini bar scenario as it was u were not allowed to take food or drink from out side to ur room but there wasn t anything to purchase from the hotel either so unless u ate drunk externally you were very limited to what was on offer in the bar area downstairs after when breakfast finished there were a few drinks on offer only
