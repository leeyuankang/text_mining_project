it s not a secret that paris service standards can leave foreigners cold and the reception i had at this hotel was a perfectly brutal example example night desk man was rude at entry extremely perturbed to have been bothered to step away from his internet to answer the door chastised me for trying the back door first terrible check in obnoxious cold condescending and then when i asked him to please cool it he wasted no time launching into the insults condescension and defending his actions as legitimate as if his paying customers cared le coup de grace you foreigners think your money buys you everything well actually sir this foreigner s money will simply buy me reservations every few weeks at the polite hotels in paris where they appreciate the customers and don t put them down hotel diva indeed
