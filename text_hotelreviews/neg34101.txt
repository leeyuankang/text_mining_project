firstly it was very warm degrees on march and the airco was still on wintertime apparently the airco is centralized and can t be managed per room so it was very hot in the room but the manager guillaume meant well and organised a fan in our room which gave some relieve secondly we went out one day by pm so the room still needed to be cleaned when we came back at night the room was not cleaned at all when we complained and the receptionist came up to our room he was very unprofessional looking annoyed gazing at us as we have never travelled before not knowing what to say and to do no apology and not service minded at all he could only get us clean towers and even wanted me to go down to get them when i checked out the next morning the receptionist was aware of the complaint tried to help explaining that after pm there is no one for housecleaning anymore but could not do anything the manager guillaume was called but he could not offer us anything in return considering this is a star hotel which you pay the service for i expect the room to be cleaned even after pm if they do not offer this service it should be mentioned at the website and at the reception furthermore the receptionist from the night shift should be proper trained to give proper service also what is the point of having airco mentioned if this can t be organised per room if you would like to have guests return to your property you should be able to give a discount after this discomfort but even that could not be done so if you are looking at the rating for this hotel it is not up to the star standards it is also noisy being next to the staircase and staying at the first floor the breakfast is poor boiling eggs not a success you better go across the street to the patisserie cheaper and more tasteful also one morning the wifi did not function and since i am travelling for work this also did not help not coming back to this hotel again it is overrated
