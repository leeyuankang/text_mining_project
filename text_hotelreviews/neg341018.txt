nothing we didn t like about this hotel we didn t eat breakfast there as thought it was a little steep and we wanted to go into amsterdam for breakfast we also extended our booking by two nights well in advance of our arrival it ended up being two separate bookings and our keys newspaper request stopped after the first booking it wasn t a problem only a thought worth mentioning
