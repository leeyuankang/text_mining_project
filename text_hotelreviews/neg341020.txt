upon registration we explicitly mentioned that we are in a hurry and want to finish with all procedures as quickly as possible nothing of the kind the staff started showing us hot towels and ancient flavours from which we were asked to select for our room all this finished after minutes so we missed our appointment for the staff it was more important to give its performance than meeting our will later while waiting in the lobby for the room being cleaned my partner tried to ordered a tee but they didn t offered any herbal infusions so we gave up ordering there were cookies on the table in the lobby so my partner took two or three of them in a small plate and sat in the chare in the lobby to our surprise the lady responsible for the lounge came to us and rudely told us that cookies are not free of charge and they only could be taken if we ordered something all this happened after we left a solid deposit on the front desk all this made us a bad impression but we wouldn t even mention it here if the following didn t happen on the next day we asked the concierge of the hotel to help us finding a lawyer who could give us a consultation about a contract which was part of our visit to the town the concierge contacted a lawyer which was familiar to the hotel and arranged the consultation and only told us that we need to have money in cash because the lawyer do not take payments be card so far so good after the consultation of about an hour we were given an invoice for euro deposit the lawyer assured us that he informed the concierge about the deposit and we must have been informed about it when we later asked the concierge he denied knowing anything about rates of the lawyer obviously someone was lying and we asked the manager to investigate the case after more than a month we only received a note from the hotel that their service was ok and nothing wrong happened
