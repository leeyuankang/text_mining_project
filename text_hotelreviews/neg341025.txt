we were disappointed with the service at breakfast we felt rushed and were constantly reminded of their need to clear us out so they could set up for lunch also when checking out we ordered a taxi to the airport we were told that someone would come to our room to collect the bags no one came and when we arrived to reception there was no taxi waiting the staff whilst lovely people struck us as being quite dishevelled and not working as a team
