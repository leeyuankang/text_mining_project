entrance as a wheelchair user through the back of house is very unwelcoming and not worthy of a star hotel i felt like a criminal being guided through the kitchens and the smelly corridors the in room breakfast was a complete disaster both quality and service wise cold eggs cold coffee incomplete order waiter not even setting up the table having to come back times to complete order very disappointing reception apologised and removed the charge it does not however make up for the ruined experience so much for a romantic morning in bed i cannot but feel that as a disabled person i get the shortest straw in terms of room type the care that goes into making the room accessible goes at the cost of luxury
