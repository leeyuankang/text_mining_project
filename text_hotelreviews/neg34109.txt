one evening at about and after a long day of walking we were laid on the bed reading there was a knock at the door and before i had chance to get to the door the manager was entering the room using his master key when i asked him what he wanted he replied just checking no further explanation was given i went down to complain later but he had left we checked out the day after so i didn t get a chance to challenge him
