firstly we specifically mentioned in our reservation that we would be arriving early between am as we were taking an overnight train from prague to vienna when we arrived they told us rather rudely that they had no place for us until in the afternoon i showed them the email correspondence i d had prior to arriving and still the dismissed me by time i came back i had been awake more than hours without sleep despite being promised a room considering our circumstances before coming the room was clean but the pillows had zero stuffing in them and the beds are hard the air conditioning may as well not be there as it s so weak and the wifi didn t reach our room on the third floor overall i wouldn t recommend senator hotel vienna you can absolutely find better accommodation even closer to the city centre than this miserable place
