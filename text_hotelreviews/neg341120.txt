air conditioning didn t work we tried two different rooms at full blast the room was f c and very humid we chose this hotel only because they promised air conditioning so we were very disappointed open wifi worked fine but could be a problem easier for hackers hotel has lots of tour bus guests not a problem for us but lobby and elevators are congested in early morning and afternoon nice stairs though
