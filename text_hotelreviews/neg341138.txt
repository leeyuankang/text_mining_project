location is far from the centre and from the airport beds were small there was no tea coffee facilities in the room and breakfast was not included i have booked for nights and i found this accommodation was not good for us and when i asked the reception to stay only nights they refused and then i asked if possible move us to another room with a double bed next day or after they said all the rooms are full if you close the window room becomes hot and if you open widow then you get noise from street and trams shower hose was lose so you have to hold by hand we told reception to fix it but nothing been done
