i am very dissapointed about the staff and their behavior when i pointed that they made big mistakes when they charge me the whole amount for the entire stay on the day before and then took again the first night on the day of our arrival we paid in cash but still had a lot of trouble to get our money back and we were not the only customers treated in this way maybe because we are romanians we came in your country to spend money that we earn in our country we didn t come like others to ask you something for free i ve been in austria so many times and i had the best experiences i hope this was just a singular case
