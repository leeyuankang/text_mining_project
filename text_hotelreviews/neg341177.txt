the hotel was a tram metro journey to the city centre so not the best location also the hotel were pretty understanding about my mistake in booking the incorrect date and did change it but at a very costly price our two night stay was very expensive before they added on this price so i was very disappointed i d like to add that the hotel in prague changed the date without any further cost
