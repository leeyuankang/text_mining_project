i wondered how people said that good reviews on this hotel and seems it got an award from booking the breakfast was pretty bad not much varieties the room was small the bathroom was very basic this is for sure a stars hotel i was in vienna before many times this hotel is absolutely not a stars hotel so pay your money for a hotel and save the money for better things
