the attitude of the new staff is somehow different comparing to the period when we were times guests at the senator hotel this doesn t mean stuff is rude impolite or anything similar they are mostly ok but it s not the same like it was we asked with a smile before we came as well as when we arrived is it possible that for our stay we get one night of free parking but the reply was very short we don t have free parking it costs no problem we parked our car on the street outside the time limited parking zone minutes by foot from the hotel there are no slippers in the room like it was earlier also no small bottles of shampoo for hair and shower gel and body lotion there were small bottles earlier now there is one regular sized body hair shampoo gel wi fi in our room was mostly slow weak especially in the evening these are small details not very much important but it effects our complete average score so we give instead of we gave in the previous years anyway shows we consider this hotel as very good
