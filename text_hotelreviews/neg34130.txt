i thought the price was a little too expensive for what you re getting but what upset me the most was that was taken from my account as a deposit which is fine but when i checked out the full room charge for two nights was also charged which i did not budget for this made my trip more expensive and getting to the airport difficult and unpleasant as there was no money left on my card i am still waiting for this deposit to be reimbursed
