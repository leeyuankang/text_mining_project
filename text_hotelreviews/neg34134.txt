location could have been better but not too far from the metro i contacted the hotel prior to our arrival as i was trying to arrange a bottle of champagne to be delivered the morning of her th birthday but they never even acknowledged the emails in the end i decided not to pursue as it was not worth the effort they knew it was her birthday as they wished her happy birthday on check in so had obv received emails with request just a little niggle that annoyed me it overall hotel fine
