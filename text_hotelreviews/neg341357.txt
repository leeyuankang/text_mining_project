the hostess on the evening shift was not nice unfortunately one blanket cover was dirty and the hostess said that maybe we are responsible we explained that the dirt was dry and old only then she replaced the blanket cover and said she is sorry old room decor and disappointing compared to the pictures on the site the bathroom is very small and not modern on the table in the room was a small bottle of water with euros written on it too bad they did not attach a note with a more pleasant explanation
