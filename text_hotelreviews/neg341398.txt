costly for small room i did not like that when we arrived and during check in i paid for the breakfast for the two nights in the morning i was sick and did not go for the breakfast my husband went alone but he informed the staff that i am sick and can t eat breakfast and requested for yoghurt and tea to the room when we were checking out i found that they have charged the breakfast for two persons and also the room service we explained to them and tried to request them to consider either one even if they charge the breakfast which was expensive but they said breakfast is nonrefundable and they claimed that they only charged the delivery for the room service again don t know why it is not a big deal for this small case but they could manage it better so we an appraise and give good comment about the hotel
