i mistakenly booked the room rate without breakfast and was happy to receive an email prior to our arrival giving me the option to add breakfast for person room not cheap but we wanted to enjoy their breakfast buffet so i booked the upgrade when we checked in i found out that one can add breakfast for room nigh for a family of that s a difference per might this was an unpleasant and frustrating experience since the booking through booking com could not be undone the email one receives offering upgrades makes it look as if it came from steigenberger directly when in fact it comes from booking com that s almost deceiving lesson learned on this trip booking com rates are almost always worse than booking directly with the hotel another issue we encountered not only but also at the steigenberger although rooms with twin beds were specifically offered and one reason why we decided to book a certain hotel over another that wouldn t offer seperate twin beds we never got the separate beds we requested but ended up with one king or queen i have a feeling that this would also be handled better if done directly with the hotel last but not least our room was on the small side and almost a bit claustrophobic our kids had a slightly larger room which seemed more airy and comfortable
