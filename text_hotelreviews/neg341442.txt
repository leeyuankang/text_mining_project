this is not a star hotel anymore we already stayed there a couple of times but this stay did not meet our expectations breakfast is mediocre but allright we wanted a nice and relaxing sunday brunch until which is a bonus but at they in particular a busy manager started taking away tables and seats in one of the two rooms for a lunch buffet until it was empty they only waited that we would finally leave after having been there for minutes after having changed the room we noted that also the nice tea bar was gone and had been replaced by a champagne bar for the lunch the small spa is not very clean wet towels left by guests everywhere dirty glasses empty soap dispensers no tea water mould in the steam room broken fittings after two days we did not use the spa anymore the first days the bar was used for a convention and rearranged with additional functional furniture it came along with a heavy smell of food on one evening it was even closed for some time on the last day the room service came late but the breakfast was abbondant too many inconveniences and negative points for stars and the room price of more than euro without breakfast which is it is a pity but we have to look elsewhere
