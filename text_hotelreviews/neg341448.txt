i was really disappointed with the service especially for the price to be honest i have no idea how it was a star hotel felt like a or lower as far as service goes we asked in our booking request for a feather free room due to allergies this did not happen okay fine we then asked additional times for the bedding to be swapped out in a night stay it didn t happen until after on our last night we also ran out of tissues on the morning of day they were not replaced during any of the the room cleanings so we had to ask for them to be replaced they still never were they never asked us how our stay was or was going all of this would be fine for a star or star or below but unacceptable for a star of this pricing honestly don t waste your money you won t get the experience you re looking for
