i had booked more than a month in advance and paid upfront for superior rooms via booking com when we arrived at pm i was told the rooms were not ready and they would call me when ready with the guaranteed room check in at pm so we went out and had lunch but since i was not feeling great and it was raining i came back and sat at the lobby we finally got the rooms at pm not a minute earlier which was disappointing as many other guests were getting their rooms earlier at check in i was told that my booking category was lower than theirs overall this was disappointing as i requested even one out of our two rooms if ready but was not given any flexibility i travel at least twice a month internationally and this was a very unusual experience which left a bad taste in my mouth frankly it was clear that they waited till the pm deadline which could have been managed better
