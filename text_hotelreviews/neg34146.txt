firstly i had a birthday which we wrote in private message while booking but the management didn t react ok maybe they didn t see it but our executive room was just not value for money there was bad smell during all our stay even though i saw aroma candles which obviously didn t help there wasn t any slippers or bathrobe executive room in best western come on are u joking what happened with bw and the night staff wasn t friendly when i asked for extra blankets because it was too cold the guy gave me few with such face like i was asking him to steal them for me the bar was closed at night so we couldn t drink champagne to celebrate definitely not best western quality i stayed with them in many cities worldwide and big dissapointment for my birtday night i wish i chose another hotel
