superior queen sized room was small the width was only a little longer than the bed only one arm chair although it s a double room but probably wasn t room for a second one room faced the inner courtyard which we thought would mean it was quiet but there was a private party in the bar one night that was very loud indeed and disturbed us even though we were on the fifth floor and although the party was meant to be in the bar it spilled out into the lobby so we had to push through to enter the hotel and get to the lift
