the room smelled damp or like it had been smoked in the bed wasn t comfortable and even though i put the do not disturb sign on the door they came in anyway they never restocked the mini bar the hotel staff wasn t very friendly even though it is not inexpensive to stay there they didn t even ask how my stay was when i departed
