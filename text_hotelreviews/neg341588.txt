we ve stayed at many steigenberger hotels around the world konstanz eden z rich etc unfortunately the experience with the reception restaurant staff is always the same rather negative they are very slow incompetent especially the reception many of them are trainees and students and that s also the image they portray not a star hotel in any way don t get fooled by the initial appearance i wouldn t book it again parking is very expensive mini bar not filled up daily
