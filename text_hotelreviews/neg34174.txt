the air cons is this hotel do not work we were first allocated a very small room with a broken air con when we complained we were moved to a nice big room with a broken air con we choose the bigger room and took the fan from the small room with us some bedrooms have extremely small bathrooms the hairdryer did not heat up only one setting so it is nearly impossible to dry thick long hair with it
