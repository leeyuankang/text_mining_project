there were things that i did not expect to find in a radisson chain hotel during check in i was surprised to find out that hotel not only needs my credit card information but also wants a security deposit of eur room was already paid normally i understand why this is happening but here why exactly this sum though minibar contents surely are not worth eur after checkout they didn t release the blocked amount what if guest needs this money in the end of long journey this is totally unacceptable floor heating in the bathroom did not work properly as i was trying to switch it on all the electricity in the room was out we could not even close the door because there was an electronic lock it seemed to be a common problem as staff was pretty fast with resolving it still why to implement floor heating if guests cannot use it
