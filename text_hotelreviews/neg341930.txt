error by booking com which cost us a further euros and we would like this refunded please when we went to check in hotel advised us that it is not their modus operandi to reserve two adjacent rooms so why did booking com not advise us of this if you had we would not have booked this hotel our reason my wife s sister is extremely nervous when in strange surroundings and had to be in an adjacent room to make this work we had to upgrade to a small suite and my wife s sister was able to have an adjoining room we await your refund please
