booked a twin room requested beds given a double for men moved to another room and given a temporary bed which was too short and narrow to sleep comfortably on breakfast service was terrible minutes to take an order and a further waiting for for a plate of scrambled egg charged for extras we didn t not have minibar etc too much hassle to ever use again
