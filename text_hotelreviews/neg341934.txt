we had a misunderstanding with the booking and booked the same junior suite under the same name twice and the hotel apparently didn t notice this or noticed it and thought we needed two junior suits there were two version depending who you spoke to and because of their strict cancellation policy they still charged us one night because we cancelled the one unencessary suite although half price because we argued for hour in the lobby and we were with a year old fussy toddler on top of it all they had free rooms in the hotel and free junior suits but they still charged us euros to teach us a lesson maybe i really hope they used the money well so that goes for flexibility none and one morning i walked in the room while the maid was cleaning it and she had put the pyjamas on the floor while making the bed that was disgusting not too much choice at breakfast and only or waiters when half of the food was a la carte and you had to wait for order so don t expect a quick breakfast here
