one of their staff was totally unfriendly and did not help us much also one time we wanted to enter the elevator and there was enough space for me and my wife to enter the elevator but he just looked at us trying to catch up to the elevator and did not even bother trying to open the door before it closes cold looks in his eyes we did not like how he looked at us or the way he was talking to us we stayed in a suite and the shower did not have a rubber at the edge of the door from the bottom to prevent the water from leaving the shower area and making us feel like the bathroom was hit by a rain storm
