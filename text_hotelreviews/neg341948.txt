we booked a room on booking com described as double twin share we specified twin share in the comments box when we arrived we were advised that the room was a double and we would need to pay an extra for a twin share room as this bought the total room cost to it made the hotel less competitively priced compared with others in the area we felt that the advertising for the room was deceptive and misleading and we should have been told at the time of booking that a twin share was not available next time we make a booking on booking com we will definitely be ringing the hotel to clarify the room type the reception area and availability of staff to assist with checking in and luggage was inadequate the minibar had limited variety the room was overheated and we had the windows open most of the time overall we were disappointed with the hotel it s more of a star not a star
