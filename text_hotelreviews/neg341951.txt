the room information book was far from accurate eg we were told that we would get dressing gowns and slippers these were never provided and when we left the reception woman told me that these were in some special suites on the first evening we asked for two more pillows and the hotel did not have any each day we asked for breakfast in our room on no day did the breakfast provided actually consist of the listed items somedays there was one of something sometimes no plates etc
