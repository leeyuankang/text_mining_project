arrived very late tired hungry and in pain from combination of arthritis and long haul flying needed food to be able to take meds no food available in hotes except junk in minibar or send out for pizza tried to walk to only thing available nearby mcdonalds i was desperate but couldn t find it and gave up because of pain at these prices a couple of pieces of fruit for new arrivals especially arriving so late would be good i won t stay here again sometimes access to food is not a luxury but a necessity
