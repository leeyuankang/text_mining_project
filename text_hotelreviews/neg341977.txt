i travelled with a colleague hotel had booked us a double instead of twin had to sleep on camp bed no recompense or apologies the coffee machine has no instructions there is no tea and you have to ring down for milk or kettle so useless and for a hotel of this cost i expect to be able to make a drink in room the breakfast cost is extortionate
