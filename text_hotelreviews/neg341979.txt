the lady working on the reception is not friendly and she gave me very bad first impression but on the other side the other two guys were very helpful and professional wifi was so weak and the television channels were only the austrian german ones for example bbc cnn or al jazeera are not available while taking shower the water will leak a lot from under the door and it s really dangerous because you could slip easy when you will step on the floor
