the carpet was wet in spots when we entered the room as if it had been stain treated the headboard had a tear in it the furniture seemed a bit worn out in the room the shower leaked all over the bathroom floor there was construction outside the hotel this information should be made available when making reservations the street work was being done throughout the night and it was very noisy it was also very difficult to get to the nearest parking garage i understand that there is nothing the hotel can do about the construction i just wish there was a way to know this when booking the room
