dining facility was extremely poor due to understaff kept waiting so long for our meal we left the hotel and found an excellent restaurant nearby if the radisson blu is offering dinging facilities then it should be staffed accordingly waiters and kitchen staff chefs the delay with our first course was over thirty minutes and no feedback from the staff as to the reason behind the delay it must be assumed that there wasn t any cooking staff on site
