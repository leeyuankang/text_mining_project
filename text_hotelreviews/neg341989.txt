had to ask a receptionist to look for bartender because we were sitting in a bar for minutes with zero staff in sight not much of a view outside of the window just a wall of the next building across the narrow street they offer eggs benedict for breakfast that were a complete joke the egg itself was cooked hard and the whole thing was soaking in a lot of source which wasn t smooth as it s supposed to but rather had small crumbles in it in contrast their omelet and soft boiled eggs made on order are quite ok
