definitely not a stars hotel service was poor we had to ask for the bathrobes and slippers on the second day when we realized although they were part of the accessories of the room they were not provided the used glasses were not replaced for two days i always thought that there is a night round of service in a hotel in this hotel it was only on the first night and then we had to take the covers and pillows when the ventilation or central heating we never quite understood what exactly it was started at the sound was so strong that it was as if we were sleeping in the engine room the closet was very small and fit for a single room and it was a complete disorder the papers for breakfast laundry papers and sacs mixed and messy and half the hairdryer was missing obviously nobody took a look after the previous clients had left one shampoo and one shower gel for two persons and the towels were old small and cheap quality
