i had a very bad experience with a taxi driver taxi was booked via the hotel reception he picked me up from the hotel and even though i did mention to the reception i was going somewhere close apparently he was not informed anyway the driver started shouting at me because the ride was short and from this hotel they do not call him for airport transfers but only short drives he dropped me off at the wrong place anyway since he was very angry i did not unfortunately take his name and number otherwise i would have gone to the police to report this incident i did mentiont his however to your receptionist a gentleman who was there when i got back it was a lady at the reception who booked this taxi for me perhaps it would be good if you check your associates because it is a shame that someone stays at your hotel and is so happy about it that it takes one stupit idiot supplier to spoil a stay thanks
