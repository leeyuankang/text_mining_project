i chose this hotel after i read many reviews particularly noting about the air conditioners because it is somehow a problem in europe to find a good hotel with a good air conditioning system especially in summer but i didn t expects that i will face this problem in autumn the air conditioner in room was not working properly which caused us interrupted sleep at nights as the room was warm we reported that to the receptionist and he promised to send someone from the maintenance the next day when we had the same problem we talked to recptionist again but this time he said that he cannot do anything about it and all what we can do is to open the windows
