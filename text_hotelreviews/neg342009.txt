we thought it is a star hotel as was mentioned but seems like star starting from entire hotel look from outside dusty ground floor and ending with aged furniture laud coffee machine stains on tired bed cover etc i am sorry guys but it was total disappointment except friendly reception girl forgot her name is it really star hotel or booking com made a mistake adding two more stars
