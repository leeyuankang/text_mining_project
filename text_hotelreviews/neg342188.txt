what i didn t like was of a personal preference i like a face cloth there were none the temperature could be a little cooler i prefer a cold room i also like a top sheet rather than a comforter i think you are a pet friendly hotel which is a problem for me as i am allergic to pets and sneezed the whole time i was in the room there is a no smoking policy for those who don t like the smell of cigarettes what about those of us who have health issues from pets i was hoping i could manage this as i was part of a group travelling for a family reunion but know from now on that i cannot put myself in this situation again the hotel is lovely but this was why it didn t receive top marks from me
