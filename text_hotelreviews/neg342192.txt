i had booked a comfort double room but on arrival the clerk at the desk gave us a smaller room on the floor not a bad room all in all but with a very small bathroom not what i had booked i returned to the front desk and showed them photos of the room from my booking com account on my phone the new room i was given no extra charge of course was the one in the photo however the photos on the web site are masterfully taken in reality the room is spacious but if you pay attention to the details it s stars at best all in all the rooms are quite ok but not as luxurious as the photos make you believe
