the attitude of the personal when we came they cheated on us and provided the wrong room which was worse then we booked it was absolutely not the room we wanted the lady from reception didn t want to change the room without adding some money when we started to search for another hotel she accidentally found out that there was one vacant room for us our room wasn t cleaned for two days despite the note on the door open for cleaning there was no dental kit shampoo and conditioner slippers and bathrobe the hotel with stars should have it all the balcony was very dirty with spiders and dust but the view was pretty so we tried not to notice this disadvantage
