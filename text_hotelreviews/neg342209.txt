in general hotel personnel especially some receptionists are helpful and they care some are very good but sometimes this is not the case for example housekeeping maid took the used water glasses in the morning and they were not replaced with the clean ones in the evening we called reception they immy switched to room service after a detailed explanation that we don t need tea just empty glasses they promised to bring ones but nothing followed room cleaning quality very much depends on the house keeping maid who does the room cleaning at this very day
