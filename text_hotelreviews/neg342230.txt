even though i thoroughly booked with a mail a car to wait for me and my family at my arrival at vienna hotel it did not appear the explanation i got later at the hotel reception desk was that the mail came late to them so they did not have time to organise it i send my mail with all the needed details the previous day so this explanation was not good for me it is another story when somebody paid attention to it if at all i had to find my own way to the hotel which was easy though i was in vienna many times before i wanted it just because the kid was tired from the early get up and the flight which was her first not so much for my convenience eve though i was also traveling with a large suitcase and a folding trolley for the kid quite bulky as you can imagine therefore i did not like the vain sorry about that to my complain at the reception the restaurant is ok but i expected much much more good that there are plenty of other restaurants around the hotel at my check out i kindly asked my lufthansa miles more card to be verified accordingly since i actually did the hotel booking with it i was refused with the explanation that i have to check it with lufthansa i kindly asked them to connect me with lufthansa in order to do that at the spot i was refused with that as well very very impolite i checked with lufthansa m m in sofia they were surprised but advised me to check with booking com a lot of checking and still no result i still do not have my miles for the hotel booking in my card
