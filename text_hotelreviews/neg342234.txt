the room we booked was a standard double it was nothing like the photos old bad furniture stains on the carpet and had not properly been cleaned for a long time there was dust on surfaces and fittings however the worst was the bed as is not uncommon in austria the double bed was two queen sized beds pushed together which was not a problem the issue was the mattresses we have never slept on softer and less comfortable mattresses anywhere no support at all just a hole to sink into the pillows were thin and offered no support either even with two together we had the most uncomfortable night s sleep ever and both woke up with back pain in the morning we complained and were offered the choice of a room upgrade at euro per night where we were assured that the beds would be better alternatively they said we could move to another room of the same standard which might have different mattresses we were not prepared to pay extra for a better room a comfortable mattress should be a given for any room in a supposed star hotel so looked at the alternative room offered while the mattresses appeared somewhat firmer the room was tired with stains on the floor and damaged furniture we therefore cancelled our further three nights and moved to a similarly priced hotel elsewhere which we were very happy with as we were leaving the concierge told us that we should have known what to expect if we booked a budget room presumably he meant a dirty tired room and an uncomfortable bed we have travelled a lot all over the world at reasonably priced hotels and have stayed at many hotels in vienna this was without doubt the most disappointing overall hotel experience we have ever had what we expected to be a good value weekend in a lovely hotel turned out to be something very different even a budget room euro per night in this case so hardly the cheapest should be clean and comfortable
