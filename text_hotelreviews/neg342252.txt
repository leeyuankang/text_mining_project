looking at the hotel i had the impression that the hotel has seen better days in the past the room furtniture was a bit worn out the service was slow probably the shortcoming of every large hotel absence of any personal touch it seamed for me also that the hotel is used for mass tourist group just for nights which of course does not make the hotel personnel to be more welcoming the evening restaurant in the hotel is rather pricy and the food is not someting special there are hundreds of places in vienna where you can eat really good not recommended
