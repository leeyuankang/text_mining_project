the room was rather basic with old furniture and kind a s design i expected it to be more historical a themed picture on the wall at least since the hotel promotes itself as the former guesthouse of the habsburgs i would advise them to work a bit on this experience design i believe we were not the only once who chose this hotel based on this feature
