the staff was as good as unhelpful on the contrary the manager was an extremely rude person who didn t understand the fact that he was working in the hospitality industry on asking for basic things like tea bags he created an issue and was borderline derogatory in his conduct i would definitely like to lodge a complaint with the hotel management to improve their staff
