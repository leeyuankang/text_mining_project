we had problems with the first room we were given and it took hours to resolve not impressed with the response from reception customer facing staff the first room we were given had foul odour of damp and bathroom shower drain smelt very badly upon reporting the smell the reception staff agreed to move us without question but the hotel was fully booked so we were told we had to wait hours to be moved the reception staff were out of any other options solutions to the long wait other than suggesting a room spray which was frustrating more frustrating was that reception staff refused to come inspect the room despite our insistence felt that the reception staff were not interested in understanding the problem or it s causes despite asking us to sit tight for hours once moved the second room was fine
