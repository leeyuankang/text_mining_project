the hotel has become way too large there are now five buildings and it was too long of a walk to the lobby after weeks in cozy hotels around austria this was cold and impersonal also the traffic in front of the hotel was so heavy that the exhaust fumes kept us from sitting out on the terrace the hotel itself was clean and comfortable and the food was good
