attitude of reception staff who did not want to allow me to unload luggage from our car at the front of the hotel i did it anyway the porter was especially helpful when i attempted to get breakfast the service was poor we were ignored the staff chose to serve others who came in after us and then proceeded to clear the tables rather than take our order in the event we chose to go next door for breakfast where the service was excellent the reception staff were not very informative on our arrival choosing to tell us to read everything rather than talk to us about anything
