the bathroom was ridiculously small it was like walking into a cupboard there were no amenities just squeeze bottles of liquid soap in the shower and sink this doesn t seem appropriate for a four star hotel the toilet didn t look clean and there was hair in the drawer the bath was high and it was difficult to get in and out to have a shower we were expecting some luxury and got a basic room we waited minutes to get a soft boiled egg made at breakfast and an omelette which wasn t even cooked properly we were very disappointed in this hotel as we were expecting some level of luxury due to the price we paid we didn t get this at all at checkout we weren t even farewelled or asked how our stay was
