upon arrival the reception staff was very rude and unhelpful when we asked the man at the reception to check it he went through the usual procedure and then gave us the room keys and waved his hand towards the general direction of the room no explanation about the hotel no breakfast times no map of the city nothing turns out he had given us the wrong room category and we had to go back and explain that we had booked the higher category he said no we hadn t even though i was holding the reservation confirmation right in front of him for some reason he thought we were lying he then referred us to his colleague without apologizing luckily his colleague gave us the right room and was friendlier but no helpfulness over the hotel facilities or city information the price does not include breakfast which is also a little unpractical having to find places nearby
