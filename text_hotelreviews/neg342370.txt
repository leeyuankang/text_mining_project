the cleaning should be done more seriously days after our arrival we have discovered a dirty pair of man s underwear on a shelf in our wardrobe also we were spoiled by the hotel with a cup of chocolate but despite the fact we have drunk it in our first day in wien the emply and dirty cup was in our room for the rest of our holiday for days long the parking is possible only at an underground garage right next to the hotel but the fee is high
