not the best restaurant experience inside the hotel we had an early dinner and even though the restaurant had only three tables with guests the service was horrible we felt the young waiter was unsuitable on the two occasions we ate in the hotel our mistake for going back as the hotel is surrounded by very good restaurants breakfast was very good though with friendly staff this being said i will give the hotel another try everyone has a bad day or two and most everything else was excellent
