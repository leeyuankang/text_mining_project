there are rooms in this star hotel with no air conditioning i booked on booking dot com where a c isn t mentioned in the room description but then again neither is toilet paper one would just expect this to be a basic facility at a star hotel a very snotty person in charged told me that it is only logical that if it is not mentioned it s not present they gave us room where the a c went on at with a huge noise and after visits to the front desk it was turned off since there was no way to turn it off in the room my thanks to mr ismir with a much politer attitude than his colleague
