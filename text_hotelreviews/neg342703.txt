we requested one large bed and we had beds one next to the other one but the real problem was that the beds were moving easily especially over the night creating a big hole between them they have a room for laundry cleaning that is available for rent by the clients the problem was that every time we went to the reception to ask for the key they said that the room is not available at the moment except one time only when the key was available but was like pm they could dispose more than one room considering the size of the hotel or they should think to add a laundry service
