we stayed in a triple room and our third single bed was a bit too short even though we had the triple room we found the facilities in the kitchen only for we stayed only one night but i am sure that you can ask for extras to the reception if needed the hotel is a bit too far from the city center but it has an easy access to it by bus i guess breakfast is a bit too expansive euros we didn t had breakfast so i can not tell if it might worth the money
