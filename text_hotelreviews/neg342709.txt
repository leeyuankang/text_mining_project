staff was pretending to be helpful however when we complained about our room smelling a lot of tobacco they said impossible and refused to relocate us due to being fully booked before asking we checked they had free rooms that night but sitting in the bar after i observed the staff going to booking com and removing free rooms they don t speak english at all room was very dirty and no cutlery in the kitchen should ask in reception but again no english so don t count on cooking as we were they promised good cleaning the day after but as can be seen on pictures that didn t happen you need to be very lucky to get parking low sound insulation so we could hear the parties on our floor this felt like or max star hotel
