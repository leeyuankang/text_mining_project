the parking is a joke the street of the hotel is very small and can only accommodate a small numbers of cars if you arrive at the hotel before people that live on the street return from work you should find a free parking space if not you will have to pay euro day at the hotel parking so hotel parking is not free however if you arrive before pm you will find a free parking space on the street and you can reach the center by bus
