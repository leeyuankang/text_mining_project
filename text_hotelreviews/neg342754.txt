quite far from the main attractions a bus ride takes about min there is a free public parking but be aware that finding a place is next to impossible as the hotel is located in a big residential area so be prepared to pay a hotel parking there is a small supermarket m away no cafes or restaurants experienced an issue on arrival as our room hadn t been cleaned took some time to change a room cleaning is definitely to be improved in this hotel
