we landed at vienna airport quite late when we arrived at the hotel the girl at reception said she thought there was no parking space left in their garage we went back to the car to try to find a place outside the hotel we could not find one and went back to the hotel there was another person at the reception who went through the trouble to check the garage as it turned out there were plenty of spaces at the garage the stuff at reception could have been more helpful
