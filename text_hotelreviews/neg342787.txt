this hotel is damn so far from the city center believe me that it takes almost one hour to go to the city center you have to catch the bus number which comes just per times per one hour and goes directly to karlsplatz or you have to wait for the bus to go to the metro station am sch pfwerk station at line this is the nearest metro station which is km far from the hotel if you are in business trip and if you have to go to the work every morning just stay away from here the staff is not so polite they are just doing their job and that s all the rooms are not so clean actually the room was cleaned every day but it is not perfect just ordinary done job there is not a market in almost km radius of the hotel there is just a little market inside the fuel farm close to the hotel and it is an expensive one because you know that these markets in the fuel stations are always expensive
