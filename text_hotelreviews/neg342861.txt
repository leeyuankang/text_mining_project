the services provided by the hotel staff need serious improvement when we arrived our room was prepared for only one person although we booked a double room the reception guy gave us one more set of sheets and we had to make one bed ourselves the second day when we arrived in the evening we saw that our room wasn t cleaned garbage was not removed and towels were not changed the reception sent the cleaning lady to fix the situation but our bad impression was already formed
