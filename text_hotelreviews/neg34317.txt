the mattresses on the beds collapsed causing the beds to slant in one direction even after bringing it to the staff s attention nothing was done about it one spent the night sliding off one side of the bed our water glasses weren t washed after being used the first night i was told i could leave a mug from the dining room in our room but it was never removed or washed and it remained there until we checked out central heating was too hot compared to the other hotels with the same rating we stayed at during this trip le marcel was not up to standard
