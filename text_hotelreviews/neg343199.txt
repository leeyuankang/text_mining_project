check in questionnaire was like a test sheet i am a smoker and know that there is no smoking in hotels however i was told i had to smoke outside in the morning i realized that there was a lovely courtyard where you could sit have coffee or cocktails and smoke although smoking is an unpopular and hot topic simply telling me that the courtyard was available would have been much preferred but we had a wonderful time and i would highly recommend the hotel
