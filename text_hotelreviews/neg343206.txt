the hotel treated me like i wasn t good enough there was a white couple before me that were treated like royalty but when it was my turn i was treated like garbage i won t recommend this hotel if your not white when i asked about a smoking room since i read somewhere that the hotel used to provide them i was given the stink eye and told there are no smoking rooms talk about an attitude problem i asked if i could have a room with a balcony and was told no directly didn t even search his computer and was given a room on the first floor it was horrible because i felt unsafe as there was a connection to another room from the outside and i like keeping my windows open for fresh air so i couldn t do that either no one told me my package included breakfast so that was out even though in the end i found out that it was included when i went in the room it was marginally better than a star hotel but i found a few pubic hairs in the bathroom i wish i was joking it was disgusting but since i was treated so poorly i didn t want any problems so i stayed quiet my holiday was a nightmare from hell and i wish i had my mom she s better at confrontation than i am i hated my stay there and i would recommend you never stay there not for the same prices given by better hotels in locations closer to the city center i hope someone from the hotel reads my review and someone gets fired i know that s mean but someone needs to lose their job or i need a refund i didn t spend almost euros to be given the worst room and treated like garbage
