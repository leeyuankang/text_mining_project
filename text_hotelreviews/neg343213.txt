for the price we paid and the announced stars i was not happy finding out that the carpet all over the hotel is old stained and smells although the room was good sized everything was old and in need of repairs walls were cracked or had holes carpet was stained all over there was not one single lamp that worked fine and in one case we had to unplug the power cord to turn it on and off the expensive breakfast was just enough with small portions considering the amount of guests and for which you had to wait even to find again some fruit about the cleaning although a message in the bathroom said that to save energy guests were invited to request the towels exchange only when needed by placing them on the floor we found out that every day for days they were replaced even when we never put them on the floor in addition the hotel should have informed in advance about the works ongoing just in front of it in the canal
