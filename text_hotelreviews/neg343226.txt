upon arrival no effort had been made to follow my booking request for twin rooms and single we ended up with singles a twin and double rooms with uncomfortable put up beds this despite myself and booking com giving clear instructions i was simply advised that rooms are twin or double in this case we have given you double my airing of disagreement met with distain and we were made to wait whilst the receptionist with an air of gruffness arranged a porter to put camp beds in rooms at a night i expect more this hotel was no better than a premier inn back in the uk expected a far better experience for the cash spent rooms dated and corridors smelt of tobacco on floor
