i have a complain with this hotel booking when i have made the booking of this hotel the breakfast was not offered as optional option saying there is no meal option with this room so i could not book the breakfast for persons when we have arrived at the hotel the receptionist was surprised that we don t have asked for breakfast of course we asked imediately as usual because we are not eating from the luggage our surpise was at the end when we had to pay for persons days breakfast this is a very tricky way to take more money from the clients which is unacceptable you as booking com should show that the breafast is so expensive kind regards peter wisky
