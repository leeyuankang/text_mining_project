arrived pm were told room would not be available until pm just take a seat in crowded waiting room off loungers this hotel is very popular with large groups got emails sorted rang london friends and then at pm requested our bags be stored as we were going to lunch was informed our room was ready and was assisted by a receptionist with a very different approach to the original one who by now had disappeared we requested a very early wake up call on our last of nights you guessed it we were told we never requested this after we appeared over hour late which resulted in rushed and chaotic transport to the airport it was only when we arrived at fort canning hotel singapoe we noticed an email from the reception manager that our complaint was correct and they had a failure in their system which effected more than us there are better hotels in craven hill nearer paddington where there are many more accessible eateries in a village atmosphere not on a major roundabout i would recommend that every person who works in reception at this hotel take a holiday to singapore and study the manners diligence and attitude of the staff at fort canning hotel maybe even mamagement could use the stay as a refresher course
