the only thing i didn t like and i would like to point out this is just my own personal preference was the bed it was far to hard for me i need a bed with a little bit more give in than being as hard as a rock also the pillows bascially did nothing you leant on them and it was like you weren t sleeping on any pillows at all plus the walls between rooms were not very soundproof saturday evening we were joined by a family in the adjoining room who had an over excitable child who couldn t didn t know how to keep his voice down
