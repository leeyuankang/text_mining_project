there is no free wifi in the room the room service gets sometimes confused and chaotic you need to call them repetitively in general it felt more like a regular in terms of staff experience though the check in and check out were extremely efficient the rest of staff was ok but not extra helpful or cheerful you do not get that personalized feeling or warm welcoming face when coming back or going out one feels very anonymous
