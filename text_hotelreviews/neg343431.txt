worst bed i ve ever slept in hairs in the bath which was chipped no sockets next to the bed which made using my cpap machine difficult i managed to find a single socket under the bed which saved the day only one bathrobe when there were two of us and couldn t believe the room was labelled a luxury twin i felt i was in an old room designated for those of us who used a booking site the light shade over the bed was stained and the whole room looked tired won t be back
