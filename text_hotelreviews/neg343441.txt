under hotel car parking is convenient but a number of the spaces are small and access is not easy the restaurant is only available for breakfast dining is in the bar we had to work hard to get a space set for us to eat we were not warned in advance and certainly when i questioned reception about booking into the restaurant they did not advised me it was bar only meals
