the room was small although this was expected in london the shower flooded the bathroom every time it was used although we were able to use towels to stop this it was a small annoyance the ice machine on our level did not work it was advised that there was a menu in the room for room service there was not the room was cold even the heating was cold the second night i ended up using a towel as an extra layer in bed the duvet didn t stretch over the two of us and my partner slept with the sheet as the duvet didn t completely fill the bedding the bed felt cheap but was okay our main complaint is with dinner we entered the more relaxed bar for dinner and sat down and noticed everyone around us not too busy was receiving table service we waited and waited for someone to take our drink order no one even said hello after waiting minutes my partner went to the bar and ordered our drinks and also requested a menu and advised the staff that we eating our drinks were brought over to us while we decided what to eat again we waited and waited and no one came to take our order even though we had been told that they would my partner again got up and tried to order a few moments later the supervisor came and took our order we ordered two pricey steaks i thought after this we would be taken more seriously we were warned of the minute wait on food and this was fine when our food was brought to us i don t think that the waiter could have got away even faster if he tried we were offered no condiments at all my partner again had to get up and ask for salt i had ordered my steak medium rare i know this offends some people but i hate blood in my food this apparently offended the chef as my steak was more medium rare no one came to check if everything was okay with our food and by this point we had just given up on the service
