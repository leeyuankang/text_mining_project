the double bed was awful it could creaked every time which woke my sister up every time i got up i could feel the springs on my back the spacing between the bed and the wall where the tv is mounted was a lot smaller than we were expecting and made it difficult for both of us to go to and fro the room was cold although was told that the entire heating system was turned off because everyone felt hot i don t think our heat fan was throwing out cold air an extra blanket was provided on the second night the cleaners made such a racket in the morning waking us up abruptly there was lots of slamming and door bashing had to literally shout out loud to stop the banging our mugs with leftover tea from the night before were left just covered with the paper lid had to call reception twice to get a set of new mugs overall we were a little disappointed i wish we said something about the bed in the room if this would have been better i would consider staying again since the location was brilliant
