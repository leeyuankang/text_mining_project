the room standard was poor for a hilton the first room i was allocated was unusable as the bathroom door didn t open sliding door the second room was small and lacked the feel of quality i expect from a hilton it was more like a travel lodge quality room the room overall felt in need of refurbishment it was just a bit grubby
