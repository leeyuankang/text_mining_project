the facilities are shockingly stale worn tired and definitely overrated given the reviews this place gets and the cost definitely do not stay on level which is mildewy and decrepit the double deluxe room was pokey cramped and unclean the toilet bowel stained the fridge was barely colder than the outside air the room service poor having stayed at a number of hiltons such as sydney george st and a number of art series hotels i can say this hotel is definitely sub par
