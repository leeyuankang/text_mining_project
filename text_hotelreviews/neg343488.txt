when i arrived they couldn t find my booking even though i showed my confirmation email very worrying minutes as i was travelling with my old grandson who got quite worried at the concierge desk there is writing on mirrors with coloured markers which i thought was quite tasteless tacky to be honest didn t think it gave a good impression of the image reputation expected of the hilton tv in bedroom didn t have a signal but to be honest i didn t report this as by time we got in from sight seeing shopping my grandson was too tired anyway
