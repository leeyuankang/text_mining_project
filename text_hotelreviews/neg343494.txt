trouble reaching room service tv not functioning due to a plug not being all the way in and that s where room service menu is located maintenance was quick and very cheery to fix our broken tv the very best employee interaction of our entire visit then room service wouldn t pick up the phone had to ring through front desk to get them our room had wood panels replacing marble in the bathroom the bath was in need of an overhaul and the maids kept it very clean but it was noticeably shabby the concierge who serviced our bags while we were out was rude and abrupt both times we engaged with him not a good fit for a concierge position he was on a personal call when we first approached when we returned he couldn t find our bags and we had to go hunt for them i m usually very charitable on employee reviews but we had mediocre restaurant service with a very long wait for the food and downright rude concierge assistance
