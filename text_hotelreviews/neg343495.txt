the hotel was very filthy i stayed for an overall nights the coffee i poured myself in the room on the first day of check in was still sitting in my room days later not cleaned after complaining to the manager i was promised increased diligence will be taken the following day on cleaning guess what i found in my room the next evening same cup of coffee this happened an additional time during my short night stay the carpet was filthy with hair from previous guests i presume the rooms are very small particularly if your are targeting customers coming to shop as there s barely enough room to place your bags and still manage to manoever around the room however small rooms are manageable but cleanliness for the amount of money paid is a non negotiable i picked up bites on my legs that are now very easy to attribute to the levels of unhygienic rooms
