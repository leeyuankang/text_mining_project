the hotel advertises free wifi but conveniently forgets to leave out the fact that the wifi in the rooms is not free what is the point as i booked the hotel based on free wifi for work purposes the gym is very old and outdated and not very clean i chose this hotel because it had a gym the lifts sometimes did not work as it was not registering room cards
