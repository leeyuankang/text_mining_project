room advertised as double but was a small double and the room itself was extremely cramped if i was aware of the room size on ordering i would have gone for another option the walls were paper thin and we could hear everything from all four adjoining rooms left right above and below i mean hear everything the proposed cost for guest wifi was ridiculous basic internet should be included as standard disappointed there was not a bath and while the shower was a good enough size the aging seals in the shower door were black and quite unseemly the bathroom door did not close properly breakfast the food itself was lovely good selection and plenty on display however while there was a large number of staff working the breakfast there was quite a delay in any of the ordered options the coffee machines coffee was luke warm at best that could have been bad luck with one of the three machines available dinner service was very slow during dinner in the bar restaurant had an issue with the food we ordered which was addressed at the time by the manager on duty however i wouldn t chose to eat there again nor would i recommend it dinner issues v slow service poor wait staff food was dropped into my lap on arrival starter overdone to the point of being rubbery burger was so greasy that it leaked a significant pool onto the table to the point that it totally soaked my napkin when i cleaned it up
