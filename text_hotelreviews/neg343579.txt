the room was very warm even when we had the heating air conditioning i m not sure which one was it was in the room on the cooler settings the light on the coolest setting of the heating air conditioning didn t light up blue as the light on the second coolest did so it was difficult to know if the heating air conditioning was on and there was a stain on the carpet by the table where the window was it looked like a tea or coffee stain and the chair at the table that you sat on with the mirror in front of you had a red nail varnish stain on it but other than that i can t fault the room the two stains are small details which is why i gave the hotel a for cleanliness i also gave the hotel a for comfort because our room was very warm even when we had the heating air conditioning on and the light on the coolest setting of the heating air conditioning didn t work as previously stated
