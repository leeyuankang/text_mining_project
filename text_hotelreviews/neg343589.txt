the room was soo tiny and dusty i think they gave us a double single use because when we arrived the vanity set was only for person and even the bed was just a little bit bigger then a single one we found cobwebs near radiator at our arrival really big i didnt sleep at all because of the dust hitch i have dust allergies and because of cobwebs we arrived late so we made a complain only the following day reception staff was very nice they wanted to set up another room for us but only for one night i didnt want moove so they clean the room better and exept for the tiny bed i could sleep the second night
