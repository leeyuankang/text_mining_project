the hotel is very dated and needs an urgent upgrade lobby reception and bar area are just about ok still but the rooms are very dated and are not very clean the bathroom as well was not up to standard and cleanliness in this hotel is really a problem the carpets are dirty all over wall paper coming loose everywhere and the floor we stayed on smelled terrible
