the room was very small very dirty carpet and armchair outdated bathroom in our day there no one came to clean our room we had to buy our own shower gel which i think is unacceptable for a hotel on the day we have asked for shower gel and toilet paper they came to clean the room around not to mention that we had no cover for the bed no extra blankets one of the days the cleaning service knocked the door once at and entered the room without even waiting for an answer or anything well we were sleeping and it was really unpleasant
