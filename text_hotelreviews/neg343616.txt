the pathetic front office personnel who would need to be more courteous and needs proper training lack of manpower in the front office making guests stand in queue for long the housekeeping personnel are equally pathetic with little or zero knowledge of english and working in a hotel in london hardly takes care of the cleanliness of rooms and toilets bathrooms atleast train them to speak english which is the least one can expect in a hotel in london
