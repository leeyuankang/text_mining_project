i chose the most expensive executive suite on booking com to make sure the quality of the room for my boss i went there before to try to have a look but were refused which i could understand that the room was occupied by other guests i didn t go to the hotel again and insist to check the suite before because i trust hilton but when i checked in i found it s not a real suite at all the suite is composed by two single rooms actually and the most ridiculous thing is that i got the room key from the bedroom which becasue it is nearer to the lift the bedroom is really small as others the space between the large bed and the tv is too narrow to turn around for a normal size adult and the door inside to the living room is too small to be recognised at first glance therefore you can imagin when we opened the door and people wanted to walk in the room followed my boss how embarrassed and upset and uncomfortable we were at that moment obviously there is no enough space for us at all and there is no chance for us to sit down and to have a causal chat with my boss during his trip because we should pass by his private bedroom there is another door from the living room can be used only i knew it when i checked out three days later but the living room s door is far more away to the lift which you could not want to use it anymore it s the first time my boss went to london for a business trip after hours direct flight i don t want to mention how disappointed and sad i was and how unsatisfied my boss was again generally hilton hotel is what we trust and use all over the world but i will certainly not choose it in london next time
