a big bottle of water waiting for me with a nasty price tag on it my last few trips to london were to a more modest hotel where you get two free bottles of water every day the bathroom wasn t up to much considering the pretensions of the place the shower was in the bath and you have to figure out while you re standing in it which tap to twist for hot water risking a neckful of scalding water if you get it wrong i didn t include breakfast in my stay although i got the impression i had when i booked i chose to have breakfast there two mornings i asked at reception how much this would be and was told pounds it turned out to be why not just say it s twenty quid the breakfast is as chaotic as any other hotel i ve been to in other words the customer has to do all the work of fetching and carrying and stand over a machine to get toast which doesn t toast the first time so you stand there in the presence of two or three other guests doing the same i got back to the table with my toast to find my knife had been cleared away with my plate i asked a member of staff where i would get cutlery he didn t know what i d said i asked another could i get a tray to avoid too many comings and goings she just repeated the word tray back to me dumbfounded the staff were just there to clear off tables customers were a bit beyond them
