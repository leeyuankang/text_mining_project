i ordered a hiltons vip package as it was my daughters birthday but for what it was i thought it was over priced and this didn t arrive till after we went out at so when we got back to the room it was late and we were tired she couldn t eat the cake but we could at least take the mini bottle of wine home they didn t decorate the room like they said and she didn t get a bottle of fizz but got a mini white and a mini red bottle of wine and a plate decorated with happy birthday and small triangles of brownies i m just putting it down to experience
