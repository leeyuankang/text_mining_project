no internal stairs my daughter doesn t go in lifts so although it wasn t a problem going down as she could access the barred door from the inside every time we returned to the hotel i had to go to the concierge to ask him to let her in whilst she waited outside the concierges were without exception very obliging but it was inconvenient
