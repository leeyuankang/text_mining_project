poor reception did not have my room booked back in august and a late check in arranged too few staff on reception long waiting time provided an alternative on floor key did not work back to reception waited in queue again then another minutes for the concierge to take us to our room upgraded to a room that did not have the correct number of beds staff seemed surprised we weren t pleased with the upgrade staff returned with key to another upgrade a twin room which was what was booked in the first place so basically took an hour before we were checked in with a bed to sleep in the worst hilton reception and check in i have ever experienced
