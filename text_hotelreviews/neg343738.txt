the huge price tag was definitely not worth it there were no facilities at the hilton that wouldn t have been available at a premier inn or travelodge as a chain which represents luxury stays i really do not believe i received a luxury stay there were no lamp shades on the lamp the bottom of the bathroom door was scuffed and needed a lick of paint the view from the room was awful over looking a block of flats and a lot of little things were lacking not what you expect when paying per night for a stay ridiculous and not impressed
