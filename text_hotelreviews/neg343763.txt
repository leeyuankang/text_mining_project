staff receptionist at the front desk is extremely rude and possibly racist room we were given a room catered for disabled people which we do not understand why bathroom is extremely uncomfortable and there are emergeny strings everywhere which made us feel extremely nervous shower room as it is catered for disabled people cannot be closed and therefore we had caused a flooding in that area sink is extremely low causing back aches one of our friend had it worst he was given a single room but he paid for a double room the bed is too small for him and he did not have hot water in the shower bottled water in the room is not complimentary we didn t mind paying for it but the next day the empty bottle was not replaced upon check out the receptionist said that the water is actually complimentary but the next day one of my friend saw on his credit card statement that the water was actually charged on his card hotel restaurant is mediocre waiters are slow and forgot ignored our requests and they do not know what tartare sauce and tabasco sauce are food is below average and high priced the list goes on but i think everyone had an idea on our overall experience there not a star hotel
