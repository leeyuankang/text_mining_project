the room we were initially placed in had completely non functional air conditioning non functional hot water and an un openable fridge when returning to our room to sleep after popping out for a late bite to eat on arrival in london with a toddler this made our lives very difficult after a failed attempt at repair eventually by a technician and being offered a fan the room was way to hot an opressively humid for us let alone our child we finally got moved to an alternative room having a very over tired toddler by this stage we got almost no sleep partly writing off our next day in london we specifically decided to pay the premium price to stay at a hilton property based on previous good experiences at hilton properties and the desire to have a hassle free stay for our last stop in the uk we didn t really get that out of this stay our additional dollars could have been better spent on other aspects of our trip the maintenance technician did advise us at one point the room had known issues and knowing this it should not have been selected for use i won t say we will never stay at the hilton again but i might think twice
