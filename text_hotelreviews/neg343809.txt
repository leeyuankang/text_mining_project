sadly this was a major let down as far as a hilton hotel is concerned and i have stayed in many so to say i was shocked is an understatement the carpet hadn t been hoovered there were stains everywhere including in the curtains the bathroom had rust and the air vent was covered in dust and had clearly not been cleaned prior to our arrival not to mention i was locked out of the hotel and not allowed in as i did not know my room number despite me advising the staff member via intercom that i had not looked at the door number due to me arriving at checking literally putting our bags in and immediately leaving as it was nothing hill carnival he then went on to argue with me until another hotel guest kindly stated their door number and only then were we able to gain access this was gone so he could have potentially placed me and my friend as females in a vulnerable position as were were locked out onto the street that we were not familiar with baring in mind we paid for this hotel this review could go on but i think i have made my point i am disgusted
