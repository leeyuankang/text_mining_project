staff at breakfast were rude i felt unwell they had run out of water so asked for water and for if to be brought to the table staff member said i ll get some it will be up there pointing to its counter position i thought a four star and above hotel has to give you table service if you request it even if they offer a buffet style breakfast when i went to get the water using its wine cooler stand a staff member came over wipped away the cooler leaving the bottle on the table without saying a word rude reception staff were brilliant the gentlemen that checked us in on arrival went above and beyond allocating our rooms together for my friends celebration stay and he remembered us when we checked out asking us about our weekend he was the hotel s saving grace
