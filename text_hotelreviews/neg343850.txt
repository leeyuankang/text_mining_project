i didn t like that free wifi in room was not available to guests if the hotel was booked through booking com even though i am a hilton honours member i was shocked and certainly not about to pay almost a day for it that s total robbery also no points would be attributed to my membership for the stay again because i booked through booking com instead of the hotel website the rooms of this particular hilton had a somewhat dated feel there were cracks around my doorway the bathroom was tiny and it just didn t feel as nice as other hilton s i ve stayed at in london there were no bathrobes or slippers available in my room something i have come to expect from hotels of this standard
