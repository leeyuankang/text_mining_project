the hotel itself is very tired and could do with a complete revamp considering it has the hilton name the fridge in our room was dirty very old not cold and had a disgusting smell we rang the reception and we were given a replacement fridge in our room it was cold very old and made a terrible noise and was just placed in the room near the desk which took up space in our room the door would not close to our room when leaving unless you had your keycard inserted in the slot and slammed it there were two phones in the room the one that was by the bed was old antiquated and not working and should have been removed when they installed a more modern phone on the desk
