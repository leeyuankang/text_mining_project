we checked in pretty late and would have loved a hot meal but no pizza was left as it was carnival hotel was very busy but i feel because of that they should have extra as we were all coming from carnival also after a long day at carnival was disappointed that sauna closed at an extension on that night would have been brilliant could not get to hotel earlier because by the time we had packed away equipment we did not arrive at hotel until and we all need the steam suana to relax after a long day
