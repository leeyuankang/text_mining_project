rooms are not much different to a travelodge except they are smaller they took the payment out of the wrong account i rang up times and was told that they would contact me back they didn t so i was then told to send an email i did and no reply so disappointed with the customer service after leaving a member of staff walked into my room whilst i was changing at the time i didnt mind but this along with the poor customer service has made me not want to stay again
