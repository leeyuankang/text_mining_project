first one of rooms was not ready for over an hour after the promised time and the hotel had fully charged our credit card a month before the trip then one room had water damage from the bathroom that is clearly visible on the carpet the other room didn t not have a working refrigerator i told the staff about it but they did nothing about it nor did they offer a solution or get back to me about the issue finally we paid for two double rooms and one room was smaller than the other as well as the bed
