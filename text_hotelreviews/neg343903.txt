the hotel room was cold and i was told that heating had been turned off but someone brought me a heater soon so that was good also the shower drain was blocked and needed to be fixed and it was done efficiently the hair dryer also broke down but again was replaced straight away worst of all no power plug in bathroom for hair dryer
