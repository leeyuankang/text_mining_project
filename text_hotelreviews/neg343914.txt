the hotel is getting a bit dated the rooms on the floor that we had were old s style dark wood fitted wardrobes but still solid enough once again the hotel is a trade off against price and location the gym is small but functional though there isn t a pool staffing levels appear to be a bit of an issue with queues for breakfast being quite long often waiting for tables to be cleared after diners have left the bar food service is also an issue pizzas ordered just after the kitchen closed took almost an hour not the minutes we were told when we ordered
