the staff are a little bit rude and abrupt we asked for a bowl and they were very hesitant it took ages for them to decide whether they could give us a bowl to take to the room when they decided to eventually give us a bowl it was the smallest bowl you could think of i then didn t even bother requesting a spoon and just drank my cereal
