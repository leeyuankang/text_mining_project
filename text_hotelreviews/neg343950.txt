i think they could be a bit more generous with the tea facilities with fresh milk on the fridge for drinks although i am guessing if we had asked i am sure this would have been accommodated there was not enough shower gel for two people if we wanted two showers one on arrival after a long journey and thenthe following morning nor was there bath foam for our use again if we had asked i am sure it would have been given to us
