find it hard to fault this hotel overall is a lovely hotel both location and welcome of guests room can be cosy but this is paris unless you pay more ive heard other reviews mention no coffee making facilities in the room but please this is paris with excellent coffee in cafes all over are literally steps from the hotel who on earth would want to sit in a room and drink processed coffee its mainly people from the north american continent that want coffee in a hotel room please nooooo
