i felt the room was ok but the first night was cold when we complained an engineer was sent up immediately to sort the problem and he also brought extra blankets the problem was sorted promptly good service i thought the room could have done with a bit of sprucing up but overall it was spotlessly clean and the beds were very comfortable i would definitely book again
