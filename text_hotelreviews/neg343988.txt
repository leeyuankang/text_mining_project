i can complain only about things internet normally there is no free wifi in the room only cable connection that you have to pay for we were offered free wifi for hilton hhonors members but connection was very poor signal was disappearing every few minutes or even seconds no free drinking water in the room these two things are so basic nowadays that a hotel like hilton should have them for free
