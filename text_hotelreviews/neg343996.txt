we was put right at the back not near the front so view wasn t nice and had to walk to long hallway from elevator with our daughter loads of bags and travel cot we only had a shower aswell so with a baby it was very hard to properly wash her and the room was a lot smaller when the last time we stayed was cheaper and we had a bigger room
