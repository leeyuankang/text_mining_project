the bed was so uncomfortable rock hard and very squeaky you sat on it and it made a noise plus the air con was very warm even on the lowest setting only other niggle is my husband is and struggled with the shower as its not a stand alone shower so he had to bend down slightly to use it and the fridge in the room didn t work but would stay here again as positives outweighed the small negatives
