not that i would mark the hotel down on this point we were offered a complimentary water for the room which we accepted but it wasn t broguht up to the room like they said it would be when calling down to reception the line didn t work so called room service only to be told it wasn t their department but they brought it up within the next half an hour so nothing really to complain about room not dirty but little bits of cleaning missed like dust around the bed but nothing too bad breakfast how ever was a ridiculous amount of money i wasn t prepared to pay per person for a fried breakfast don t think i could have eaten enough to make it worth it s money
