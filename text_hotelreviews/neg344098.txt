i have visited various hilton hotels around the world and was very disappointed by the standards of this hotel the hotel rooms were not acceptable for the price of our stay the bed size is far too small it was on wheels and made a creaking noise if you turned over the room size overall was very small and made our stay a lot less enjoyable overall disappointed with my stay
