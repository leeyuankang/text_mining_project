we had issues with bed and noise from air conditioning but staff was kind enough to swap rooms generally due to older building i was rather surprised to see the hotel quality as compared what i am used to in australia be prepared for rather low standard of the hotel if you have stayed in hilton elsewhere but staff friendliness makes it up hotel must consider upgrading the facilities as it is not very long that you will lose customer base
