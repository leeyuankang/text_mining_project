we arrived at the hotel early great they had a room for myself and husband but i had booked two twin rooms also so there was quite a bit of confusion to say the least as to the other two booked rooms why i don t seem to understand they seemed to say it was booking coms fault we finally got the two rooms which took quite a while and put a damper on the stay i am so glad that i had my paper work with me
