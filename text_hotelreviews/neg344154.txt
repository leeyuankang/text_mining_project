we went to london as a special treat for my sister s birthday i chose the hilton over other hotels and spent the extra cost to have a luxury stay at a reputable hotel compared to a budget hotel what we experienced was below the standard of even that the room had obviously previously been subject to a bathroom flood the carpet was stained from this and the room smelt mouldy the fridge was dirty the sink cracked and brown stains around the bath taps there was only enough milk for one person and had to ring for more there was tape residue left on the bottom of the bath where a mat had obviously previously been stuck and the decorating was of poor quality and was filthy around the skirting boards and door frames
