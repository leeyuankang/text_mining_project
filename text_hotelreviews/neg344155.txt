i booked nights with the knowledge that my flight arrives in london at i got into the hotel at and was kept at the reception for nearly hours nobody seemed to give us an answer to why we were not being given our rooms the management could clearly see that my wife had a broken arm and my daughter was tired the manager joseph smart was not helpful in any way shape or form i am totally disappointed as we ended up checking in at for a room i had paid for from the previous day at i had booked an executive suite the list he could offer was us using the executive lounge while we await for the keys but he declined to do that its managers like him who give the hilton a very poor name
