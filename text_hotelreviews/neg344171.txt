on entering the room it smelt musty and as though it hadn t been used in a while not good when attempting to order some fresh milk for my tea in the room was told by housekeeping that it would cost a little ridiculous told there was no fridge in the room and there was on trying to order fresh milk from reception when booking in was not helped just told to call house keeping when it could have been sorted from reception which was a shame as the phone connection was breaking up just think nothing should be too much trouble it wasn t rocket science after all
