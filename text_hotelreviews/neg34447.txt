the thermostat to my room was broken and the heater was on all day i informed the desk staff but all he could say was to open up the window there was no offer to relocate me to a different room that had a working thermostat with a cooling fan nor the offer to have engineer fix it just very poor customer service on his part i was there for nights sleeping with the window open and having trouble sleeping due to the street noise in order to have my room be cooled down a recommendation to not only have your staff trained properly but to also have all the amenities in the room in working order before checking any guests into a room
