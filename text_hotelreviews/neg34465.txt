in the evening the room was quite hot and there is no way to cool it off as you aren t able to open windows due to the noise in the street below the noise is fine during the day if you choose to leave the windows closed the windows block the noise very well it can also be enjoyable to listen to the sounds of the street during the day if you want a room without street noise they have them in the back of the building but those rooms are quite a bit darker
