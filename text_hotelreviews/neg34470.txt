we had room on the ground floor which was fine the entrance to the room was outside from the back of the hotel and when retuning at night felt the area was not well lit there was a sensor light but the light outside our room didn t seem to be working entrance area seemed to be for storage wifi didn t work in the room except near the door if you were on the bed wifi dropped out wifi range needs to be improved
