a massive width double bed but two individual duvets which are not as wide as a uk single bed duvet so periodically at night you woke up cold as the duvet had shifted away from you this is not just this hotel all in austria seem to do it a single lift is not enough at busy periods too much waiting around also if you are on an upper floor and signal to go down the lift stops on your floor even when it is going to higher floors confusing and annoying
