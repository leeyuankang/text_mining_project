it s a nice hotel in a great location i would definitely stay here again but i don t understand why it s rated as the decor and the cleanliness are more akin to a hotel e g chipped paint on doorframes dark carpets bathroom was clean but not sparkling in the way that you get with a also there wasn t a proper desk chair where you could do work only a bedside table without a chair
