mind the location it is just outside the city centre min walk to the fancy shopping area on graben kartner and stephansplatz all other sights are a lot further walk but from schwedenplatz you have metro or tram also taxi is very affordable the only thing was that the room was very warm it is on a central system so they couldn t adjust it and they had some renovation going on but this we hardly noticed
