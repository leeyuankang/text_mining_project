we found that the bar area the light fixtures had spider webs hanging from them and full of dust we were disappointed one evening as we came down for dinner and we were told that we could only eat in the bar area and a very limited tapa menu like items when we asked why we were told that they just had a bus full of people and that they were not serving any other guests in the hotel dinning room my husband and myself were upset as we are guests in this establishment the hotel should have plan to have food servings for there other guests in the dinning room or perhaps letting guests know in the morning that there would be no dining available and we could have made other plans to eat downtown in amsterdam this is very disappointing that it happen courtyard marriott
