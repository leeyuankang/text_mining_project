we were surprised to see bed n breakfast like service in such a big hotel brand and costly too there was no room service even we need to go and buy water bottle also from reception area at least a vending machine would have given the feel of descent bed n breakfast hotel but they were shamelessly selling the water bottles also from reception breakfast was also too simple not worth spending so much money for just a brand similarly clean bed n breakfast would be available at fraction of cost
