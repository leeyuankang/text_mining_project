the location to the city centre is quite far mins on the train further than i d appreciated which is my own fault for not researching better this hotel is really intended for visitors to the arena rather than the city itself mostly a problem for getting there at night either from the airport we landed late or from the city after a night out we ended up taking taxis times over the long weekend which adds up as a hidden cost eur per ride with and without uber
