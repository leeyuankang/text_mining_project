if you are going to charge to eat breakfast at the restaurant in the hotel you should at least provide a decent discount for the hotel guests we only ate dinner at the oa one time it wasn t bad but not worth the price it would have been nice to have the option to eat breakfast for a decent price for two people and or a family or even a complementary coffee per adult would have been nice the parking was overpriced also
