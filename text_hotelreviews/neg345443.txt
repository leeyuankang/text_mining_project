hotel staff weren t very helpful or clear we wanted to pay the outstanding balance in cash however when we got there we got told we would have to pay an extra if we wanted to pay cash this was not on any confirmation we didn t have enough money to do this so got told our only other option would be to give our credit card details and they would hold them on file for security reasons we gave our credit card details but advised that they would not be able to take money out of that account as that was where all our bills come out of they assured us over and over again that they would not debit the card however when i went upstairs to our room and used the wifi to check our internet banking the money had straight away been debited went back downstairs to complain about this after our previous conversation and was again assured that this would be sorted asap we were running out of time to sort this as had to be at the ziggo dome arena not long after this all happened but the next morning when we were checking out we paid our balances by cash and the lady realised she had infact debited the card by mistake something we were promised had not happened i did start to get very angry at this point and said it needs to be cancelled refunded it was an important bank etc etc she assured us she would cancel transaction and money would be back in bank within days we have returned back to the uk and although the money is back into our bank accounts we have been charged separate transactions from our bank for using our debit card while abroad something that we did not ask to do and was completely taking out of our hands we have been charged fee of fee of i would like this looked into if possible as we have been charged for no need and as per the shocking customer service and mistake we would like this refunded
