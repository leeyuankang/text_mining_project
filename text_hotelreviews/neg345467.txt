had to pay an extra on arrival incase we used any extras was not warned about this beforehand i had not got any more money in the bank so my partner had to pay it separately we were assured the money would go straight back onto the card after check out but it hasn t up to yet days later this has meant that we have incurred charged from the bank in addition the bathroom door has two big gaps either side so anyone else in the room can see through we were not asked once if everything was okay with our stay
