when my friend and i got to the hotel staff seemed extra rushed and were not very welcoming upon entering our room my roommate and i noticed that the room had not been or had been minimally cleaned there was bloody snot left on the curtains and there were chunks of black stuff in the shower the shower had the smell of vomit lingering i called hotel reception to complain from my cell phone and was told i d get a response after waiting minutes in the room we noticed that the phone in the room wasn t even functional when i went to reception it seemed like they were bothered and stressed at the fact that i had even requested a new room rather than being apologetic about it not sure if it s a difference in customer service by country but it didn t feel very welcoming total bummer from a hotel chain that is usually pretty solid in the us
