the receptionist at night ruined my stay completely the hotel states they provide room service and when i tried to order i was told the food has run out and there s no where to get food from until the morning he was verbally abusive and racist towards me he didn t have a name badge on and refused to give me his name we were then told we would have complimentary breakfast the following day to apologise for the way we were treated but that never happened someone walked into our room while we were sleeping then walked out the morning we were checking out the hotel claims to be close to the airport but it s mins away by taxi which was very expensive the food is beyond bland and disgusting i ordered a caesar salad and when it came it had loads of fish in it which it didn t state on the menu we ordered a margarita pizza and when it came there was eggs rocket and slices of tomato all over it the towels were left on the floor as advised when you want fresh ones and we had to call up and wait over an hour for clean towels generally a horrible experience and would never stay at a holiday inn again purely based on how badly we were treated
