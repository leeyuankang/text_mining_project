on arrival my cousin and i took a taxi to the the hotel the driver was very friendly but i thought the taxi seats did not look clean and i asked how much it would cost we were told it would be on the clock as we were traveling i looked for the clock and there was none to be seen on arrival he asked for fifty seven euros which for a twenty minute ride i thought that was a bit extortionate to us that was not a good start
