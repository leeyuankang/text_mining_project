i did not like the spiders this is the hotel i stay in so far this year and the total amount of spiders encountered in the other rooms was one in croatia at a week long stay and one in arnhem the netherlands at a day long stay the total amount of encountered spiders in the amadi hotel for this one night stay was only counting those we came across wandering about inside it is unpleasant to walk into spider webs indoors in your hotel room when i went to the bathroom during the night i also encountered some other bugs scattering around by the toilet which may explain why the spiders were so thrifty also we brought our own bath salts and we were seriously looking forward to enjoy a nice warm bath in the tempting and fancy tub obstacle one several curly hairs in the bathtub not very inviting led to a session of heavy tub scrubbing before even attempting to fill the tub obstacle two the water never got warm i endured a few minutes in the water anyhow as i had already poured my expensive bath salts in and didn t want them to get entirely wasted but the warmest water we got was actually not warm so the bath wasn t in any way relaxing tried warming up in the shower afterwards but it never got properly warm either
