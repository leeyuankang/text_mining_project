i have no idea how this is rated as a star hotel it is definitely the worst hotel i have ever stayed in the hotel and rooms were infested with hundreds of insects and there were dead bug carcasses all over the floor of our room see photo the carpet and bed linens were foul with bad smelling stains on them when we arrived see photos housekeeping does the bare minimum our sheets were stained carpet was filthy and we didn t even have enough towels we had such a horrible experience that we complained to the hotel manager every day we asked for one night to be refunded and they were too cheap to even do that for us the hotel is in a sketchy apartment building where the hotel rents a few floors so expect a strange and somewhat unsafe entrance which of course is bug infested also the hotel is minutes from the city at least so for the very undeservedly high price you pay to stay here you should definitely stay at another hotel with a much better location in summary avoid this hotel at all costs
