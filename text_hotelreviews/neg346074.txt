this hotel partitioned the top two levels into a hotel the other six levels belong to local residents the wall is not sound proof at all one night we hear clearly the snoring from the neighbour not to mention the door opening closing by the neighbours we requested an extra bed for my son via booking com but we have to pay extra euro per night this is the first time we face such situation very strange then we moved to the room and there is no extra bed so we had to sleep on the same bed with my son in a larger room and we received euro discount but both my wife and myself did not manage to sleep at all for the first night as my son keeped on kicking us and this particular room is not sound proof at all as if we sleep on the road we hear clearly the car noise for the whole night after we moved to our superior room with an extra bed very small considering what we paid it seems that this is amsterdam phenomenon we could sleep but i always need my earplug against the random noise from outside in general amsterdam is a very nice and attractive city among all eu cities the locals are very friendly people many high quality museums services of sightseeing are also very high quality excellent food all kinds it no doubt offers the best chinese food in europe as well while what i missed the most is the chicken salad in the maritime museum restaurant but somehow we were not so lucky that the receptionist who was our very first contact in amsterdam gave us an impression that to stay six night in amsterdam would be too long as amsterdam and holland are so small that there is not much to see this is very strange plus the sleepless fiat night we were really in doubt about our dicision afterwards but the overall experience in amsterdam was pretty good we would pay more attention to find a more suitable hotel if we come back again
