several situations went wrong firstly i had checked an extra bed and when i checked in they said that there was no extra bed available only at the end of the night they were able to solve the problem the hotel double charged the same room on my credit card then they could not return the excess amount i spent the two days trying to solve all these issues despite the mistakes the hotel staff always tried to resolve the issues and on the last day everything was right having the hotel offered the extra bed value as compensation for the problems that were created
