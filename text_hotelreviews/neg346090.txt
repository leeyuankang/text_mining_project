we booked a canceable room and they blocked i talked with my bank and they said that the hotel blocked this amount weeks before arriving it makes no sense for this rate the answer in reason of no show hello we booked a canceable rate that means you you do not need a guarantee our bed was splitted with mattresses surely you will fall in the middle if you turn at night and we talk here about in case the tv remote control falls in to this gap you wont ever see it again if you take a shower make sure that you wont flood the whole bathroom thats dangerous because the floor will get slippery the price for that what you get is definitely too high more and you sleep directly in the city without this problems and the hotel staff will give you a trust before blocking
