the room was way too warm we tried multiple times to turn the thermostat down but there was no change the bathroom had glass walls which was super modern but not practical at all you couldn t turn the light on in the bathroom during the night without illuminating the whole room the main light in the room did not work so the overall lighting in the room was poor all of that aside the worst part was that it was difficult to find the facility when we put the address into our navigation system it brought us into the middle of nowhere
