reception is on the floor but the rooms are on and you have to enter a building with apartments to get to the reception but we could not get in the apartment in the beginning could not find the door ring bell of the hotel outside the building we had to call booking com and then they reached the reception and the problem was solved the future guests should be aware of this so that they do not get confused breakfast was expensive so we did not get it
