our bathroom was devided in two parts the lights open in both at the same time the second part has no door so if you want to use the first part during night aha aha aha ha alellouiaaaa then if you want to wash your hands you have to go around through the room this is not good if you travell with a baby but for a couple i dont think is a big deal if you travel alone
