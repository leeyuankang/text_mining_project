we stayed in the family room which slept people it was comfortable but freezing we were cold both nights the reception gave a blow heater to use for our last night which we didn t feel safe leaving on all night this is my second time staying here and i find the staff quite cold and unwelcoming i m a massive believe in customer service in any role you do and the front of house staff seem uninterested and unhelpful customer service is key i simply can t stress this enough maybe smile more to begin with
