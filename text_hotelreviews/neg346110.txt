only thing i didn t like was the location which is quite far out of the centre there is a tram stop close by but definitely not walking distance to town and later at night we had to get taxis back which were quite expensive this is the main reason i did not rate the hotel good value for money as we had to spend quite a lot on taxis and transport also for the room price i thought breakfast should have been included but the hotel itself and the staff are great
