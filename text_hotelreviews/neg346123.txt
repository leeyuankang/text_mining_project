the room we had was kind of small i think they should keep the bigger rooms for people who stay more days the carpet needs a profesional cleaning as well as the windows in rest was clean shower is not very well thought as water goes in all bathroom sometimes to the carpet from room i mention all this as it was more than euros a night i expect more you use tram number to go to central station from which all important destinations start but the distance is long around minutes by tram
