the hotel is located on the floor and the rooms are on the and floors all other floors are apartments getting to the rooms isn t that straight forward but manageable the air conditioning heating system seems a little too complex for some people and i couldn t see any room service options local diner or takeaway menus would be a nice touch for food options for late arrivals
