prior to arrival the whole booking amount several hundred pounds was pre authorised onto my debit card when we were meant to be paying as a group individually upon arrival lots of issues getting it released including a large international phone bill that i am having to pay and a lot of anxiety trying to get this resolved prior to the trip i rated the hotel low for value for money due to the excessive phone charges i incurred as a result of this pre authorisation issue the hotel tried to help when the issue arose but the damage had already been done by their initial actions i would urge them to reconsider their pre authorisation practices only pre authorising a standard deposit or only charging card details if a guest does not turn up as intended
