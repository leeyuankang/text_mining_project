the guy at reception ordered us a taxi to the wrong place and the taxi driver himself was rude and unhelpful even though we showed them both the printed address we paid to be dropped off on the other side of town and had to get a train and another taxi costing to get us to our intended location when we returned to the hotel and explained this to the same guy at reception he was unapologetic and dismissive which i found slightly rude we travelled in a group of and had a triple and a double room the triple room was fine but the double room had a clogged toilet that back filled and flooded the bathroom the stench was unbearable and we didn t sleep for the whole night the next morning the bathroom had dried out and to our horror and disgust the bathroom floor was left with specks of tissue material and faecal matter from the flooded toilet the same guy at the reception was beyond useless he said that there were no more rooms even though we got moved the first thing the next morning by someone else refused to call a plumber and refused to get involved this is extremely appalling and unacceptable service especially for the price we paid the lady at reception was extremely courteous and apologetic but the damage was done there were also no doors for the showers so every time you had a shower the whole bathroom would end up wet which i didn t quite like
