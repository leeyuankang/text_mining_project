we like a full english breakfast which was provided but was cold due to the lid of the server being permanently open everything else about the breakfast was fine other than there being no decaff tea or coffee anywhere on the hotel premises we only had breakfast there on the first day our room was a decent size and was clean and comfortable the bathroom walls were two thirds smoked glass which was a bit odd although it looked cool our room was on the front and there was some traffic noise especially if the balcony doors were opened i would recommend a room at the back as the view was prettier too we were very lucky weather wise but i think it would have been very inconvenient having to commute every day if it had been raining
