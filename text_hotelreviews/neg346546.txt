room decoration is just off when compared to the design of the lobby and cafe very white some swatches of bright colours doesn t need to be bad except that the pure white style extends into the bathroom complete with plastic finishing of the shower area and thin walls this is highly reminiscent of ibis budget except this hotel is supposed to have four stars not one minibar is aggressively refilled meaning staff walks around to replenish it and will knock on your door about it even if you have a dnd sign out saw it happen to other guests in summary not worth the money would not come back
