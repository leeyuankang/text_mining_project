i had made a request for a certain bed configuration x double beds and was assured that this would be on the hotel s computer nobody seemed to know this we could not decrease the temperature in the room which was too hot the room did not have adequate lighting in the main area and was too dark there was only one coffee machine at breakfast with a long queue should be a separate access to hot water it was a longer walk from the central station than anticipated
