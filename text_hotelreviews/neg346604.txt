i had a breakfast box prepared the first morning when i had to leave at for a train to get to my work destination the quality of the packed breakfast was quite poor compared to what was offered at the breakfast buffet they didn t give much chance for choosing on the form that i filled out i suggest improving that form also the loud music in the lobby at most hours is kind of annoying but i am years old and its clear this is a hotel geared towards younger clientele so i guess that it doesn t bother them also i could not hear it from my room the insulation was good the lighting in the room was very very dim even with every single light possible fully lit the hotel is in a nice corner on the ij but is at best a minute walk to any sort of public transportation people should be aware
