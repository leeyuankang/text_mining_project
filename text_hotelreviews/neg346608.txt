really we liked everything as i mentioned in my previous note this hotel is not in the center of downtown but is located good enough to walk from it almost everywhere we had a year old son so sometimes this was a little bit of a problem because he got tired buy in spite of that we recommend it yes they have babysitter available so we had the opportunity to enjoy some of the hight life in ams
