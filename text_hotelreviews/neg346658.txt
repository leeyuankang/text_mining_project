its not the cheapest hotel in the area and while it is very clean and modern i felt that there wasnt any added value for the relatively high price the rooms while clean are basic why not add a coffee machine the breakfast is very expensive euros per person and not included in the rooms price which forced us to eat outside every morning thankfully there are a couple of very nice cafes right in front of the hotel the shower water pressure was also not great at all
