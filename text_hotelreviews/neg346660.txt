some improvements train the housekeeping staff to first look at the do not disturb door hanging sign on the door handles before knocking on guest room doors at am then after around or am enter the unit to do the cleaning i was out of my room for touring the city by am when i returned i saw to my dismay that the bed wasn t made the towels in the bathroom weren t refolded or replaced and the room wasn t tidied up i had to decide whether to tip the housekeeping staff when i left the hotel the next day in the end common decency won out over common sense revise the elevator directory of services and facilities to omit references to a gym on the floor there was no such facility on the property if the property wants people to enjoy the bar at the ij dock facility they need to promote it more just having the bar there on the ij dock is not enough how about a promotion that includes a bar beverage in combination with a tour of one of the docked yachts at the adjacent marina how about a sunset canal or ij river boat cruise that concludes with dinner at the hotel elderly or mobility challenged guests please note that the shower stall in the bathroom does not have safety rails to hold on to and there is a high step from the bathroom floor into the shower and a low step from the shower to the curb then that high step to the bathroom floor i didn t see that step situation and fell on my right hip after taking a shower hotel manager please install safety rails to the shower stalls if you want to avoid lawsuits from disabled guests
