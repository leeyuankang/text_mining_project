we were given a free drink on our arrival which was very nice when we used the voucher the drinks were added to our room at checkout we were advised that the voucher can only be used in the first floor bar not bottom floor bar so we had to then pay we felt that it was pointless offering the free drinks as both bars form part of the hotel and we were not advised of any restriction also one day room service did not come we called and they apologised and said someone would come straight away which was actually hours later
