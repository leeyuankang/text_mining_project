despite of being a clean room the towels are not the most of them got black stains in one occasion all the bath towels had reddish stains what is gross see pictures the plugs shape are concave so not all the adapters are suitable but the reception can let them with no charge the shower screen does not close properly so lets the water out see picture the mini bar is extremley overprice several times a day and even though the don t disturb signal on the clean staff opened the door anyway the stay in this hotel was satisfactory
