the staff was not helpful at checkin at all we were dealing with many pieces of luggage and they never suggested the bellman or even mentioned that as an option we were looking for a luggage cart and didn t find one the hotel doesn t have a parking for checkin and unloading luggage so we had to illegally street park and unload without any help or suggestions from your staff
