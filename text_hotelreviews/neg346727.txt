i had to travel to amsterdam for business nights and decided to extend my stay by two nights to see the city i had made a booking for nights using my credit card upon arrival staff at the reception asked me to pay upfront for my stay i then informed them that i would be paying using different credit cards my business card for the duration of my business visit and my personal credit card for the last two nights of my stay this was the card that i had used to complete the booking on booking com they only took payment for the first nights but failed to inform me that the electronic keys would expire after days when the electronic keys to the room expired i went to the reception and enquired about it i initially interacted with two members of staff who behaved as if i had deceived them i realised that it would take a while for them to sort everything out so i asked them to re issue the keys for my partner to go back to the room while i made the payment they demanded that i pay for the two remaining nights and they would not re activate the keys until the payment had been processed it took them more than minutes to sort everything out when i told them that they already had my card as the booking had been made electronically through booking com they told me that they did not have access to my booking details i then challenged them to explain to me why they did not ask for an upfront payment for the entire duration of my stay they claimed that my card had insufficient funds i was told that they would investigate the incident and get back to me it s been days since i checked out but i have not heard from them yet
