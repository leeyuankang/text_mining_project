on arrival we were told there was no cot for our daughter despite booking one oh but you booked through booking com and it does say subject to availability frankly as a parent that s like saying here s your room but it has no bed it it that would not be acceptable and this is not acceptable in any way if you tell me when i book there is not cot then i go and book somewhere else its that simple a childs safety is paramount and not subject to availability starting our stay this way ruined our experience in this hotel i do not want to start my stay with a fight and then have to think about trying to fond another hotel although it was sorted and no doubt someone else therefore had the same experience later and an apology made it is not acceptable ever and its not the first time this has happened and sadly not the first time we have been made to feel like class citizens for using booking com
