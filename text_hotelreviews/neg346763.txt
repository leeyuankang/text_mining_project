from personal experience i certainly would not recommand that hotel which looks and feels more like a train station hall than a place you could call home for a few days answering to an offer sent by mail i chose to pay to get upgraded when elsewhere this is usually offered on arrival only to be proposed once arrived to pay again for an other better upgrade the room was nice enough facing not the sea nor the city but the industrial zone of a dam why should we pay for that view i wondered long queues are to be expected on checking in or out at any time clueless smileless trainees requiring that you fill up new forms distributed at random what s the use of booking com then some justification being that the system doesn t work in this dark and inhospitable place where breakfast cost euros room service is very invasive someone from room service stepped in my room early one morning without being invited that s a first and every morning up to three cleaning trolleys were parked in the corridor leading to my room and were still there by the middle of the afternoon all in all hospitality standards seem quite low at the aitana and i definitely won t be a roomate again
