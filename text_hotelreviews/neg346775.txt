we arrived in the evening around and i tried to get a cup of coffee this was initially impossible because the coffee machine in the bar was broken and the restaurant had a private function i expressed my surprise that it was apparently impossible for the staff to get us some coffee from the restaurant but i had to take my complaint to management level to get my coffee this should not be necessary in a four star hotel
