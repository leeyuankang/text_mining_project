we arrived early and there was no rooms which was understandable then when we did get in out room wee were then disturbed twice once to check the mini bar then to check if the room had been cleaned also upon checking in we were told that a charge would be against the room and the rest would be charged at the end of the stay then on our day we couldnt get in our room so i went to the reception to then be told our room had been frozen as i had not payed the outstanding balance very annoying
