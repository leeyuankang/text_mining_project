my initial first impressions weren t that great we were welcomed by staff at the front desk and the person went through these check in procedures very quickly with a heavy spanish accent she was telling us that along with the payment for our stay and the tax we also had to put down a euro deposit in case we used facilities no where on the website was this mentioned and she even had the cheek to say we should of read it and have we ever travelled before and insinuated we were irresponsible travellers we ve travelled many times and have never been charged anything prior to using anything we ve had to leave our card details in case we decide to so we can be charged accordingly she went on trying to explain its customary for hotels to charge up to euros as a deposit and if we had travelled previously we would know this i found it to be very rude and the fact that she kept speaking so fast in such a heavy accent it s seemed dismissive in the end she said it s ok we don t have to pay but she will be in trouble made us feel very uncomfortable and unwelcome did not feel like we were valued customers at all even though we were paying close to euros to stay there as well as it was my birthday trip we weren t treated special at all and the hotel staff aren t very personal at all very blunt and the person we dealt with was very passive aggressive our stay was tainted by this initial impression and we didn t feel comfortable using anything at the hotel during our stay here money driven hotel lacks personal touches
