unfortunately i ve had a weird experience of a cleaning lady entering our room at o clock in the morning i told the receptionists about the incident but she told me i was not the first and definately not the last one to experience that in this hotel i was shocked as i travel a lot around the world and things like this do not take place or if they do the hotel management at least tries to apologize and do something about it my morning was disturbed by this situation and therefore i am not satisfied with my stay in this hotel
