can t do anything about the location so bear in mind that its a minutes walk from the central station especially if you need to lug heavy luggage it was ok for us taxi was not happy taking us for such a short distance and demand extra the hotel can do something about the dim lighting in the room lights used are very dim low wattage its difficult to see stuff others may find this ok
