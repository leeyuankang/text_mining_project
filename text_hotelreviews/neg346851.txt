check in was slow and issues with getting my room the bed in the room was blocking access to the minibar the wardrobe and safe which made it hard to move around in room cups smelled of stale water minibar was not cold enough i was charged the wrong city tax on checkout no bathrobes or slippers i had to go back to reception to request these which was honoured seating in room was not so good due to the layout of the room which is like a triangle and bed occupies most of the middle of the room
