i think the doubletree is an overall better deal better service and a slightly better location my room was an executive room however the space was limited due the shape of the ceiling the chair looked good very modern but totally uncomfortable and therefore useless i travel with apple tv especially in foreign countries and can not understand why they disable the hdmi options on the tv the aitana does not provide vod movies which is fine but the tv programming is pretty boring on a very stormy and rainy day
