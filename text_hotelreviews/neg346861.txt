generally the hotel is overrated for me when we arrived our room wasn t ready even though we had booked it two months ago and we had to wait until or stay for the night in another room obviously inferior to ours and then go to ours without a discount or something similar for the inconvenience the room was nice but overpriced i ve stayed in much better hotels with the same price
