just a comment about shuttle to airport that is not a service of the hotel but they can reserve with a company named connexxion this shuttle service is not a deal for more than one person for two costs almost the same price as a taxi and a lot more time of travel we almost lose our flight since the shuttle stops in at least two other hotels to pick up people and the driver simply waits and waits until people decides to go into the shuttle affecting others but the aitana is really excellent
