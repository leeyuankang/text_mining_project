eeven though i booked in advance when we arrived they only had a room for the disabled meaning the bathroom was stripped of many things they offered to upgrade my room if i would pay extra i find that incredibly in poor judgement they should have given me a better suited room without extra charge the prices are incredibly high in this hotel
