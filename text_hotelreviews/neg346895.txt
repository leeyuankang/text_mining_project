hotel and booking com informed me about absence of parking places in public parking garage nearby only when it was already not possible to cancel reservation hours even more disappointing was the fact that personnel in the garage explained me that aitana management didn t reserve parking places for its visitors upfront even thou parking offered to do it this is for me sign of lack of customer care second disappointment is beautiful view of amsterdam even from top flor all you will see is gray block of buildings other side of the street train line and some other elements of city landscape that with all imagination i can t advice to anyone as something valuable to see just a waist of money
