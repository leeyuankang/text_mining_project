on occasions our breakfast didn t arrive so i had to call the reception once the breakfast card guests fill in to order what they want in the morning was not collected when the time slot had passed within which i ordered my breakfast i looked outside and my breakfast card was still hanging outside next day same issue although this time my card was collected but no food so a little setback on the break fast side of things annoying because we had our day planned and it set us back a little with our time but as mentioned the staff where all great and we left this hotel with a smile
