i don t mind keeping my towels for a three night stay and appreciate that the hotel puts up signs and asks to keep towels to reduce the impact of cleaning on the environment but at the rembrandt the signs are there and then still the towels are changed everyday the cleaning staff had no idea and said we always change every day
