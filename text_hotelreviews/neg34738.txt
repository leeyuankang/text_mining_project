an item promised to us by night staff at reception for collection the next morning was not ready and had not been handed over to morning shift which created a delay to our schedule however morning shift did manage to solve the problem also had some language problems with restaurant staff in explaining what we required snacks in minibar would have been nice and perhaps a bit more info as to how the free mobile offer worked
