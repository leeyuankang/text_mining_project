parking wasn t the easiest we couldn t find it initially so temporarily parked up to speak with a receptionist luckily there were two of us i e one to speak to staff and the other to stay in the car otherwise it would have been more of a mission the staff member then called a guy who took our car brand and colour the man then let us through the barrier of a private road and led us to the secure car park it costs per night so not the cheapest if you are driving as they only took cash i spent another mins getting cash out not a difficult process but i m used to easier i e underground parking
