reception staff were indifferent left bags while i parked the car in the subsidised nearby multi story came back and they were still in a heap in reception they should have taken them up to the room standard hotel service forgot to take a swipe of my credit card which meant that every bar purchase had to be made in cash or separate card transaction annoying the restaurant was never mentioned to us and was mostly kept in darkness a taxi ride to the nearest tube and the nearby train station was a fairly long journey into town we stayed more nights in london but at a more central hotel not a hilton doubletree based on this experience
