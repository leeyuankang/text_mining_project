when we arrived at the hotel it looked lovely but when we went into our room it was like it had been abandoned very dusty even after complaing the staff did offer to clean it straight away but it was late for us so we asked them to clean it for the following morning after coming back from our time out it still seemed the same we also noticed that the duvet was not changed as it had a tear in it we did not complain as we thought it would get done the following morning but no it was the same one which makes me wonder weather it had be changed from the previous customers we were very disappointed in this expected a little better room service just wanted it to be a little cleaner
