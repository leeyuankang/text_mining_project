the management and staff of this hotel is horrible and that s the reason i can t recommend staying here first housekeeping left us without tissue and very little toilet paper and no spare on the first day we got in late and didn t really realize it until the next morning when we ran out that morning i called housekeeping and they said they don t come to the rooms until later and to call reception so i called reception and they asked if we could wait for two hours what a stupid and ridiculous question when a hotel guest says they have no tissue or toilet paper i said no and i guess to their credit someone brought it second the brochure in the room talks about a breakfast to go option which i asked about at the front desk since we had a tour that left before they started serving breakfast the person at the front desk didn t know what i was talking about despite the brochure so connected me to a food service person she told me i could order for the next day and pick the delivery time and it would be brought to our room i did so however the breakfast never arrived i called to inquire and the room service food services person told me that you cannot order via the phone and have to fill out a card and leave it on the door and that they had no record of our order anyway again just great customer service third our tour operator had called the concierge to say that they would be running late and the concierge never relayed the message the bottom line is that the management and staff at this hotel is inept and useless this all happened in a four day time span i ve never had an experience like this at any other hotel i ve stayed at
