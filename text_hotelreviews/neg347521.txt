bar closed early during our stay there was a problem with the door room number as it did not lock and as you pushed it it would open which meant no security during our stay this only came to light the last day as we were leaving i did report it to front desk but they did not seem to be too concern would i use hilton hotels again remains to be seen as no offer of explanation was made to rectify my concern
