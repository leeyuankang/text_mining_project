bedroom could be looked into from adjacent flats expressed concern to staff and was told to close the curtains i did suggest that the room could do with a blind or nets as there was also a mirror placed quite close to the window which i m sure gave the neighbours an excellent view of the bed also quite a few cobwebs on the ceiling booked a queen size room anticipating a queen size bed however this was not the case did not have breakfast in the hotel as prices were extortonet i think it was something like for full english and for continental madness
