first night we couldn t shut the window and as we were on the front by the roundabout it did get noisy and didn t sleep too good first night this was rectified following morning but it was closed and bolted so unable to open window if we wanted to thankfully there was air conditioning as it was in london those few days we were there staff were very helpful though with regards to this matter
