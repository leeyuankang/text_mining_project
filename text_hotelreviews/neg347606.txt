we were only staying nights but had to move rooms for the second night for planned maintenance on the first room my daughter was attending an interview and having to pack up our things before we could go despite the second room not being ready for us made the situation more stressful not impressed if the room was ok for the first night why not the second our two night stay was booked well in advance and should have been accommodated more efficiently
