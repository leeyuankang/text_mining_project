following on from my comments on previous stays the breakfast buffet food should be updated and it s the one thing that let s you down as with other chain hotels buffet hot food very similar to mcdonalds but perhaps that is to satisfy demand would prefer an option of upmarket quality sausages eggs meats cheese bread etc maybe on the a la carte if you don t want need the whole cereal buffet thing bearing in mind the hotel is based in chelsea opposite the design centre and there are very few options for cooked breakfast in the immediate area i checked there is a missed opportunity here for in coming trade from local residents and visiting interior designers as well as hotel guests it would give the hotel a certain flagship feel to the double tree brand and would fit with the laura ashley styling on the floor
