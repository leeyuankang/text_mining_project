breakfast buffet had a lot og choices but the quality of the food was very low would prefere less options and a lot higher quality i personally did not est much because of the low food quality the first morning we arrived me and my child at to the breakfast breakfast was officially until and was denied access to the breakfastroom that seemed like a rather absurd situation principle and gave us a quite bad first impression our tiny delay was because our room had no more bags for the drycleaning so i had been waiting a little while in reception to deliever my close there instead the people at the restaurant could generally learn a lot from the kindness of the people in the reception to different mindsets at the same hotel
