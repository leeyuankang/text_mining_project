breakfast was a bit chaotic with some food not being replaced quick enough in the buffet so some dishes were not available all of the time which annoyed me pleased with the room upgrade but disappointed the hotel couldn t make the gesture of giving us the bottle of wine free which i had asked to be in our room on arrival for our special occasion
