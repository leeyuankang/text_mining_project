our room smelled of sewer whenever we tried to turn on the fan or a c since it was very hot compared to where we had come from this was pretty terrible we finally figured out how to open and lock the windows we were in a basement room with ground level access so did not want to leave them accessible when we called about the smell they said they would check into it but nothing seemed to change so we just turned off the system
