with deep regret i must report we had a pair of jeans stolen or accidentally went missing from our room the hotel policy states it does not take responsibility of items that go missing from the room the only explanation offered was we must have left the door open we know this not to be true or to be so careless insult to injury really a four star hotel should guarantee safety and security to go along with the glossy attractive brochure and friendly accommodating staff we have been overpowered uncompensated and now out of pocket disgusted and disheartened not an ideal situation to end a great week in amsterdam we do not recommend this hotel
