the only thing we found bad was that there were hairs in the bath having said this we did put the hotel under pressure by arriving early it was unusual to have the sink in the bedroom hallway area beside the entrance door as this meant there was no bathroom mirror or sink anyone who would like a bit of privacy from their travel companion while having the use of a sink would be inconvenienced the bath was perfect but when using the shower the water went through the screen and flooded the bathroom these are minor details but i imagine some would be disappointed paying a higher price during the high season and receiving facilities that you know are a smudge under what the hotel is truly capable
