there were no drawers if you have folded clothes to store away there is no space to store them we literally had to live out of the suitcase there was only a small area for hanging clothes the room was pretty small for a couple with a year old the double bed was large very nice but then with the sofa bed right next to it was quite tight leaving little space to work with and without closet space and all the suitcases and stuff on the floor it was unpleasant insulation between rooms was very poor the tv next door was on the wall facing our room and you could pretty much hear everything and with neighbours watching tv late at night we had to sleep with ear plugs i found it odd with a door to the next room even though it was locked
