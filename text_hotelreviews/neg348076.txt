the street was under construction so it was difficult to get in and out of the hotel we paid for an executive room and paid extra for breakfast up front prior to traveling we confirmed that the room was paid when we checked in however in checking out there was an additional charge for the room the explanation was that the weekend rate was higher and we owed an extra euro because we were there one day on the weekend they refused to honor our confirmed paid rate
