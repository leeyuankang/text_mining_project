the oddest thing about this wonderful hotel is that all three nights we were there i needed to call down and ask for clean coffee cups and supplies not sure why providing clean coffee cups when they provide both a mini expresso maker and hot water kettle isn t part of the usual housecleaning protocol but this little annoyance wouldn t stop me from staying there again
