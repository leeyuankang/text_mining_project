the hotel was very difficult to find due to its address being so similar to other addresses in the area i recommend looking carefully on a map for its location before venturing there google maps wasn t working for us that day so we were out of luck we called and the front desk people with strong eastern european accents could not sufficiently explain how to get there very frustrating start to our stay also the concierge gave us misinformation about the presence of reduced price theater ticket booths told us they don t exist in london and they do and sold us full price theater tickets also he gave us serious misinformation about the length of a taxi ride to the theater said minutes and in minutes we still hadn t made it had to get out of the taxi and literally run to the theater we were very upset with the concierge
