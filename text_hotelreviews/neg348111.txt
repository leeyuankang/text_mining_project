unfortunately when i put the jacuzzi bath on black dirt spurted out of the holes which was a bit off putting also the double bed was two singles pushed together which was a bit disappointing as i had booked a double room expecting a proper double bed and fell down the crack a bit during the night however it was very comfortable non the less
