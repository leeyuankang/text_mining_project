the only thing i would say is the hotel restaurant menu didn t really interest us much not much on there to shout home about but to be honest with you the hotel is in such a great location for some really good breakfast spots that its not worth eating at the hotel anyway so i wouldn t bother getting breakfast but i must stress this is personal preference not a negative at all
