reception staff were generally very helpful we left a case before and after our one night stay however when we arrived for check in at about there was a short delay and cleaning staff were clearly only just finishing their day s work unfortunately we were given keys and the number written on the key card was for an already occupied room we couldn t gain access of course but it was embarrasssing and a further delay
