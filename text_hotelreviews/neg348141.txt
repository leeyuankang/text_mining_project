we were given a room in the cellar or as it was called this meant basically no day light the narrow window facing a back yard was not properly sealed so quite a draught also we were first given a double douvet and unfortunately also a double bed however we managed to get an extra douvet and the bed was large enough for two friends because we only stayed nights we let this pass charging your credit card for night plus eur is rather heavy too but the reserveration was gone when i returned home
