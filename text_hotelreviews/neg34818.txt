there was a fee to use the gym and pool which should be included in the very expensive room rate the housekeeping staff took one of my socks that i d washed and had hanging to dry one sock is pretty useless no compensation was offered on the same day within an hour three staff members entered our room without waiting for us to answer their knock at the door this was unacceptable especially the one who had no reason at all to be there
