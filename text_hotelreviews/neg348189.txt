when we arrived we were told that we were being given an upgrade and shown to the basement near the lift we enquired about another room with at least a window to the street we were then told that was the room we booked i reminded the receptionist that i did not want their upgrade but would like the room i had booked is it because we are from australia and we have a relaxed attitude that we are actually given worse rooms hotel operators must realise that hours on a plane to get to their hotel requires some reverence and not some one to be taken advantage of this has happen a few times even when booking very expensive rooms to jl s credit we were moved immediately admittedly a smaller room on the floor but at least our window opened to the street
