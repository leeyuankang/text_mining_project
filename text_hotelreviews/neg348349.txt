we also rented a room for our daughter it was a night it was smaller than her dorm room at college i would not have rented that room for her if i had seen a photo that truly reflected the size of the room the hotel must use a fish eye lense to make the room look a lot bigger than it really is lots of steps in the hotel someone who is handicapped would not be able to go to breakfast it would have to be served in the bar area or brought to their room the treads for the steps are shallow which is a problem too the bathtub shower was difficult to get in and out of the side of the tub is very high the makeup mirror is so high on the wall only a tall person could use it we were charged for breakfast booking com said it would be euro which is about right now
