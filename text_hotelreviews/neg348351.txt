while not facing a busy street our room on the third floor was very noisy the single window glazing offered no protection whatsoever making it difficult to find sleep during the night the same was true for noise from inside the hotel we heard every door clapping room maids moving around in the floor etc it was as if it was all happening next to our bed that was very different to modern hotels and for me personally will be the reason to not book this hotel again as lovely the house and interior is a room change while initially envisaged for half way during our stay was not feasible in the end
