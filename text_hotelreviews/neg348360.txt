don t think the hotel is worth nearly per night staff are friendly and hotel is clean location is ok about half an hour or so walk into the centre of amsterdam would suggest that the hotel invests in some rubber bath mats for the bathrooms shower over bath i had a nasty fall during my stay resulting in a bad gash on my knee and multiple bruises never really thought about reporting it at the time the shower over the bath is quite a neat set up would prove very difficult and uncomfortable for a larger person overall amsterdam is brilliant and i will definitely be planning another journey in the future perhaps to a different hotel maybe safer
