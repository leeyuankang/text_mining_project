the total stay had been more negative then positive first the toilette had some brown dirt directly on the seat which we had to clean ourselves because we needed to go on the toilette after complaining at the reception we only got offered a different room which wouldnt make sense as we already cleaned up further the room had been very noisy whole night some kind of blubbering sound was to hear incl something sounded like a motor wont recommend the hotel as eur per night is much to expensive for this uncomfortable stay
