my single room was quite cramped with barely space for the desk and chair so no armchair or anywhere comfy to sit except the bed my bathroom had a fairly confined wetroom style shower which although powerful was not very convenient given that public transport in amsterdam is so good i think you could save money by finding somewhere a bit further out with more space
