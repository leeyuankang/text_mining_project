some staff were unsure over booking trips etc booked a cruise but only paid small amount and still had to pay at kiosk for the trip a lot of exposed heating pipework within the room is this typical to amsterdam or just dated plumbing the road and pavements were being replaced on the whole street access was ok but not ideal i accept the hotel can t do anything but prior notice or a few words on arrival would have been courteous
