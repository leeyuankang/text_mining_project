we paid eur city tax for a night in this hotel and we ve got a tight room with a small window about centimetres and even this window was at m high since we knew that we were gonna get there quite early we asked for the check in between i don t think that this could not have been arranged with just a minor effort of organization the first room left by any other guest in the morning should have been cleaned at first but they couldn t make it we had to wait up to when we ve got this hole
