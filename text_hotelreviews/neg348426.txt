room size we had room a standard twin i doubt the room was more than metres square excluding the bathroom it was simply too small to be comfortable in there was a tiny wardrobe with hangars and two small shelves to put your clothes on this is inadequate the recently renovated bathroom was very attractive with hi tech equipment but as there was no water pressure it was pretty near useless i spoke to a receptionist at a nearby hotel and apparently these tiny rooms are the norm in the museum quarter next time i will spend more and get a room that is comfortable or try another area out of the tourist hotspot
