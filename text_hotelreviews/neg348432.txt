nothing i didn t like but here s a couple of tips my room on the floor required me to climb a few steps not an issue for me with small luggage but something to look out for also lift door is manual so unless you open the door when the lift stops it will move to wherever it s been called with you still in it i took the stairs a couple of times but note that they re pretty steep
