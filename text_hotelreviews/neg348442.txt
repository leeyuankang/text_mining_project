the breakfast was overpriced and the selection was only basic the room we stayed in was very small and stuffy similarly the bathroom was small and got very hot from the shower the room was very dusty and the sink wasn t cleaned well parking nearby is expensive and not secure so do not drive generally an expensive stay for an average hotel
