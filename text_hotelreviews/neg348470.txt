there were one or two things that were a disappointment the drains in the bathroom sinks did not function well and smelled rather unpleasant staff responded quickly to our concerns but the problem did not completely go away we asked for a wake up call on our final morning and for the first time ever in all of our travels we did not receive one we were late for our taxi to the airport and it added unnecessary stress to our travels that day
