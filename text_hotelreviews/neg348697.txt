i was forced to pay for a breakfast more than i had due to booking made on vouchers paid by different creditcards the breakfast was paid on one voucher but could only be used that day not the next this is not a hotel with any etics or it is very poorly managed or mayby in financial trouble since they must trick their guests like this they get their money for booking com but it is lost for the guest because it was on the wrong voucher don t book in this hotel
