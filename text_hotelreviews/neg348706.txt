it look mins to check in cause the guy at desk was barely moving and picked his nose while checking us in the room was meant to be singles but we got a double and were told we had no choice but we had booked singles the room was really dated and just unkept the bed was just disgusting and smelly the room had no air con and no tv signal overall a terrible hotel and should be removed from booking com
