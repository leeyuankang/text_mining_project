everything but more specifically the room smelled horrible when we arrived it was a hot day and after failing to figure out how to turn on the air conditioning which is promised as an amenity we asked the staff to help us they were very rude and told us there could be no air conditioning until next month we tried to make the room comfortable by opening the window but it was still very hot and the sounds of the city were obnoxious this hotel should not be listed as a place to do business with on booking com or any other site
