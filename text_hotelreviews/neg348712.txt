worst hotel experience i had first of all the room was filthy dirty floor ugly smell and never cleaned under the matress i work as a hotel manager and i know where to look to bad for them very poor customer service with untrained staff i was double charged for the stay so i had to deal with booking com to get my money back they even told that i was lying but luckly i kept the receipt anyway very inconfortable stay pillows felt like rocks the bedding was damp and probably from previous stay for the price i paid of euro you wouldn expect much but the staff was so rude and i never get an apology for the double charge n my opinion booking com should stop making bussinnes with this hotel
