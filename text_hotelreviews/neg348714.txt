the hotel was under construction the room we got was in the floor while the floor was closed and right beneath our room s window there was drilling knocking and generally a lot of noise during early morning hours up until pm so we couldn t take a nap from time to time when we needed it i have to add that when i ordered the room from booking they didn t mention that the hotel was under construction when i asked the receptionist what can be done about it he said i m sorry but i have nothing to do it will last for more days of course the construction works didn t end but continued all week also i wouldn t recommend taking a room with a double bed since it was a back breaking experience
