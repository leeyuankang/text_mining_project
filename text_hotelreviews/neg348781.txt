on the original booking they advertised that as it was a luxury suite we would be provided with bathrobes slippers unfortunately these were not provided despite having mentioned it to the staff who said they would attend to it we also mentioned it to the reception on checkout we did get an apology but as we were charged for the luxury suite i felt that they could have offered a discount
