the wifi wasn t working and the staff member at the reception desk was not willing to help rectify this there is a sign in the lift that says reception is at but no button is in the lift the beds were uncomfortable and low and there was rust in the bath and above on the ceilings finally the time i rang down about the safe the staff member hung up i found staff did not want to speak english or make an effort with foreign travellers which seems unusual for a popular city destination comes across rude and unpleasant
