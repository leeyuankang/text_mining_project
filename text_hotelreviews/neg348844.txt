when we booked the room we asked for a double bed and when we arrived we were told that all the rooms had twin beds only more expensive rooms had double beds if that had been more clear from the beginning we probably wouldn t have booked that room or that hotel it was a misunderstanding on the website we shouldn t have been offered the choice between double and twin if they only had twin the rooms are not incredibly modern but they are clean and functional
