while we assumed breakfast would be a buffet we hadn t realised that we wouldn t be able to sit down when we went to the restaurant so had to wait for a table in the lounge this would have been ok if we d known in advance but as it was the minute wait for a table meant a brief and very rushed breakfast as we had to checkout and get across the city to marylebone to catch a train had we known in advance we could have timed our morning better as it was the rush spoilt our breakfast in fact we left before we d finished and being anxious about catching the train the only one we could catch to meet a later engagement that day made it all a bit stressful better advance communication with guests on this would help
