we arrived early before checkin time the hotel was notified before they offered us an early checkin for additional charge that we paid immediately but we found out the room is a single occupancy one the bed was too small for two we notified them and they said our room is not going to be ready and we either accept this smaller one downgrade or upgrade for another charge for the duration of our stay we asked for what we paid for they kept saying it s not available due to new year time frustratingly i went online and found the same room type available and offered to guests eventually we accepted the paid upgrade and paid the additional daily charge our reservation was inclusive of breakfast during the paid early checkin they said we can t use the breakfast on that day as breakfast starts from the next day we weren t even thinking about it but we found it very wearied during checkout we asked for help to carry the luggage and nobody came without even a simple apology the receptionists were mostly unfriendly
