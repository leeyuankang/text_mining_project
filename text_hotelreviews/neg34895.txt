we stayed here for nights dec to celebrate my wife s birthday we chose this hotel as we had stayed here before for the exact same dates two years ago and had a very enjoyable time this time was very different our booking from booking com shows we had booked a superior room but this is not what we were given the room was so small that the double bed had to be sited against the wall which meant that i had to climb over my wife for the usual nocturnal visit to the bathroom also i couldn t have a glass of water at the bedside and obviously the was no reading light my side not ideal for a couple in their sixties we were informed that the hotel was full so no other rooms were available we were here however to enjoy ourselves and decided to get on with it but this is not what you expect from a star hotel when we checked out i asked how many such rooms the hotel had and was informed by the check out lady that they had only a few and these were normally reserved for single occupancy but when the hotel is full they were given to couples i then asked why we were chosen for such a room as we had booked and paid for a superior room on october at this point she became very coy and stated that someone had to have it i again i asked why us but she just repeated someone had to have it i got the impression that because we had booked via booking com and had probably paid less that some other guests we were fobbed off with a room that you could not call standard never mind superior i ask for some kind of recompense from booking com as the room was not what was described i have been a good customer and booked many stays with them and this experience leaves a bad taste jess ashman
