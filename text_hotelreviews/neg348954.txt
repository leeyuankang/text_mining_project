we requested room not to be cleaned as per invite in our room as stayed for nights as this is good for environment we agreed to this received a voucher for euros as reward for this but this had to be spent in hotel bar due to a problem with trains on day of departure we arrived back at hotel later than planned and asked to buy a bottle of water to take on journey to ferry were advised could only purchase a glass bottle at bar for euros which could not be taken from bar i asked if i could spend voucher in hotel shop and buy a plastic bottle but was refused very unreasonable as i explained our circumstances to staff and still was refused it s a shame as room and hotel were both great and staff very helpful until this point
