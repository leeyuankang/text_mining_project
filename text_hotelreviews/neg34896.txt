the hotel concentrates on a full english breakfast which is superb and constantly kept fresh however the alternatives are quite poor just cottage cheese and pre packed babybell with a smoked cheese item which is impossible to get into without a scalpel is not what you expect from a classy hotel no smoked salmon no water melon no grapes no fresh fruit salad no omelette eggs benedict or eggs florentine offered and only plastic pre packed ham and salami for cold meats provided you like english breakfast you are ok if you are looking for something else you may be a little disappointed
