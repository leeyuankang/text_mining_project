i called down to reception on the first night to see if they were still doing food i was told i could get pizza from the bar for and this was available any time when i went downstairs to get this i was then told i would have to use a takeaway as the oven has been turned off i pointed out i was told it was available any time to which the guy agreed to make me a pizza which took minutes to cook by which time i was falling asleep the ironing board had some mysterious pink marks on it which ended up being ironed onto one of my white shirts the clear plastic chair had some very mysterious stains on it and bits of cannabis and tobacco thus it hadn t been cleaned on the second night of the stay i used the restaurant i arrived at and waited around minutes to even have my order taken it was taken and i waited patiently for my food the food was ok but when i asked for a pudding i was told the kitchen is closed never before have i been refused a pudding during a meal i am already sat down to and having already been served a main i took this as being very rude and very unheard of in my opinion i believed it was courtesy to finish offering the service to those who are seated within the time frame i also had a privilege room which seemed a bit small in my opinion when the location is taken into account i feel it is overpriced for what i received i needed to be close to amsterdam rai however we were about mile away which was good but it was very far out from everything else
