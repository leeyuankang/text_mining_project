on the last day of our stay we have realised there is a bicycle and scooter rental at the hotel also we didn t know there is a ferry from hotel to city centre quite possibly it was just our oversight but possibly this could be advertised better this leaves us no other option then book our next stay with you in nearest future so that we can cycle around beautiful amsterdam and also take a ferry to city centre
