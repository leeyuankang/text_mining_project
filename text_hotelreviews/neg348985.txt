bar staff were quite rude to my partner he s diabetic and asked for some water one of the male staff looked in my partners bag as he opened it and saw cordial in there then accused him of making his own drinks first of all he shouldn t be looking in other peoples belongings secondly it was our last day so yeah we had been shopping and got a few things thirdly what happened to innocent until proven guilty my partner did nothing wrong and made to feel like a common criminal he explained his condition to the member of staff but he just walked off very childish and unprofessional i think the male member of staff needs to find a new profession because he clearly doesn t know how to deal with the public or complaints
