the ac did not work the first night which meant a sweaty evening this problem was fixed by cleaning the system and resetting the cooling level and providing a fan after the first sweaty night we asked for the sheets to be changed but that didn t happen on the day there ultimately they were changed the staff responded well but we had to be persistent overall the staff did a great job we had two rooms for two couples and both ac systems had to be fixed
