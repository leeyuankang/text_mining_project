check in very slow and i personally didn t like the islands rather than a desk where staff met us although room was great it wasn t what we needed and we couldn t give up the upgrade for our original room as it was been given to someone else and hotel was full bus shuttle to train station only runs for hour in the morning and only boat taxis in the morning no way to return by boat i felt that this was misrepresented in hotel information
