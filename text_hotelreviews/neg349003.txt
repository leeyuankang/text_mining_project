booked a double bed but was given a twin room hotel were fully booked during our stay so it didn t seem worth complaining was too tired but beware room was generally clean but the carpet was clearly very old heavy worn and needed to be replaced some years ago similarly the window did not close properly some road noise and the air conditioning was largely ineffective
