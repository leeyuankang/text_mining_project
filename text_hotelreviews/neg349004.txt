the welcome greeting was somehow strange there was a women at the entrance who first of all asked you all kind of stuff before you could get to the check in counter i had the feeling i was checking in a military bootcamp because of her way she approached and asked after that we did a pre check in we were told the room will be ready at early check in was not possible later when we retourned we got the keycards only problem was that they werent working so we had to get down again they rewrote the keycards and we tried again we could now open the room but there was already luggage in the room and it was only bed room instead of beds which we booked so we had to get down once again to the reception after that we were told that there was a mixup with the room after that everything worked out and we finally got our right room
