but for the price i expected more the gymarea was tiny the sauna was just average paying more than euros per night room should be enough to get more value even for amsterdam also i missed the employees telling you about the hotel and the facilities where to find them working hours to be honest i wouldn t recomend the hotel if you could get one with similar equipment for a similar price
