stayed for four nights but never took breakfast as felt it was overly expensive at euros per person little disappointed with the bar staff not particularly friendly or helpful when we booked our travel tickets we left an open credit card in case we booked anything further which we ultimately did not upon departure we were told our tickets would be processed and that would be that however on checking my bank statement the hotel had billed me for our stay despite the fact i had paid everything in advance i phoned the hotel who confirmed they had made a mistake and the money would be refunded within a few days five days later i am still waiting
