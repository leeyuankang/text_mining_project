part of staff was not polite we had to wait long for the service at the bar or at the internal shop the hotel rooms were too old and no worth the money for what they offered no facility offered by the hotel to get to the city centre or at the airport just one bus shuttle that would get people to the closest metro station only once at the towels were not white at all the hairdryer was too much used etc
