the rooms werent ready on arrival which was a little inconvenient to us then our rooms were not together not even in the same tower block you had to return to the lobby then get a different lift to their room we didn t like having to drink out of paper cups that were provided in the room ours was a triple room and my parents had a double on comparison their room was modern and better equipped than our triple room and we didn t like to look at the empty drink bottles that someone had left outside the lift area near our room these should have been moved sometime over our night stay
