mattress was only adequate but worst thing was the sound proofing to the next rooms the guy one one side of me had toilet oriented issues and on the other seemed to have to talk to siri very slowly loudly to learn about london and also at one point some tourists were loud in the hall it all sounded like it was in my room like many london hotels this one seems to be composed of different buildings so maybe one of the other ones has quiet rooms but then why did they ignore my request for one i did get put in the back so there was little street or hall noise so they didn t totally ignore it but then i m surprised i m the first to complain about noise here
