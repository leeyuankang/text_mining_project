the location was a bit far but the minutes walking to the nearest metro as advertise is accurate took us longer on arrival as we had a lot luggage to drag from that station but it wasn t too bad for room temperature control somehow only the heater can be turned on at nights and air cond during the day not sure whether this is common to all hotels in this country one night it was a bit too hot thought we could turn on the air conditioning but only heat came out opened the windows instead until morning
