price of breakfast is very high at per person during weekdays the location of the hotel is also quite far from central station i would have preferred a hotel closer to the main part of the city a day ticket for the metro is so it can get quite expensive if you re staying for a longer period there is also nothing in the area of the hotel so travelling out of the area is a must in order to eat or purchase snacks the ones in the hotel shop are very limited and the restaurant menu is quite pricey and also limited
