stayed in a privilege room on the floor which was a box very cramped hate to know what the standard room was like because the upgrade is definitely not worth the money which they advised is usually an extra a night they also advised there would be extras on the room for all of the inconvenience caused during booking when confronted about this as there was nothing in or on the room they gave us a pack of waffles won t be booking again
