room was basic and a bit out of date the room had one small window towards the end of the room which was a bit disappointing generally mist of the rooms have small windows in this hotel location is min away from the city centre however train station is not that far within min walking distance don t forget to ask the staff about the time table of the train because you may ended up waiting for half an hour in the cold weather
