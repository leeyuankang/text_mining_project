this hotel is not star classic rooms are extremely shabby cigarete burns in carpet faded and chipped furniture towels are thin threadbare and had holes in them told us this is because the room is due for renovation no cups or milk in room insufficient tea and coffee location is terrible in an industrial area mins by train out of the city nothing is in walking distance no cafes or shops close by on checkin they tried to charge us for city taxes even though we had prepaid these on booking tried to get us to pay an extra per night for their renovated rooms on check in a stay closer in town is better value for money than this poorly located shabby star hotel so dissapointing
