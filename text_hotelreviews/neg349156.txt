the fridge was disgusting mouldy inside left a horrible smell in the room for hours after we told one of the reception staff we went to use and was told it ll be sorted and were sorry for this when we went to use the fridge later on assuming it would be clean the fridge was full of mould still health and safety at its finest here we didn t even get anything for this poor effort in house keeping like fruit bottle of wine or anything else was really disappointed as the hotel was really nice otherwise also we had the offer of buying breakfast on site but this was very expensive per person
