even though we booked a superior double room it was extremely small with very little space to move around and no case storage also breakfast did not start until and as i had to be out by i had to forgo my booked full english breakfast a sin in my eyes as it was already included in the deal and could only have a room service inadequate breakfast my wife did enjoy her breakfast though
