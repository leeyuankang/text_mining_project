nobody changed our towels or made our bed we had to request this and still no housekeeper made the bed just placed some towels in room and didn t take the old ones complete laziness there was no iron or bath robes like the pictures suggested there would be so i was quite disappointed one member of staff who checked us in was quite rude but two other members were very friendly and helpful a member of staff knocked on our door at on the day we checked out which i found rude considering they hadn t cleaned the room the day prior but wanted us out earlier to clean for the next guests
