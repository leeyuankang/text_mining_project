no communication they got my booking all wrong until i challenged them they took the money from my bank within a week of booking when i was told i was to pay in the day when j asked them about it i got no response they also told us we had been upgraded to business class i think it was a lie as they d over booked probably hence the complication in booking the room was nice but very small no way it was an upgrade
