hard to say i do not want to complain here as our stay was great and room was clean every day if you really want to ask me what i will change i have a general comment for all carpet hotels i will change the carpet in rooms it is much more clean to have wooden floor or something which is not carpet like as i assume that you are not cleaning it every month nothing special happened to ours but just as generic comment
