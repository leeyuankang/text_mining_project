absolutely dirty windows everywhere in the room in the coridors in a double room only small shampoo and even this small pack was never renewed until it is finished no slippers which is absolutely unacceptable when we asked on the reception the stuff member at first promised to bring us slippers but then after half a day of not doing it we asked again and got an answer that for our room it is not provided which sounds very weird because slippers is so very basic hygienic thing very poor working lift with the system when you have to activate it with the key from the room
