the last night we had a charge of deducted from our account and after speaking to the staff on check out we were told this was for breakfast despite not eating any apparently this is what their system does it ll deduct the money and refund you in three days i was not happy with this and had it refunded that day apparently you have to request it be taken off of your room to not be charged
