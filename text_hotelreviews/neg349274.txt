the room were were supposed to get was not the room we got on arrival which was very dissapointing why would you put a picture of a room that you are staying in and then on arrival get a completely different room very unprofessional the food menu was the same everyday which was questionable to wonder if it was fresh would of thought for such a nice hotel might have different choice of food menu everyday also the tv did not work in our room but didn t bother us much
