the room given to us was not similar to the shown on booking com for standard room type the look and feel of the hotel was below the image given on booking com or their internet site additionally the walk to the nearest metro station is too long it s not mins as said or mins when walked quickly being dependent on a train and then on subway to reach the city centre was not very convenient for us aswe had to purchase two separate types of tickets also on bookking com they say that the hotel offers a boat transfer to the city centre but this turned out to be having a stop in front of the hotel for the city cruise line which you can benefit with a paid ticket but the word offer indicates that it is on the house this was a a big disappointment to us
