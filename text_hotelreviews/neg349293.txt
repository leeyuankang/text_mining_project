the neighbourhood si pretty empty i had no other options than having lunch at the hotel restaurant towels were thin and seemed very old shower box was big and had showers the bigger and coolest one though had the problem that would make the water leak from the glass door flooding the bathroom highway very close so still a bit noisy even with windows shut
