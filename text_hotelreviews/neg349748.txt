there is a kindergarten across the street and it tends to get pretty loud no air conditioning is annoying in the hot summer days i was the most disappointed by the breakfast i ve especially chosen the hotel for the great breakfast but then i saw the shabby swedish buffet you could choose from scraping some scrambled eggs off the recipient a few slices of cold cuts and cheese there were also a few yogurts and cereal if you are into that
