even though we knew this as we ve stayed before it is about time evening meals snacks were offered there are a few restaurants a distance away but as we had a large van we couldn t really access them as we were working in the city until late each day staff will order in a take away for you but only pizza menus seem to exist pizza three nights running after working hours was a bit too much for us this time perhaps a wider choice of takeaway menu would be possible or of course evening meals snacks could be available from the downstairs breakfast area think you re missing the opportunity to up sell here guys as i say we did know this beforehand but would now think twice about re booking continental breakfast too did seem a little more measured from our last visit months before everything else at the hotel is great clean rooms great staff and very quite location
