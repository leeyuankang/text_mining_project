this was a last minute booking suggested by booking com as my original booking at kadima apartments was cancelled by them on the day of my flight i was assured it was no further from my conference than the apartments but it was on the outskirts of vienna close to vineyards and there were no pubs or restaurants in walking distance the trip to the conference involved a bus and then two tram rides walking distance haha i was assured there was wifi but it did not work in the room and was deadly slow in the lobby the bed was a waterbed just what you want after hours of travelling the shower lacked power the extractor fan was noisy i had to drag my luggage up the stairs i made a formal complaint to booking com and using phone coverage as wifi useless found myself alternative hotel amadeus in city centre highly recommended for remainder of my stay this hotel is for those who want to get away from it all including emails
