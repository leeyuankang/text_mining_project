we booked the room on booking com as a kind of special offer i thought that the price was lower because we had pay for the room right after the booking at the hotel it turned out that the price was lower because they put us in a room where we could hear the noise of the elevator it was quite embarrassing fortunately the staff immediately provided us with a new room where we could sleep well the price was also lower because breakfast was not included we had to pay for that at the reception and it costed per person which was a little bit high compared to the breakfast
