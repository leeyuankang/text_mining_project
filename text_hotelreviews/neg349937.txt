there were no normal teabags and no normal milk for tea there was only coffee and herbal tea and coffee creamer although i m sure if we asked they would have provided this was a bit weird that they charged for the same coffee satchels in the reception as what was in your room we had no sugar so i had to ask and this was just handed to me free of charge so did not quite understand why they charged the shower was not as powerful as what i would have like but the bathroom was very clean and towels were changed everyday if required i was a bit annoyed that when me and my friend decided to relax in the outdoor seating area at i was refused a coffee as they had shut down the machine yet they were serving other drinks and there were plenty of people outside still drinking the worst thing was the breakfast although there were plenty of options in the buffet to choose from i thought the breakfast was hugely overpriced at around each i ate out for cheaper than that and had a full lunch with drinks at the hotel and it was cheaper than that was quite shocked at the price music channels on the tv would have been good
