be warned it you re travelling by public transport there is a walk from the nearest metro or tram stop to the hotel through an industrial zone this is well flagged up on the hotel website but it may present a challenge if you have a lot of luggage and the weather conditions are not ideal the directions to reach the hotel on foot are non trivial so pay careful attention to them the seating round the bar is a bit unusual not very cosy comfortable nor conducive to social mixing
