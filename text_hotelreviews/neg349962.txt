no milk in the room for tea or coffee no water bottle in the fridge breakfast not included in the price otherwise it is euros the style of the rooms is modern but dark and a bit gloomy the bathroom door wouldn t close properly and curtains don t reach the floor which leaves day light in the room in early morning no shops around as the hotel is located in a business park the tram is a walk and it takes to reach the town center in holland no restaurants would give you free tap water in a jug with your meal this is very disappointing your tap water is drinkable so you could at least give it for free like they do in most other european countries sorry but this is very petty
