there was dirty underwear from a previous guest so i m not sure how clean the room actually was also the reception takes a very long time it took me minutes to get my bag from reception when we went to collect them we didn t have breakfast there as the price was shocking for what you were offered the bed was so uncomfortable that both myself and my husband have terribly sore backs
