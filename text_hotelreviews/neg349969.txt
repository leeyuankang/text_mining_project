the heater and the window insulation was inadequate to bring the temperature warm inside the room and it was uncomfortably cold in the room especially early in the morning it is far from the tourist central and the public transport station is far for asian standard to walk and no one else is around while you walk from the public bus or tram station to the hotel for to minutes after pm i dont recommend this place to anyou tourist
