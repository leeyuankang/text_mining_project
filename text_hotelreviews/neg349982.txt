staff was rude on arrival as she stated i need the payment card or i would not be able to stay which lead me to have to pay again with a different card and for small period i had paid twice whilst waiting for a refund even tho it had all been paid for since november also on check out they tried to charge me for breakfasts that i hadn t had which ended a good stay badly
