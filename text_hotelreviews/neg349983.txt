in my opinion the staff were very rude on arrival we booked with a credit card which i previously had called and spoken to one of the booking com members of staff about as we could use it for booking but where not able to take away with us we where assured that it would be fine however we may need to leave a small deposit or a debit credit card with them so they had something they could charge us to if we were to leave without paying at check in the woman immediately asked for the credit card i explained the situation and she was very rude and told me booking com had nothing to do with the situation i should have rang and spoken to them directly after a slight disagreement she finally allowed us to use the room without a credit card but i left the reception feeling embarrassed and not valued at all
