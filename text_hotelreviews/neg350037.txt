for us the hotel was a bit out of the way ideally we would have liked a more central location but it was very easy to get into central amsterdam on public transport so we can t really complain we didn t eat at the restaurant at the hotel as it was a bit beyond our budget so can t comment on the food we didn t realise we would have to pay city tax on arrival on top of what we already paid so bear this in mind
