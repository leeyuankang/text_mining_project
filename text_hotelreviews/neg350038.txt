when i booked my stay i was told breakfast would be included and i payed more for it to be however when i tried to get breakfast i was told it wasn t included alough i know i paid for it it was very frustrating because we were expecting breakfast and couldn t get any food until we went into the city center which was a pretty far distance from the hotel also the nearest tram was almost a ten minute walk and that made it difficult to travel with luggage
