minor negative things at our arrival there were some spots on the fabric on the bed our room door had to be really slammed in order to close properly and we made sure each time to check it when we left the room one night when we came back to the hotel we found the door improperly closed by cleaning staff leaving our luggage at the disposal of anyone passing by our room fortunately nothing happened but this might remind the cleaning staff to check each door after they have finished their tasks
