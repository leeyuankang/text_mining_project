we had to change room when we arrived we booked a superior double room and arrived at the hotel at and went to the bar after we had our room key we got back to our room about and realised that the queen size bed was in fact single beds pushed together we called reception to ask to change rooms and the guy was really rude he said that s how they do queen size beds and he would see if there s anything could do but in a very patronising tone we had ordered pizza to the room just before we complained and we went down to speak to him about the room and the pizza was already at reception he did not bring it to the room or offer to help us carry it at all but still charged the room service charge and kept the change he was very rude at reception again saying that it s very late and asking why we didn t notice it until now when we checked in at which i thought was completely irrelevant so we were told to go and wait in our room until he sorts it out so we carried our pizza up and had to sit in a room which wouldn t be ours we had ordered it to eat in bed and watch tv and the pizza was cold as we d been at reception for so long however when he did come back to the room they gave us a free upgrade to a business room which i have to say was a lovely room the guy at reception was blonde and had just started the night shift on thursday may cleaner came everyday which was good but did not replace the glasses and did not replace the miniature body lotion
