staff seemed to be rushing all the time even when dealing with customers when in the room interior seemed bit outdated we noticed dirty spots on the walls and floor also tiles and glass door didn t seem to meet standard of cleanliness i expected room was chilly even when temperature was set to highest so i kept bathroom door open all the time to get more warmth furniture a day doors were scratched and the view was poor seeing construction sight and one of the windows didn t had curtain maybe on purpose but seemed that there should be one we were not able to use free wifi only if we sat just by the door in our room internet connection was really bad we addressed this issue twice but nothing changed they just told that a lot of people might be using it and that s way it s so bad some tv programs didn t work when it was raining the hotel was a bit far from center but if you don t mind min walk through the park back and forward to public transport and then ride in it you will be fine
