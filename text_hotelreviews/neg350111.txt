tv is very old maybe could be updated with new models eg tvs do not support hdmi is very common travelers go in a trip with our own apple tv or google chrome and we cannot use it breakfest during the morning is high expensive almost euros per day person could be more cheap the most part of the guests used to go to supermarket to buy groceries and make your own breakfest wifi is terrible
