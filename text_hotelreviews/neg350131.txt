the rooms were hardly ever cleaned when towels were taken only single bath towel was replaced and with no face clothes or hand towels and this was the same with the soaps and shampoos which were not replaced there were no coffee cups or coffee tea in my room and i had to leave a note asking for the cleaning staff to provide them as well as soap for the bathroom as well my colleague who was staying in another room on the same floor came back to find that his toilet had been used and that the item was not flushed that s really not a great surprise to come back to
