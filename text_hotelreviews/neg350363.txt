when you first walk into this hotel after the surprise of the not so nice street view you could be mistaken into thinking that the four stars it has been awarded are merited in fact the only parts of the hotel that merit four stars are the public areas we were given the keys to our room and made our way up in the lift to the shabbiest room i have had the misfortune to be allocated i left the cases there and returned to reception where i was given another slightly larger slightly less shabby room i don t know if these rooms are given to those booking on this website or if this is the standard of all of the rooms if it is steer clear don t get me wrong most all of the staff were pleasant and helpful and they are a credit to mecure however based on the quality of the room i would struggle to award three stars the bathroom was falling to bits and badly designed the shower was hanging off the wall and the screen was square to fit a curved corner bath meaning water went everywhere the tap on the wash hand basin was activated by a sensor making brushing your teeth a task in its self with one hand against the sensor to ensure the water ran and washing your face almost impossible each day a no smoking sign was placed on our bed we booked the room knowing it was non smoking so this felt a little bizarre especially given the nicotine coloured wallpaper adorning the walls there was an up holstered chair in the room covered in dirty marks there were two bottles of complimentary water in the fridge both sparkling when we asked for still water we were told we would have to pay for it no coffee facilities and no ironing facilities in the rooms you could access an ironing room with your room key i don t have mine with me when i was shown to this room and earned a tut and dirty look for this
