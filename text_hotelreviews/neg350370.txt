the wi fi was intermittent there were no refreshments in the rooms facilities to make drinks except two complimentary bottles of water the buffet breakfast was very good but i thought that i had booked it as included i always do if that is an option when we came to breakfast and signed our rooms we were not advised that we would have to pay so when we checked out i was surprised by the additional cost of six breakfasts i could not explain this to the receptionist as my german was not good enough i do not know if this error was in terms of my communication with the hotel or bookings com the airport shuttle advertised on the website was more expensive than i had thought
