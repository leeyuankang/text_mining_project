the hotel is on a one way street so if you miss it expect to take the circuit again not much parking outside the hotel when its busy we did a nifty reversing move to get into the hotel parking garage a bit further back up the street our sat nav really didn t like the tall buildings so we went around a couple of times till we figured where we were going and where the hotel parking was located
