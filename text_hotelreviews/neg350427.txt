someone had faked our name on a breakfast bill and they tried to charge us for that as we were leaving time was tight and the front desk said that they couldn t authorize taking it off the bill without the manager who wasn t there i was really upset as it was clearly not us as we would never have had breakfast without our children in the end we weren t charged for it on our credit card but they insisted on blocking the amount on my credit card until the manager did whatever he had to do it was just an unfortunate end to what had been a pleasant stay otherwise
