the glass in the bathroom was not clean used cups and glasses were not replaced i asked if it was possible to get a kettle and some tea and was told to wait until they came with a loaded tray which they handed to me and i had to juggle up to my room after a long day loaded with bags when the room above was occupied it was very noisy very heavy footsteps creaky floorboards between midnight and then again at at the end of my stay i asked if they would book a taxi for my early departure he said just turn up down here about minutes before you want to leave the hotel itself is quite nice but from my experience of staying in many hotels around the world they would have to be some of the most complacent and disinterested reception staff i have ever encountered i am not a demanding person i am always courteous and respectful but it seemed like asking them for anything was an imposition
