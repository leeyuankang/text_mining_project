we had a mishap with our taxi booking during the last day of our stay we asked the hotel reception to book a taxi for us we needed a large one because of luggage when the taxi was late and we started to get nervous minutes delay the reception staff was really unhelpful saying that taxi is coming as a result it came with a minutes delay vs the original booking and actually the lady from the reception run after us stating that we need to wait for another taxi that she has booked for us while the first one was late it was frustrating no apologies were offered to us and our questions about the taxi seemed to be burdensome for the reception
