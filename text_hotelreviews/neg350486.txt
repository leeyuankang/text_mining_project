the room was of a decent size but the bathroom was tiny there was a strong smell of dampness in the room we told the staff about it as soon as we got into the room and they offered to place a call for the cleaners to apply some sort of products to get rid of it the smell did not go away so we had to keep the window opened in as much as possible the issue was not correctly addressed by the hotel staff who otherwise were polite
