tea and coffee making facilities in the room would have been nice our room looked out onto an atrium and as it was hot we had the windows open rather than use the air conditioning however there was some noise coming from the atrium with people laughing and talking i m not sure if this was guests or hotel staff however as the majority of rooms look out onto it it really should be closed at night that said the noise had stopped by midnight it
