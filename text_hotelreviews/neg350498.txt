we couldn t watch a movie on our ipad as the internet in the hotel only allows you to watch minutes and then you re timed out of the internet for hours all the channels were in german except for sky news therefore we couldn t chill out in the room for a few hours watching the tv after a long day of sight seeing we asked the concierge where is a nice area for restaurants and bars and she recommended a specific street myself and my boyfriend travelled to this street only to find a shopping district with macdonalds and turkish kebabs we then ended up walking for a long time trying to find a decent restaurant we also wanted a tour of a vineyard which can be found just outside of the city and the concierge advised us how to go about this it took us over an hour to get there and only to find that no one can just walk in and get a tour as they have to be apart of a group we weren t told this and feel that the hotel should have known this fact it wasted our time
