this hotel give me an impression that they are very desperate they promoted to us every chance from the moment we check in until check out first they ask if we would like to up grade our room for a night when we ask for slippers in the room we were reminded that our standard room don t come with facilities like slippers and toiletories and speaking of standard star hotel room there is no kettle when we ask if standard room comes with kettles they just said they will give them when they ask for it make me think if this hotel don t have enough kettles to go around and when we want to claim for our hours late check out from the genius they ask if we want to extend it to hrs for it s just annoying that they don t forget to promote their extra pay service in every conversation you have with them when we didn t even ask for it have to say though the staff are quite prolite despite of the annoying promotion tactics we did pay extra for the breakfast it was standard but we did enjoy it about the room it s quite dated you can smell the carpet as soon as you walk in toilet seat fell off the first time i used it coz it s a clip on toilet seat and it wasn t clip on properly overall i would say standard rooms in this hotel is a star and if you upgrade you may get star facility which we never know because we never upgraded
