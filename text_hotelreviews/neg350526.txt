about the facilities the hotel mentions in its description that they have parking spaces for customers with cost of per day this info was critical for our decision when choosing the hotel but the spaces are really very few and are used mainly by the hotel s fleet when we asked for a place to park our car the staff did not care they just gave us some options of public parking around the hotel very expensive also when we did check out the staff told us that we should have reserved the parking but the reservation web page says private parking available reservation is not possible
