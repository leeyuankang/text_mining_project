the air conditioning was not working because they still consider the time to be winter but it was already warm weather and so at night it was very hot also the menu for room service has only pizzas or baguettes no other options like salads or even desserts also we left the room service dishes the night before and when we came back the day after they were still in the room even after cleaning was supposed to be done
