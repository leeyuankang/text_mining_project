the standard room was very small just enough space to go around the bed ambiance of the room was poor it was a standard room in every sense we stayed for nights and the cleaning the next day depended very much on the person who did it some days questionnable not enough towels or wet towels not changed etc other days excellent i was left with a feeling that the stay was not worth the money
