really minor things that did not had an impact on the amazing time we had there sunbeds by the pool were changed and the new ones are no longer reclinable eventhough the staff is amazing one particular member does not seem to fit in when it comes to the amazing customer service everyone else provides this is kristina that was on the breakfast area one of the days not particularly friendly makes you feel that even if you ask for an extra napkin that is a hassle on your way out says a very dry bye while everyone else is lovely and makes you feel welcome the hotel is starting to show small signs of wear and tear but can imagine that is being dealt with as for instance the sunbeds seem to have been replaced computers were running a little slow
