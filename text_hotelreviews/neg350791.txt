we stayed here while attending the primavera sound festival which is a ten minute walk from hotel vincci bit while it s a handy location for revellers at the festival or business people visiting the parc del forum at other times of the year it s a bit too far out for enjoying the city centre the airport can be reached by taking the metro to el clot where you then get a train or get a taxi the local area is a little bit run down and is residential it has a few basic caf s but no bars or restaurants having said that two metro lines are on the doorstep as is the tram and journeys to catalunya top of the main shopping street las ramblas or jaume i heart of the bustling raval area take about minutes you can walk along avinguda diagonal up to glories in about minutes where several museums and the beginning of the city centre can be found it s a nice broad tree lined avenue
