rooms are not sound proofed and it gets really loud despite being on a higher floor we could still hear people talking on the street it also was quite loud when guests above walked through their room wearing heels the cleaning staff did not help getting some rest as they kept slamming doors and furniture throughout the rooms really badly from the beginning of their shift in the morning despite the racket though they avoided doing the bed properly some days and just tucked in the sheets leaving the filling exposed we would not have minded this so much if we had not suffered from them being so loud
