if you don t like long beach walks to downtown barcelona or prefer more authentic and lively neighborhoods do not chose this location as you would have to use cabs or long public transport rides to reach the center of barcelona nothing important but i was given a token for a free drink upon arrival to be used when ordering food only i forgot to use it at night when i had dinner at the inside restaurant bar the day i was leaving when i got back in the afternoon to pick up my stored luggage to leave for the airport i was very thirsty and asked if i could get water in exchange for the free drink and presented the token at the inside bar but the free drink token was bluntly refused because i did not order food with it at that moment after a four day stay and dinners on site and coming straight from travelling in asia where culture service are very generous it just seemed pretty cheap to me
