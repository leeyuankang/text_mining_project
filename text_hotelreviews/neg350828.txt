sewage smell in hotel room we kept the windows open even at night but it did not help we noticed that there were some undesirable type of guests in the hotel the kind of people you would not expect in a star hotel no sound insolation the noise of the neighbouring rooms and those talking in the corridor would disturb your night sleep the toilet is not cleaned even if you flush for several times so you end up using toilet papers to clean it up you put the towel on the floor to be changed but when you come back you find out that they have just folded the dirty towels and put them back in the shelf
