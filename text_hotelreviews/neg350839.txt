it was impossible to take shower without making bathroom floor all wet and i mean impossible first time i thought that maybe i didn t close shower door good enough or something no later i was as careful as i could asked staff to clean the drainage so water comes out quicker and put cloth near the door still some water on the floor there must be a leak in tiles or something like that a lady at reception crumbled my passport and had so grave accent so i thought she was speaking spanish to me while it was english they tried to double charge my credit card after checkout though i already paid the bill and didn t answer to my e mail regarding this though at checkout i informed them that i need to pay for mini bar usage buy the man at reception told me that i don t need to strange to get to gym you need to get a special key at reception but honestly you shouldn t it was the smallest hotel gym i have ever seen probably it was smaller than my room there were three aerobic machines and two or three couples of dumbbells and two kettle bells as i recall biggest one kg probably oh and yes i came at midday to hear that my room is ready and i can check in right now for euros not that i think they must let me check in earlier but that is so petty
