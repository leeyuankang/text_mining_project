in my opinion the hotel is dishonest by putting together for the same price the twin and double rooms on the booking page right near near the room selection you have the possibility to pick between two options large double bed single beds i chose large double bed but surprisingly or not as i have understood later when i got there the room had small beds don t think that they ve been considerate enough as to let me know prior to going up to the room upon me calling the front desk the answer was cold and short i m sorry sir that is only a preference so it s optional for us they offered me the option to change the room for the second night of my stay conditioned that i come to the front desk in the morning before noon and let them know i said ok so again i ve compromised in spite of their uncaring attitude the second day around when i got there surprise the hotel is fully booked and no large bed rooms are available i tried explaining that they have suggested we do this with just hours before the only answer to all my raised issues was we re sorry we re sorry i talked to booking which have proven to be of the slightest help in this matter also the hotel suggested it is their fault for placing the selection of the beds there in a deceiving way nothing could have been done i was very upset and i really believe that i was entitled to be so as even if the bed selection that was a preference why would you make me select something that you don t intent to offer at all it s like asking me if i would like some coffee and then say we re sorry we don t have any coffee why ask in the first place moreover my reservation together with the preference was booked and paid for with a month before my stay so in fact it s if at that time the hotel had a room which matched my requirements and preferences they were supposed to keep
