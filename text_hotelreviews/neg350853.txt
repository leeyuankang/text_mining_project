when booking the room i obtained a huge discount on the room price which meant that for nights of accomodation for a standard double room the full price would have been eur instead i paid eur the hotel is definitely not a eur per three nights one and is a bit pricey for what you get also there are not sufficient toiletries in the bathroom housekeeping is performed even though you leave the do not disturb sign and you expressly mention you don t want your room to be cleaned they go through your stuff and the breakfast is really poor i would not go back
