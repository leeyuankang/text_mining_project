i would expect a cleaner room from a stars hotel moreover there was no air or a windows into the bathroom so after a shower all the room was very hot you had to turn on air conditioning to took off the condensation even if august the room was very moist and the beach towels did not dry at night since there was no place where to hang them they gym consists in tools only plus a little place where you could do some work on the floor the swimming pool is very little and only meter high not sure why but they do not provide a toilet brush in the bathroom i would not come back to this hotel as the price is not consistent with the service offered
