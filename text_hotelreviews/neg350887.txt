the bar were too busy to bring drinks to the roof terrace despite offering it as a service i booked a double room but should have double checked as it was actually a double or twin and the twin beds slid apart so not great for a couple the shower was weak the location is good in terms of the closeness of the beach and there was a nice beach bar at the very start of the beach but if you re looking to be more central then this is maybe not for you as it requires a taxi in out of the city centre
