the breakfast was good but the same every day when you stay for multiple days a change is nice they do have a good variety of options though location is great when you re at a convention in the convention centre it s quite far away from the centre of town mins by taxi but then that costs about euro s to get there so it s not too bad we tried to find find the beach and while we got to the seafront easily enough the beach was harder to find
