i wonder about no carpets or mats when one gets into bed in particular i very much enjoyed the wine in the mini bar and my son the beer in the lounge access on the property to hard alcohol might have been nice addition the spa gym was an added benefit i would have welcomed a more open space or a window for the tread mill maybe even a second choice of cardio equipment and some free weights the tread mill sunk in the astroturf was an interesting idea tho
