i felt at times the desk staff seemed a little rattled with requests had previously arranged an extra bed for my daughter and was told the price via email when i inquired about the setup staff looked a bit dismayed and told me the house staff has gone home but i suppose i will get it done amd that is the wrong price inspite of showing the letter from the email not really the best answer considering i was asking in the morning for later that evening with that we didnt bother asking for advice etc again so while everyone was friendly i think a little work could be done there overall an excellent hotel and i would definitely stay there again and once again brilliant setup and people for the breakfast bravo
