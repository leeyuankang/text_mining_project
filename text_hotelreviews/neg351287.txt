everything was a tad pricey but it s what you d expect to pay in a high end hotel establishment however the one big disappointment was the fact that smoking is allowed in the lounge bar and my husband and i couldn t sit in there on a number of occasions as the smoky atmosphere was too unpleasant and due to having had a lung transplant i cannot stay in smoky conditions for obvious reasons it s a real shame as it s a beautiful bar really comfortable with pleasant staff and a great atmosphere
