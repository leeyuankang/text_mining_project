i would sum up this hotel as faded grandeur it s a little tired and could use some updating also the bar allowed smoking one of our vacation highlights is to get a drink to discuss the day s events but we couldn t stand sitting in a smoke filled lounge one night it was pouring and we wanted to get a light dinner there but couldn t stand the thought of eating in a smoky bar so we had to go out also the lobby is not much of a traditional lobby there were six club chairs there not a place to congregate it was a hotel which in it s day i m sure was grand but now not really the staff was very polite and helpful but overall i think it was overpriced
