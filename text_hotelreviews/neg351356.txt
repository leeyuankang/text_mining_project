the bar area was a little small we would have liked a drink in the bar after dinner but some tables had been reserved and some had only or people sat at them most tables had armchairs around them so if only person was sat there it left no availability for others to sit down the bar staff also did not seem as friendly or attentive as other staff members and if you were not sat at a table did not seem in a hurry to serve you
