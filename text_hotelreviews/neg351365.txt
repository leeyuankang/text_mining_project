we decided to treat ourselves and have breakfast at the hotel even though it is not cheap we though it would make a perfect end to our holidays however the cafe let the hotel down we ordered coffee and it only arrived after a reminder husband ordered an omelette and i the fruit salad we had expected to eat together but the omelette came first and husband had all but finished it before my fruit arrived this should not happen it can t be too difficult to get the two items ready at the same time service seems chaotic but i can t understand why it should be so in a hotel
