we got a room without curtains so the room was fully bright at when the sun came up i really think curtains are an essential feature of any hotel let alone a star luxury hotel we were really tired and had to change rooms also the cleaners talked loudly to each other for about an hour at which also woke us up on other days they also didn t replace the toiletries in the bathroom so we had to call reception and ask for them the tables at breakfast were jammed in really close and on the first morning a toddler who was from us threw his toy at my wife then the eggs we ordered took forever to arrive and we had to sit and watch the couple next to us eat theirs and leave even though we ordered at the same time also smoking was allowed in the bar which made it off limits to me i d be disappointed if this happened in a mediocre star hotel for per night but in a supposedly luxury hotel at this price it is ridiculous
