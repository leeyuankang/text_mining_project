the hotel is boutique in terms of the foyer which is very small as are the lifts the corridors are quite narrow so it can feel a little claustrophobic my room was on the floor and looked over the inner courtyard this meant it was dark enough to need the lights on all the time which i personally dislike having to do i was disappointed to be paying over for a room with an internal view but i had asked for a quiet room and it was blissfully silent so perhaps this was the reason on their website it states that most x ordinary rooms come with a walk in wardrobe which mine didn t have which again i was disappointed about as what girl doesn t want a walk in wardrobe perhaps i was given this room as it was for single occupancy the gym is small but well equipped located in the attic or top floor it has low ceilings so again is a little claustrophobic i loved this hotel but it was beyond my budget to stay for longer than one night so having booked for nights the hotel kindly allowed me to change my booking at the last minute to one night only when i checked out i was aware they had smaller lower priced rooms available and was curious as to whether or not one of these might be offered they were not as i had not yet booked anywhere else but needed a room for another nights this was a missed opportunity for them
