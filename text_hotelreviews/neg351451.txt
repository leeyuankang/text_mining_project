the hotel is cleverly decorated and looks luxurious and comfortable at first glance however the amenities and furniture are a cheap imitation of a real star hotel friendly receptionists are dressed in ill fitting uniforms trying to make you feel welcome however they can not take the attention of the poorly decorated reception and cafeteria style breakfast room the hotel is situated right at the city center which is really great but arriving at the hotel is difficult because there is no possibility for taxis to park and the tramline runs right next to the hotel lastly the complementary internet connection in the rooms is slow and disconnects so you barely can check and answer your emails having said this the hotel is nice and very central but should not be graded a star hotel
