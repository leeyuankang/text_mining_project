i reserved the standard room and got a very small one with only a tiny window worn out decoration non functioning air conditioning and a strange smell in the room that type of a room one would expect in a grumpy three star hotel but not in a hotel that is marked as five stars in the booking com after the first night i felt cheated and decided that i will check out next morning and change to a better hotel
