the poor lighting in the bedroom the bulb wattage was low and the room always felt semi dark and it was difficult to read literature fortunately we had torches and we had to resort to using them or moving into the bathroom to read i would like to suggest that the room should have at least light lamp with a high wattage bulb perhaps the desk lamp the breakfast was poor value it would be preferable to have the ability to mix choices more than only have the two set menus the cost of breakfast was ridiculous and to charge each time we ordered a pot of coffee for two when each post only held small cups worth was off putting the coffee wasn t even of a good standard we resorted to going across the road to a brilliant place called chillai and having a much better breakfast the coffee is fantastic there
