the kavalier bar was totally dominated by the very strong smell of cigarette cigar smoke the evening we attempted to have drinks there we could literally see a haze of smoke all over the room plus there is the smell that accompanies this and the knowledge that had we stayed it would have been transferred to our clothes even walking into the hotel from the street into the reception area there is the smell of stale cigarette smoke coming from a country where smoking is viewed differently in detracted from what was a very enjoyable holiday however the lobby bar staff more than made up for the missed opportunity by providing a first class drinks service in a smoke free area
