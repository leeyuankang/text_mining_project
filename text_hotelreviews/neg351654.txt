felt like we were nickel and dimed only one bottle of water was complimentary during our whole day stay we stayed over christmas and nothing really special was offered to guests to make this a special day in the hotel disappointed that they would not let us extend our check out for even one hour and unfortunately our last impression was fairly negative the grand hotel wien bellhop along with a taxi driver that hotel called for us were both trying hard to convince us that a taxi ride to the vienna airport was same price as the train euro when we asked them why they were trying to exploit us as we knew we could get train tickets at euro for persons times less the cost they said it was not true and then the taxi driver complained the whole way to train station and he drove a route twice as long as he needed to and charged us for the extra distance on his meter then he dropped us and our many bags far from train station saying he couldn t get any nearer not true as other taxis were dropping clients at station and it was raining our trip to vienna and always in other hotels the staff have always protected us and taken care of us better
