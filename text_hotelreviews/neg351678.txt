this is the first time in my whole life that happened to me when i requested from room service a plate with a knife and i was surprised with the answer from the room service staff of charging me a euro for that it never happened to me eventhough in a or star hotels so what about star hotel the other thing is that my booking was for a superior double or twin room and when i got to the hotel at the time of checking in the hotel front desk staff told me that my booking is for the standard room but i noticed that when i checked into the room so i didn t want to move and my family with my kids and my luggage to another room in different floors and the hotel had enough time to arrange that since the time of booking
