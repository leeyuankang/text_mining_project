restaurant meal on first evening not particularly good they have a sign asking for no mobiles in the restaurant but we were plagued by people around us constantly making and taking calls and loudly very inconsiderate and staff took no notice we had breakfast included but were still charged again for one of us having just porridge in the room when my wife was taken ill thought this very unreasonable
