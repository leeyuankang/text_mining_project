room was so hot we turned off the heating all together and opened the window which meant we heard a bit of street and pedestrian traffic at night bathroom was too warm and we couldn t turn off the towel rail or underfloor heating so propped the door open which improved the air flow fine for showering and washing a bit too hot to stand putting on make up it would have been helpful to be able to move the hairdryer from the hot bathroom to the bedroom
