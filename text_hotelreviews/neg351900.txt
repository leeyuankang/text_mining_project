the hotel was severly hindered by its policy to allow smoking not just within certain rooms but within the bar area this meant the whole hotel smelt of stale cigerettes from the point of stepping into the hotel and despite our room being non smoking early morning and evening we could still smell the smoke in our room with most of europe having a no smoking policy i feel that this was not necessary and would prevent me from booking again
