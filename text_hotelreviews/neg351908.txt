i had booked an expensive apartment suite this place has been completely dirty levels of dust on door frames within shelfs behind the tvs on the bed headboard and i could go on in addition dried toothpaste left overs from previous guests in shelves on the wardrobe and behind the sofa unacceptable when i then wanted to speak to the manager despite announcing it in the evening before nobody was available or reachable due to apparent no mobile number to contact him her as an experienced traveler i can recommend anybody to avoid this place
