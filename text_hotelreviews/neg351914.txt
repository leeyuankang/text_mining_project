they should ban smoking in the bar it was right next to the restaurant even though i was in a no smoking room the minute you stepped out of the room the air was full of smoke smell the smell pervaded every part of the hotel it is a disgusting habit with obvious clear health risks it s astounding that anyone should smoke or that places still allow people to smoke in their establishments anymore
