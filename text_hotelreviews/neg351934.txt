i was surprised that people could smoke inside the hotel on the floor in front of the restaurant i do not think it is now appropriate to have people smoking in closed public areas a pity that the lift did not get directly to the room on the first floor and that you had to go up some stairs not very convenient when you are carrying heavy bags
