the toiletries provided were sparse and not very good quality also the bath towels were not great and there were no extra pillows or blankets to be found in the room no iron either maybe this is normal for vienna also we were gone all day back by and no one had cleaned the room so we had to ask them to do it in the eve when we went out again
