from the moment i arrived i felt like the reception staff really didn t care about us some of them were unhelpful and not very friendly but everyone else at the restaurant and room service were nice both rooms we had were damp and one of them had a ridiculously tiny bathroom the hotel does have a lot of character however it could do with a good refurbishment the worst part is when the hotel booked us a city tour and we spent minutes outside the hotel waiting for the bus to arrive turned out that the reception didn t event call the company to check if they were coming to collect us we had to come in every minutes and ask them to follow up the hotel is really beautiful and the location is amazing but i doubt that we will come back again
