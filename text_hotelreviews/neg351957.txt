normally this hotel delivers but this time my experience was marred by no response from room service or bar to order food eventually went down to bar where it was not overly busy and placed my order although delivered in reasonable time did not feel like room service as i has not planned on leaving room secondly as is often my custom i check out before eating breakfast and inform staff upon checkout that i will be eating breakfast after i finished breakfast i was presented with the check and passed my credit card to pay for it after nearly ten minutes the waiter returned asking for cash as his machine wasn t working he then asked for my card so he could take it down to reception on another floor and charge it there i refused stating that i would take care of it myself when finished i then went to reception and tried to pay but they didn t know what to do at which time i informed them i was going to pack and would take care of it on way out mins later i returned ready to leave and they refused to take my payment stating that the waiter needed to come to the desk with my flight departure time rapidly approaching i told them i needed to leave in minute after another mins it was finally taken care of this left a very bad experience in my mouth lesson for mgmt if your staff are absent for whatever reason don t make excuses and don t inconvenience the customer because of your mistakes
