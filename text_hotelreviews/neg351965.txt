this is our second stay at hotel ambassador and to the opposite of the first visit this stay was a horror we booked the same type of top floor apartment we stayed in last time and paid the same price for what was supposed to be a square meter luxurious apartment with two floors and two big terraces but were shocked to be shown to a tiny room sitting area which could never be more than meters with no balconies or even a view and had all sloped ceilings and walls that we banged our heads on whenever we moved when we complained to the receptionist she answered us with a stony face that i cant do anything to help you and will not refund you as your booking is non refundable when i asked to talk to the manager and explained that this is not what we paid full price for as it has nothing that is shown in the websites pictures she answered coldly that yes the description of the room on booking com is a little misleading even when we asked them for simple things like cups or pans we were never even answered to cut it short our holiday was ruined by an utter disgrace of a room and the poker faced deceptive staff
