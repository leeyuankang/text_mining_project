this is our visit to this hotel and the opposite to the first time this stay was extremely disappoionting when we arrived we were shown to a top floor apartment which is shown in the pictures to have two floors with luxurious amenities and supposedly has two big balconies and written to be sqare meters but were shocked to see a tiny room sitting area which could never be more than square meters with sloped low roofs that we banged our heads around however we moved and no balconies or even a veiw to look out from the kitchenette had nothing but cups and glasses and when we asked for anything to use or to change the room we were faced with stoney faced employees that said we cant do anything to help you and we cant refund you because your booking is non refundable even if we paid a high price for what we saw in the pictures but didnt find in reality even when we talked with the manager she said maybe the description of the appartment on booking com is a little misleading to put it in one sentence our holiday was ruined by a disgrace of a so called appartment and the unhelpful poker faced staff
