super hot in the room while our stay it was in vienna our room did not have any conditioners there was only one fan that did not help at all neither did the windows they were faced to the backyard where restaurant ventpipes are located as a result two nights turned into nightmare it would be also nice to warn guests in advance that breakfast is not included in their booking and they would have to pay additional per person per night in case they want to have hotel breakfast
