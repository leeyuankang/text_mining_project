no ramp at the entrance making it uncomfortable for entering with luggage push chairs and wheelchairs when i entered my room there was a step there as well room keys are not digital so you have to remember to lock your room and leave the key at the front desk every time you leave the soap in the bathroom is from a fixed squeeze bottle instead of individual soap bar or bottle the above didn t bother me that much but i hope the hotel takes it as feedback to continuously improve
