the single room was too small it was ok for the purpose of my visit but not comfortable for longer stays or when you tend to spend more time in the room elevators are stylish but not so efficient i felt that the bathroom was not hygenically cleaned after the previous occupant also bathroom amenities were not regulary supplied
