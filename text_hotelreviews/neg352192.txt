the beds were extra firm and the pillows had no loft we all had difficulty sleeping on the mattress and pillows i finally asked if they had a pillow for my neck which was hurting from the lack of support the desk staff was able to provide me with a foam neck pillow which helped a lot also the room stayed hot all the time we would leave the windows open during the day and at least one open at night we were there in mid november there was no way to control the heat in the room also the bar was closed most nights only one evening during our stay was it open so don t expect to come back and have a drink at the bar before going to room
