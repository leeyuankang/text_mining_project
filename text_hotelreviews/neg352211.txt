the noise of the bin trucks early every morning this is not the hotels fault it is something that has to be expected in an area of the city that has so many excellent restaurants and bars both inside and out on the streets a good set of earplugs remedies this problem and shouldn t stop anyone from staying in this lovely hotel in a fantastic location with everything on its doorstep and perhaps better bar facilities in the hotel would be good but with so many locally it s not a problem
