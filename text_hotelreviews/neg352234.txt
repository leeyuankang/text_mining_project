no airconditioner room was c at night they give you a fan which only circulates the hot air it does not cool the room smoking everywhere they permit smoking guests to stand directly in the hotel entrance doorway to smoke non smokers must walk through a massive cloud of cigarette smoke to enter exit the hotel lobby reception staff member on duty miguel advised me he cannot move the smokers away from the entrance because the smokers choice to stand in entrance is protected by vienna city law bs they show little care for non smokers they have an excellent location and will always be busy so they don t need to offer any good customer service they support smokers
