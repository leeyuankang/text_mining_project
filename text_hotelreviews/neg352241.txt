the central location might sound a good thing but the room partitioning and lack of double glazing in street facing rooms meant that this was the noisiest hotel we have stayed in for a long time you cannot get to sleep before midnight due to the noise from the tourist street karntner str then around am every morning you get a loud wakeup call from lorries doing street cleaning bottle bin emptying and deliveries to nearby shops and restaurants avoid if you value a good nights sleep it does not matter which floor or side of the hotel you stay in the noise is always there
