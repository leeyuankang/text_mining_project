despite the description on the webpage and also the photograph i have the impression that we were allocated the worst room in the hotel on the mezzanine level with a sole minuscule and almost blind window and as a result no sunlight whatsoever overlooking the air conditioning installations and noisy fans as well as the garbage containers which were noisily emptied at around we thought we were going for a comfort room with two bright windows am i to deduct that booking through booking com guarantees you a stay in the worst rooms in hotels
