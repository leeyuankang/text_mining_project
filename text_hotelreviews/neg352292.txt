reception staff that did not care our son was ill and needed a straw for drinking their reply was bar is closed not a single attempt to help at the end of the stay they gave me a wrong parking ticket that made me pay euro extra for parking small apology but no reimbursment will never go there again overall impression of a bad star hotel
