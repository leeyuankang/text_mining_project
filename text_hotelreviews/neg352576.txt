it was really hot in the west facing room around we had deliberately reserved a place with ac since there was a mini may heat wave we complained and a man with a wrench came up and fiddled for a few minutes it didn t do much good to cool down the room the cooler ran all night but it never dropped below it got very cold the next day so it wasn t a big deal for the price i would expect ac that works efficiently
