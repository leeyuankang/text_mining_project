the room is very worn and shows signs of heavy use the cleanliness was on the low side as well especially the floor walls and the bathroom the windows do not provide ample protection from the noise coming from the pedestrian street which is right below so the whole day it is very loud the bed is something usually found in star hotels standard uncomfortable plank which provides almost no comfort at all the air conditioner is old inefficient and loud at whatever setting the staff was also not particularly friendly and helpful overall not worth the money
