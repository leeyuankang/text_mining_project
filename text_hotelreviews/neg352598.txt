bed is so stiff and uncomfortable the elevator in this hotel is so weird couple of steps to reach the elevator with no ramp for wheelchairs or strollers even though i booked a superior executive room and requested a room with big windows i got a room with small window and the staff at the reception was trying to sell me a room for extra price to get a bigger window the quality and taste of food for breakfast isn t that great
