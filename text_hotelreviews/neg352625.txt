please do not consider it as did not like but just heads up if you are going to book room there there are couple of stairs from entrance to elevator that was not an issue for us to carry stroller and staff was ready to help but i suggest to check in advance if you have stroller or wheelchair how to get to elevators standard classic room has no free tea or coffee which usually you will find in star hotels
