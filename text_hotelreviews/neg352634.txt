i paid euros for valet parking per night and then found that my gas tank had been siphoned the desk people suggested i pay an emergency service for fuel euros i told them that this problem was their concern but no one was willing to do anything i did receive excellent directions to the closest service station but left with concerns when you pay nearly cad per day for parking their response was inadequate i did make it to the service station and found i had l in reserve not a happy customer
