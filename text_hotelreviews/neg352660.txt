we were due to check in at but we could only check in an hour later we were given a room with a faulty door handle which prevented us from going in and out of our room without someone from their cleaning staff to come and unlock it for us when we pointed this out we were not given a different room but simply had to deal with this we asked for a quiet family suite and were given a smoking room which smelled of smoke and stale carpet we booked for a family of and it was not until we requested for our sofa bed to be made that it was done despite checking us in late the sofa bed was not comfy at all it had a huge gap and our poor backs are still struggling to recover when we tried to close the curtains at night the curtains fell right off the rails the only positive is that we only stayed one night
