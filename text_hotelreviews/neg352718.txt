i have no idea how this hotel got a star rating it s more like the hose of the shower head was severely leaking which made it difficult to shower it was difficult getting out of the bath because of how high it is in comparison to the floor faulty wiring at the bedside lamp mysterious stains on the chairs water stains on the walls and s decor basic amenities were missing such as body lotion or a kettle with instant coffee and tea bags we rang the reception and asked for a kettle they said that they would look for one when we got it we were not given any tea or coffee to actually mix with the boiling water overpriced
