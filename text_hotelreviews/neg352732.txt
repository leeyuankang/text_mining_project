we arrived and apparently our booking was cancelled but that wasn t true i called booking and it was still active we hassled them and all went well at the end but after we were pissed off there was one lady on the front desk who is training don t bother asking her for information the idea of using a card for the elevator is tricky if u forget the card in your room or if it s deactivated you are trapped
