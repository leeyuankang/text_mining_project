the hotel guide stated that staff at reception would order food in should you wish to stay in the weather was terrible and it was dark and as a solo traveler i did not want to leave the hotel to find something to eat when i went to reception about the woman at reception was extremely rude and unwilling to help i had to explain that in the hotel guide it clearly states that they will be happy to order food in i explained that i would need help translating the menus she eventually provided which she rolled her eyes at she sighed and huffed throughout the process of ordering my food making me seem like an inconvenience there were no other guests waiting to be served and barely anyone in the restaurant area it was a shame because i really enjoyed my stay at the hotel apart from the attitude of this one young woman
