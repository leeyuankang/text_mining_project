my room faced the courtyard which can be noisy but closing window helps construction weekdays starts at so be prepared to be woken up by scraping on concrete mid sept only hangers which wasn t enough for me no safe fridge or luggage rack which would have been nice didn t like no dedicated reception bartenders servers also run reception walked into mirror at far wall of smallish elevator more than once hallways are dark spooky dark paint on walls ceiling no windows in hallway creates atmosphere of get to your room quick lock the door feeling liquid soap for shower but no facecloths or such to wash
