why the rank of this hotel is star the room does not have a safe telephone minibar and coffee tea maker these are the four main things that distinguish a high rank hotel from a low rank hotel the room does not have anything that a room in or star hotel should have the hotel does not have a gym i m still wondering why is it a star hotel the breakfast is for euros and very basic the nearest cafe to the hotel is opposite to the main train station and you can find the same breakfast for only euros most important thing is the closet isn t practical the closet is a collection of open boxes put together the part for hanging clothes is very narrow there is no chair in the room the chair like thing is implanted in the sofa which made neither the sofa nor the chair is comfortable or practical to use i didn t like the colors of the furniture the colors of the bed bathroom are light brown dark gray and white which is nice combination and neat but then you look around and you will see blue yellow and pink boxes in the closet side which made everything ugly and disturbing overall the room does not have a good taste except for the bath toilet sections the value is too little for the money
