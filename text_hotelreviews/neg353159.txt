the cleaning staff seems to be a bit overzealous we stayed for two nights only and left some of our laundry on the floor and the cleaning staff decided to consider it as trash and so we came back to find our dirty underwear gone d i don t want to be a nit picker but it might be a good idea to add an additional question in the booking form to ask guests if they actually want to have their rooms cleaned daily or not
