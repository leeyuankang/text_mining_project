a bit too expensive comparing to the facilities and service there is no telephone in the room to contact reception they did not provide standard toiletries such as toothpaste we had to go down to the reception and waited a long time just to be told that no toothpaste can be given for free the price of the room should be lower or at least add free breakfast into the room rate
