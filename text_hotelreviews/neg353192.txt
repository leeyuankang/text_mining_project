the hotel is situated in a new steel and glass urban development that is still not finished the streets are empty and it doesn t feel like vienna at all the only advantage of the location is its proximity to the rail station it is close to a tram station which gets you to downtown vienna in minutes however you can t really walk outside your door and feel like you re in vienna
