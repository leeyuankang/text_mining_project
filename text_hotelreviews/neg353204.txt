they asked me an extra charge euros for entering in advance in the room the first morning this never happened to me usually the hotels allow the entrance as soon as the room has been cleaned the breakfast is really good but too expensive when i went to the check out they told me that my credit card had already been charged i did not allowed them to use my credit card i gave the card number to booking only in case of no show but never allow them to any other payment i was ready to pay with cash i think they should ask at the check in which payment method the guest prefers
