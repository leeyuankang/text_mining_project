the rooms are furnished in a very stylish way which includes too many colors the ceiling is pure concrete if you like such a style you will love it personally i felt it s too much there was not much fresh vegetables at the breakfast except cucumber and tomatoes the location is nice but with constructions around and a poor view on train tracks the price is much too high
