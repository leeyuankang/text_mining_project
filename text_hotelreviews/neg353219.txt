the hotel is located in the area close to the new vienna central station the area is currently heavily under construction and therefore may feel a bit impersonal and unfinished no bars caf s nice restaurants or shops nearby nevertheless we had no issues related to noise from the construction sites i guess that once the neighbouring building are completed it will be a nice altough modern an not typically viennese area
