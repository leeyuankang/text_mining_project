our room was too hot the air con didn t seem to work so we informed a member of staff the first member of staff advised us to open a window obviously we d already done that but this really didn t make a difference as it was warm outside and the window barely opened as it was eventually we complained again and were moved rooms but i m not sure that the air con really worked in there as well second member of staff was really great and overall our experience was very good but can t imagine what it would have been like in the middle of summer as it was only between and degrees when we were there and i m usually always freezing
