cold behaving of the reception s staff by totally relaying to the automated check in system and invoice sending via email moreover i was unhappy with very unusual practice of charging of my master card immediately during the check in but the invoice i received via email days later and hours after i left the hotel the invoice was confusing with several unclear items but unfortunately i couldn t complain since i was already hours away from the hotel in addition they charged my master card with correct amount but times in smaller chunks where time in euro currency and time in hrk currency this was very confusing to me once i got master card listing from my bank
