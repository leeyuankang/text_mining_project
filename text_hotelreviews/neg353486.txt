beds were not comfortable and even though it was a double bed they used two single bed sheets not fitted which moved around and didn t fit properly the cleaner broke a glass in my room on the sunday and just left it like that i had to call someone to come get the broken pieces as i had no broom in my room by the friday i was still stepping in shards of glass as the cleaner failed to clean properly every day since the incident and despite me asking several times to vacuum the entire room my supply of coffee and sugar sachets were never replenished some days i didn t even have any neither did i have any coffee cups the breakfast options were very limited and the same every day the coffee was good though the gym consisted of one small room with a treadmill and some weights
