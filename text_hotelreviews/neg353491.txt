there are so many issues with this property it is difficult to know where to begin when arriving the first thing that struck us was the state of the landscaping weeds were growing everywhere around the perimeter of the property not a good first impression reception staff were very unhappy there was no enthusiasm for their jobs no smiles it became apparent over the length of our stay that the reason for this is due to the hotel manager he seemed very abrupt and controlling with his team and also over friendly at times so it is no wonder the staff are unhappy there are no complimentary toiletries in the bathroom this is unacceptable for an establishment that states it is star breakfast was the same every day it would have been good to see some variety common areas did not appear to be vacuumed at all our dirty dishes stayed on the restaurant table for minutes with no one coming to clear them
