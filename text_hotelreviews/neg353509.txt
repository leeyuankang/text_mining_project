reception staff generally not very helpful or friendly apart from the lady we met on arrival room not very clean dirty coffee cups leaking kettle etc had to ask for towels on day since all were removed which resulted in the aircon technician showing up in stead of the towels room very hot so had to keep window open lifts unreliable and slow breakfast not great maybe suply more fruit etc it s a decent enough hotel for a one night stop to see a gig but not recommended for a longer stay and sightseeing
