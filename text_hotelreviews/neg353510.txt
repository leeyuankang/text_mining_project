staff on reception were miserable not the greatest first impression on arrival our room was not cleaned even though we put the to be cleaned sign on the door and they were in the room next door when we left for the morning so not like we missed the chance to have it done breakfast was vile raw potatoes undercooked bacon no coffee or hot chocolate left in the machine beans had gone brown they had been there for so long aircon didn t work pretty dissapointed considering the amount paid to stay
