a very nice hotel but the whole experience was somewhat ruined by the glacial attitude of the woman at reception when we checked in no eye contact she seemed bored and annoyed by our mere presence there not at all helpful when we asked about the best way to get to the city centre we saw her at reception a few times during the stay and her attitude was the same most unpleasant to interact with her the rest of the staff especially the stagiares at reception were normal and nice
