staff behaviour when we didnt have the exact change even when we asked them to pay us back the difference balance during check out instead they said that we were being difficult the hotel is far away from any grocery store or change machine and its a pity a star hotel didnt have euros in their till to pay us back even when we checked in at at night rest the stay at the hotel was good the lady in the staff room did not show any interest in helping either and just rudely shrugged the whole deal off
