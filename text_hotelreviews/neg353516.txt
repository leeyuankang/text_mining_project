both the magnetic keys of our room couldn t open our door at the evening even if we made great attention not to keep them near the mobile phones this occured times and we found it quite annoying the cleaning service forgot to put the towels in our room and we had to ask for them at the reception unfortunately the door of our shower couldn t be closed well and each time we took a shower we ended up half flooding our bathroom i found this hotel quite expansive for the general service we received
