for a star rating i expected more than just a few green tea teabags coffee sachets and sugar sachet s and powdered milk the hotel is set on a commercial estate which is easy to get to from central station but felt very out the way we expected so much more with a charge of for breakfast on top of the room price we were glad we went out for breakfast certainly puts the minimal in minimalistic the staff however were really helpful and the beds comfy but i would recommend to anyone visiting amsterdam to try and get a room in amsterdam central there s so much to see and do that travelling odd mins from the hotel became quite a faff if we ever get another chance to see this beautiful city we will be booking into one of the cheaper hotels in the central
