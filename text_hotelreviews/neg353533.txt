unfortunately the staff was not really friendly as i arrived the check in was a bit unpleasant which shouldn t be at all i have not been informed that there was a fitness center in the hotel and the wifi didn t work in general unfortunately i wouldn t stay at this hotel again as the value for money was in the end negative
