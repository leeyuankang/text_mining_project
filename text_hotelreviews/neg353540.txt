when we arrived the staff we met were not very helpful or friendly the person who dealt with us at reception was adequate at best we were early for check in so we went into the eating area bar no one approached us in the minutes we sat in the near empty area we eventually asked the only member of staff at the bar what the arrangements were for getting something to eat and he just handed us a menu each with not even a smile from this point on we knew we would only be using the hotel for sleeping to be fair the final night as we checked out there was a really friendly and helpful girl on reception i just wished we had the same girl to greet us when we arrived the hotel is located in the middle of a business park so do not stay here for the views it is however close to the local metro so traveling around amsterdam is only minutes walk away from the hotel when using the metro
