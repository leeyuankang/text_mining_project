it was awful from housekeeping and cleaning points everything they did is just making up a bed a floor was dusty and they even didn t remove used tea packets near a teapot i m not telling about refilling our tea selection package what s so difficult about cleaning up the room if we left on am and were back by pm not even clean up the floor i was frustrated this time and will test other options nearby next time in amsterdam shame on you ozo that s not even close to stars were those egyptian ones the hotel is in a business park now views at all all rooms are decent service is not the double room has twin beds two matrasses that was not good at all
