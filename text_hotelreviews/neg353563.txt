i really don t think that you can class this hotel when i arrived there were not towels so i had to ask at the desk for some i came back to the hotel from the city around and there was no room service available nor were any of their cafes restaurants open for me to get food on the website it says that both the savoy cafe and bar are open until mon sunday but neither were open at the only way i could get food or drinks was from a vending machine with limited choices there s no way of turning off the lights which are within the bathroom mirror which meant i had a poor night sleep i feel like i am being harsh as the staff were friendly but there is no way this is a hotel and given i paid eur for night i found it a little disappointing
