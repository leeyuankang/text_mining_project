unfortunately hotel rooms wasn t very clean there was hair everywhere and finger prints even after i addressed this to reception staff i still came back to same fingerprints and hair and another very confusing disappointment was that they took money from my card couple of days in advance and also made me pay at the reception desk and i only received money back to my card weeks later as hotel is not really a value for money it was big hit on holiday budget
