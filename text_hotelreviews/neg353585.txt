when we arrived we got a room which had no proper keys working and the staff was so uninterested in helping after some tough talks the staff unwillingly gave a different room with two beds where i had requested for a king size bed later the staff came to room with a complimentary wine but for me was too late as the damage was done its annoying when you arrive late in the night driving for almost hours and you get such reception
