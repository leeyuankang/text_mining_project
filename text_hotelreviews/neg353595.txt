the hotel is in a typical business area with blocks of offices around ikea quite close too no cafes near no places to eat and nothing to see really you need to take a tube minute walk to go to the city at night one of the guests drunk was banning at our door making a lot of noise so couldn t have a peaceful night considering location far from city attractions terribly expensive not reflected in any luxury
