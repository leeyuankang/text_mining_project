the hotel is not within walking distance from the city centre nevertheless it is very close to the metro station bijlmer station once you get there city centre is less than min ride in addition connection is very frequent also some people might find the toilet a little uncomfortable since it is separated from the rest of the room not with a wall but with a somewhat transparent glass it was a little awkward but it definitely allows for more room space
