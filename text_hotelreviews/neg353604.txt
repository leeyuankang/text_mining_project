unfortunately for our first night we were give room ground floor i have never slept so poorly in a hotel before you can hear the intermittent sound of running water through the vents like sleeping next to a waterfall in the morning when we complained the staff said they knew it was a problem and they try to avoid putting people there we were given no compensation not even free breakfast and had to pretty much beg for a room change completely unacceptable that if this is a known problem that people are still being allocated these rooms some of the staff were friendly here but a couple of the reception staff really could do with smiling once in a while
