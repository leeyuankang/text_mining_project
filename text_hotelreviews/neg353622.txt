the complicated room phone with no instructions the restaurant as is today should be avoided i was served items i did not order with the explanation that s what you ordered when shown the menu the waitress response was that s the same thing as what you ordered when it clearly was not and the pillows on the beds a common complaint on this site why can this hotel not use normal pillows go to any other hotel to see what a normal pillow is if you need a detailed explanation the breakfast is uninspiring even for amsterdam standards which are relatively low includes the cheap bagged tea in the breakfast bar
