we staid nights first night we asked for extra towels as the entire bathroom was flooded after a shower the next day we told reception about that and there was a note made still our room was not clean when we came back at pm we wanted to relax shower etc before the concert but was not possible we complained at reception but staff did not handle it very well we had to tell them how to react we both work in tourism hospitality and how they could compensate it the only thing they wanted to offer was another room but we did not want that as we did not have much time and we did not want to pack and unpack again reception manager even laughed while we were explaining the matter got an email that evening from the reception manager that we get a discount and we can get that back at check out the next morning receptionist at check out did not know about the refund and supervisor was called very rude person same one who took complaint the morning before he did not want to give us the money in cash although we paid in cash and he did not admit he didn t pass our message on the morning before all together a very unpleasant experience very bad that the bar was closed after we came back from the concert approx
