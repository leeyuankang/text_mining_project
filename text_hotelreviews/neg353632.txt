everything was great apart from the location even though it is very well connected and only a short walk to the metro station we felt that it was not so nice to walk late at night from the metro station to the hotel it didn t seem unsafe but it is a very very dead area at night as it is all offices there minor nuisance the shower was leaking into the main area of the bathroom overall still a very good hotel
