i found the checking in process very time consuming it took members of staff quite a while to assist a group of people who were before me i would have called someone else to check me in but this didn t happen i wasn t apologised to either for some reason the hotel had me down for night less than i paid for and had to re activate my door key this caused problems on the real check out day as i was told i had a balance to pay which wasn t true i would rather stay somewhere else when i next visit amsterdam the hotel staff were not very polite and their lack of customer service skills was rather disappointing the buffet breakfast was extremely over priced i went into town each day and had breakfast in one of the many restaurants at a fraction of the price for what the hotel charge whether you book directly with them or via a web site i think breakfast should be included or reduced significantly
