it was the first time in my life when i have been charged twice for the rooms i have paid cash during check in after talking to their manager they said they will contact me later to deal with this i have not heard anything for a few days so i contacted them they said it was their mistake and they will send me the money back one week after still no refund and no answer from their side something it s suspicious about this hotel and their way of doing business and i will suggest no other travelers to use it also the staff from the restaurant was very untrained not courteous and a bit arrogant you cannot come directly to the table and ask what do you want to have without even showing the menu
