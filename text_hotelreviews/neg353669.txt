the most dirty hotel we have ever seen the first night that we went to sleep the sheets had hairs on it we informed the reception directly they bring another sheet which was again with hairs they have changed times the sheets and all they were dirty the staff wasn t friendly at all when we made the reservation we ask for single beds and they didn t even inform us that they don t have available single beds so i was forced to sleep with my daughter in the same bed i surely wont reccomend your this hotel
