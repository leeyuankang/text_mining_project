the iron provided had something burned on it and it in turn burned my clothing no ironing board was provided although in fairness i did not ask for one assuming one would be in the room so i had to use a small table instead insufficient toiletries were provided when i checked in and when they ran out i discovered that the phone did not work so i could not call down to reception and ask for more a check out one hour later than normal would have cost me eur which is an absurd amount of money for one hour when i checked out and asked if i could get a cup of coffee while i waited for my taxi i was told it would cost me eur which was double the price of a coffee at any of the neighboring cafes for the price i had expected better
