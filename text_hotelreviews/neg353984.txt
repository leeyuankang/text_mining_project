bathroom very poor the shower had an odd pressure and temperature hotel not cozy despite the wanna try modern lobby and bar poor welcome desk it is mainly a hotel for seminar people the room deluxe was not comfortable no attention to details we asked for beds instead of double which we asked in advance through booking but they said it was impossible and it was anyway not guaranteed with the booking the breakfast is additional and expensive almost euros the wi fi is additional very expensive for the level of service and quality honestly for your stay in amsterdam go some place else
