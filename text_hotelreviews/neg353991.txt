no milk sachets for tea too few hooks in bathroom to separate towels we didn t want towels washed after first night and it was difficult to separate and identify them without more hooks tea coffee was self service self service food is fine and it was a great breakfast but having to queue for a small mug of tea coffee was a spoiler usually in hotels of such standard pot of tea coffee is brought to your table and milk is on the table
