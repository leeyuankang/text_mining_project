this is my third trip to amsterdam with family last trips were excellent with double tree hilton but this time unfortunately very bad experience at renaissance we had booked the club room via booking com for me and my family adults and kids paid euro in advance for nights the moment we entered the hotel michael at the desk while checking in told us our booking is only for two adults and while booking through booing com it was cleared mentioned we booked for adults and kids we even mentioned the age of the kids also i had sent email requesting for two twin beds michael called booking com and made me speak to merwan that too after holding the call for mins but michael spoke the same language and said our booing is for two adults and we should pay extra to the hotel if we want to stay with the kids then a lady at the desk named sarah came in and told us we should pay extra so that she will give us another room to accommodate with the kids i requested her a lot to consider us since we already paid it will be too much for us to pay another euro but invain since we flew a long over night flight we were exhausted and ended up paying extra thinking that we could get a better room but when we went to the room which was almost half a km away from the reception and it was kind of haunting room with some odd way with cracks all over the beams and ceiling chilly air passing in from the windows and our sleep was so disturbing since lot of sound coming from the clubs outside people screaming and all i went to the desk again to michel requested him to change the room but he was only interested in collecting additional money rather than helping he said we should pay additional money if i need to change the room which i refused and ended up staying in the same room ruining our holidays i have booked many a times with booking
