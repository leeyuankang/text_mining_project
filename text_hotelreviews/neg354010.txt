the receptionists that checked us in on arrival were passing judgement and making sarcastic comments throughout please note there was people to check in therefore not each person would have been able to hear the instructions we were abruptly ordered to hand in passports and a bank card per person without any explanation i guessed it was to cover city tax room service etc however as i had already paid for the four rooms upfront last month my other guests were confused when asked if our four rooms were in close proximity the response was certainly not one member of staff asked another who are these people directly in front of me they were quite frankly rude patronising and stuck up i would have said potentially racist however the male seemed to be of an ethnic origin thankfully we did not have to interact with these two members off staff after friday evening and all the other members off staff were fantastic and overly helpful
