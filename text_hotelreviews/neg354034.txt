we travel around europe quite frequently and generally are not picky travelers but i did have some gripes about this hotel first of all as soon as we walked into our room a family sized room it smelled as if someone had just smoked a cigarette as nonsmokers with our young children and traveling with us we decided to request another room as it was bothersome we waited in the given room for about minutes for a staff member to come escort us to our new room which was conveniently located right across the hall we walked into this room and it almost smelled worse like actual garbage spoiled fruit or something we tried to find the source of the smell but could not it was clear that someone knew of the smell because the window was open when we came in we also requested a baby crib to be in the room and luckily it was already in there and set up nicely when we arrived unfortunately one of the slates was clearly broken and the top of the crib which was cloth was covered in stains boogers slobber etc the carpet and walls were filthy and the bathroom door was very difficult to open from the looks of the wood on the side of it something was broken which disrupted the functionality of it for the price that we paid close to euros a night we expected much better and were very disappointed
