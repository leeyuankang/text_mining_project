rooms are very small the walls are too thin we could hear a baby crying from updtairs throughout our entire stay phone needed to be fixed and the toilet wash basin drainage needed to be fixed ie rooms need maintenance we booked a club room assuming there is something different but the only thing different was that you get free wifi this should be a standard in all hotels by now and you get to eat breakfast in the club lounge which in reality provides you less options than the normal breakfast area additionally being a club room guest you are not allowed to have breakfast in the normal breakfast area
