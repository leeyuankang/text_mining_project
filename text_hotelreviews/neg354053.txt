i didn t like the fact the staff took over of me for nights this was due to me offering to oh early because i didn t want to carry the cash around with me or leave it in the room the check in assistant alonso had charged my card for the stay before we even discussed this i then paid in euros and he failed to mention that he had already took the funds from my account i asked times and be confirmed the hotel was only taking for a deposit it s been days i m home and still no sign of my money
