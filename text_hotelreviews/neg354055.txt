our room was too far away from lobby low ceiling very noisey ear plugs were provided for that reason we were staying nights only and were offered a different room for the second night but found that just as much of a hassle to pack up again for one night there was no hour room service for food or drink for what is a star hotel that s very surprising we wouldn t recommend this hotel
