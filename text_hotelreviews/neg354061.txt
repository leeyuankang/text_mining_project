we stayed for nights but were given the smallest room on the floor walking around the furniture could only be done one person at a time also we had to pay extra for wifi in our room and even more for high speed wifi despite it being available all over the city for free i think the hotel scrambles the signal in the hotel so you can t get free wifi unless you sit in the lobby
