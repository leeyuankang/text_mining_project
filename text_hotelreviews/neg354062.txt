the layout of the hotel rooms when we first checked in we were given a room that requires us to get through a maze of corridors and taking elevator rides to different floors to get to the first room the first room size was excellent but we found getting to the room very very challenging in fact we thought the check in staff could have alerted us if we mind the walk thru that maze before giving us our keys if i were younger and have a family in tow i may still take that room but with my heavy luggage from travelling thru europe before arriving into amsterdam i wasn t in the mood to take that room we were than given another room that was still a long walk down the corridor to get there but at least it didn t require us to remember the maze that we need to walk thru to get our rest
