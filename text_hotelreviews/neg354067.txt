check in was a little difficult initially as the hotel asked for further proof of id drivers licence etc in addition to our passport id we had not been notified previously and did not have this to hand over we did not have any milk in the room during our night stay the hotel were unable to provide us with a final receipt of payment and stated this would be emailed due to problems with their computer however this has still not been sent
