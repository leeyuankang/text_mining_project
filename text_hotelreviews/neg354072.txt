only issues in what was overall a pleasant stay curtains in room don t fully meet therefore there is a light coming in from early morning through the window no hand towels left in the room on second night of stay had to call down the reception to ask them to drop up towels which reminds me it took ages to get through to reception as i have stated overall is was a pleasant stay but these above issues are fairly basic requirements that need to right all the time ps just thought of something else charging for wifi in rooms in this day and age is a complete rip off seriously
