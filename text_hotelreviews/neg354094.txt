when we checked into our room there were half consumed drinks left in the mini bar from the previous guests we had the ren room which includes a free mini bar we ask for our mini bar to be restocked every day unfortunately the staff never restocked the mini bar even after several requests per day we eventually got fed up with nothing being done that we stocked the mini bar ourself with items from the local shop
