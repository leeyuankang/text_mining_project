the rooms are not as modern and as smart as they look on the photos they look quite dated when you actually see them therefore i thought i was paying for a extra for fancier room and was disappointed also our air conditioning and tv didn t work plus we were originally checked into a room that had a lot of maintenance going on it in and no view so we had to wait to change rooms
