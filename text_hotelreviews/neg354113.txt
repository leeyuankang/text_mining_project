there was a power cut on the saturday evening of our stay this was really fustrating as a group of girls getting ready for an evening out for a birthday celebration with no electricity what so ever was almost impossible after sitting in our rooms for over an hour in the dark with no idea when the electricity would return we were forced to get ready in the dark using just the lights from our phones needless to say we most certainly didn t look not feel our best we checked out early the next day as had flights back upon check out there was no explanation apology or compensation i did not have time to address my disappointment as had to queue for quite some time to check out airport taxi was already waiting outside
