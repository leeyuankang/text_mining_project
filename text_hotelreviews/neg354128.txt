very disappointed i have stayed at the renaissance many times over the years period this year they put us on the second floor with our window next to the sidewalk where we were pleasantly surprised at the gentleman standing outside a window vomiting all over the ground and we could listen to every last drop period moving to a second room on the fourth floor we had the pleasure of listening to a metal gate slamming all night long worms word m avoid these rooms
