there was a misunderstanding about breakfast i signed up for the room which includes breakfast but when i went down in the morning they said it doesn t include breakfast luckily i had my booking printed out and showed the front office lady which states includes breakfast and they cleared the misunderstanding also the tv was broken for days with the red introduction screen from the hotel i mentioned it to the people in the lobby and allowed them to enter the room anytime because i was away anyway but when i came back it was still broken i got the twin beds which was a bit disappointing because i was checking in alone but since the hotel was fully booked i can understand
