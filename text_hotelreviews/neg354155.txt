not worth upgrading as larger room was odd in shape with about corners which is not my style and very dark with very poor view i did ask to move rooms but they said they had no other rooms available was disappointed the only response i got was that other people liked the room and found it quirky if it is common feedback about the room shape they should let people know as had i seen a picture of this room i would not have booked
