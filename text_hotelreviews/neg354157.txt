our room had no heating the bathroom windows were broken and the windows were so thin we couldn t sleep at all with all the noise the new years eve event was overpriced and overrated they didn t even have a countdown to midnight i also made the hotel aware that i am disabled and am using a wheelchair on and off yet the room they gave us had steps from the bathroom to the bed if this were a hotel i would be understanding but it cost a lot of money for a very poor hotel stay for us unfortunately if you want your money to be spent appropriately there are many other hotels cheaper and better
