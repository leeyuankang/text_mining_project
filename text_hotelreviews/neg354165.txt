this is my time staying in amsterdam and ive never had a bad hotel until now the reception area was lovely and that was about it as soon as we went up in the lift there was a funky smell and our room did not feel look or smell clean we went in a group of lads and all of us have come up in bites and are really itchy from staying here i didn t even put my bed shorts on and decided to sleep fully clothed the room service was disgusting and also charged for it to be delivered i ordered homemade chicken nuggets and they deliver some sort of slippery squid like stuff we were also then charged an extra euro on top of our booking fee for city tax that was not stated on the website when booking also charged at their own currency rate this hotel is also very over priced concidering how unclean it was definitely not a star and very over rated i will never be returning to this hotel and i would not recommend it to anyone
