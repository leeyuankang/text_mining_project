i stayed at this hotel last year and had a fantastic experience this time was different however it started with being told that we would have to pay extra for wi fi access i find this disgusting especially from a hotel of this class when i questioned this i was told its because we booked through booking com therefore implying that people are better off booking direct it got worse when we were taken to our rooms they were tiny dark and claustrophobic we stayed at this hotel last year and they were definitely not the same rooms again we were told this is because we booked through booking com we then decided to pay to get upgraded we were travelling with another couple so it was rooms that were being upgraded we were told one was ready but the other would need more time which was all fine as we moved all our luggage into the one room and said we would go out and pick our key up to the new room on our return when we did return we were told that nothing had been done as we had not confirmed our request even though we had relinquished our old room etc anyway the location is fantastic some of the rooms are great but if you want to go by the implications provided by their staff don t book through booking com as you will get an inferior service certainly not what i would expect from a hotel of this quality and class
