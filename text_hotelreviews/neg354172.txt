booking com is seen as third party to the hotel eventhough the high amount of revenue created through your bookings the room was advertised on your website as a twin deluxe room and the bed preference was put as two however this was not honoured by the hotel i do appreciate it is subject to availability however i do feel if a twin room is not able to be allocated then the guest should be informed and on the marriott website twin rooms were available and obviously they were allocated to more important guests then booking com it s is a shame as i am a returning guest to this hotel and it seems that when booking through booking com you are made to feel less important which should not be the case as many times your rate is higher or on par to the hotels rates
