stayed here after cycling at checkin was upgraded and told minibar was complimentary after that it became very disappointing the hotel is undergoing refurbishment of the bar restaurant as a result the hotel is completely dry the mini bar had only soft drinks in it and you cannot order any alcoholic beverages not great when you were after a celebratory beer room service is via an online system the hotel has arrangements to have food ordered in nothing is made onsite after ordering italian the minute guaranteed order time came and went after minutes reception agreed to chase the order up minutes later we were advised that due to inclement weather it would be a further hours wait not at all great at now sunday night breakfast was nice very hungry by this time albeit it was in a small cramped room with more low chairs and coffee tables rather than proper tables and chairs i presume another casualty of the refurb i suspect this is a nice hotel when fully operational but it was an expensive disappointment for us we were not aware of the refurb when booking via booking dot com if so we would have stopped elsewhere
