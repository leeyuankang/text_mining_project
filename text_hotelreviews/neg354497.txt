the hotel is decorated mainly black inside which is great for the dining and leisure areas but much too dark in the bedroom and bathroom couldn t see in the wardrobe very well and lighting for making up poor also there was a hair dryer provided but no mirror near a plug socket to see what you are doing i find this often in hotels and cannot understand why that is especially given the room rates continental breakfast was included which was fine but anything hot extra which again i think should all be included in the rate
