the interior is very dark tiles on the walls even in the bedroom area and therefore very masculine in its feel if you like that it s great for two women friends getting together a little more feminine softness would have been nicer the breakfast was very underwhelming and the wifi in our room was not functioning well enough to rely on it for the price we paid for an exceptional room it did not feel exceptional or special enough
