we only stayed one night and the one night we did they closed the bar to paint it so stuck homemade signs warning of wet paint around the bar and reception area consequently the small communal ground floor smelt of wet paint so we had to go out and go to the toren for a drink instead unacceptable to do maintenance during the day when guests are in residence they should do it at night so the chemical fumes and unsightliness of the painting is confined and didn t spoil the guest experience
