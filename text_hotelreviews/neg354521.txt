heat in hallways getting up to pent house it was sept at degrees f the room air conditioner didn t feel like it could always operate at full capacity we visited at an unusually hot time so that will seldom be an issue again i have a bad knee and my daughter has multiple scerolsis so it was concerning that there were stairs to our room even though the elevator took you a far part of it you have to deal with stairs to get inside the hotel up to the elevator or dining room and down two sets of stairs to the courtyard and up two small runs to get to the pent house far more steps than i had hoped for i had requested a room near the elevator and verified there was an elevator before reserving the room when they said yes it did not occur for me to still ask how many stairs we managed and loved our stay oh ice had to be obtained from the bar and we had a very small ice bucket if i did it over again i would have turned a waste basket into our ice bucket my daughter was really enjoying making her own iced drinks because it was so hot there was very little noise outside our window and the view of the canal couldn t have been more picturesque
