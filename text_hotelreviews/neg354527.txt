there was no air conditioning when i made the reservation and when i called the week before to confirm my reservation i asked if there was ac as i had read in some reviews that the ac sometimes did not work when i called i was told that some rooms did not have it but that mine definitely would when we arrived we got a shrug of the shoulders and the statement that the ac was not working since we were only staying for one night we stayed but that untruthful statement influenced our view of the canal house since they obviously did not give us accurate information fortunately the night was not particularly hot and the did give us a small fan
