service is not always what you would expect from such a high end hotel they don t go the extra mile to make sure you re a satisfied customer i felt like they didn t care that i was unhappy about my room we had to complain to different people before they admitted having an equivalent room they could mive us to also they first charged me extra for something we didn t take from the mini bar i had to insist we hadn t consumed anything and they made it clear that they doubted our word didn t apologize and finally gave me cash back because they couldn t return money to a debit card
