we booked a room for two adults and a four years old child arrived and were told at the reception we had to book a different room because the law does not allow a child to sleep with us what the room was changed without additional charges but i suspect they chose the worst room in the hotel instead it was the first floor windows had bars and practically no light inside outside was a dirty place with lots of garbage bottles wrappings and cigarette butts tons of them we decided not to have a look thru the windows as we were not going to stay in the hotel all time but after the first night we left it was really bad experience seemed the room was dirty and we felt uncomfortable then we waked up because of a smell of food it s likely some kitchen were under the room never again
