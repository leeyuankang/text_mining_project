we liked everything i would add that the stairs are steep being amsterdam but there is a lift if you need it we drove to the city and although there is some parking near the hotel it is extremely expensive and i would really advise against taking your car into the centre we parked in a park and ride on the outside and took tram in to westmarkt which is only a couple of minutes walk from the hotel
