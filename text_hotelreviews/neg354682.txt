hotel undergoing renovation without notice arrived after hour flight from australia little opportunity to relocate renovation noise above bedroom did not cease until about each night access via tiny lift requiring extra stairs to be negotiated with suitcases narrow corridor bedroom small shabby cluttered with outmoded and unnecessary furniture minimal storage nowhere to unpack or store suitcases need i go on i am amazed that this hotel has such apparently excellent ratings not borne out by our experience
