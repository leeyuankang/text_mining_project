the decor will enthrall some and turn off others though i am certain they were going for eclectic opulence it seemed odd walls of faux snake skin faux alligator faux corrugated steel and uniformly black paint were unique but simply not my style my wife found it less of an issue i may have been additionally put off by the light switch panel with a dozen plus buttons which frustrated me as i spent several minutes just trying to light the bathroom oh that was a seperate switch elsewhere why i was the one tasked with adjusting the lights is another discussion one of the nasa inspired switches scared the bejesus out of me when it made a string curtain close over a wall behind me why so there would be strings over the wall i guess this isn t a bad place to kick back after enjoying amsterdam but just not to my taste if you re there for the coffee houses it might be more to your liking i should say it was relatively affordable and if this is your bag baby go for it as another reviewer said the place is actually much darker than it appears in the photos
