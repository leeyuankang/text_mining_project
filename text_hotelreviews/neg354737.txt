didn t really appreciate the sight seeing tour of the hotel after a full day of travelling no room service room full of gadgets just wanted a kettle and a tea bag rather than a coffee pod and instructions of use unable to turn off the tv it was continually advertising viewing packages the room was compact which appeared to be dominated by the large screen tv which one could not turn off
