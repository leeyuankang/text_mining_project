after checking in i changed rooms with the one with bathtub but just noticed i left my purse to the previoius room with all of my credit cards and cash i contacted the front to ask him to check the guy said there s nothing but it was apparent he did not check exactly i asked him twice but he said guest was sleeping nor he checked in hours ago just after mins of my changing room so i decided to go by myself it was just meteres from my room and the guy just checked in the room was very friendly and handed me my purse the receptioninist just called up the gentleman in the room but he explained that he found the purse and handed me when i returned after seconds a phone at my room was ringing and ringing and the receptionist just said i said i would check for you why did you go i just do not understand his attitude but except this experience the overall staying there was good
