there was very little not to like about this place our fabulous room was in their annex building which is a few canal houses along from the main hotel this gave the feeling of returning to an exclusive apartment at the end of the day rather than to a fully tendered hotel some may feel a bit disappointed by this but to be fair this fact was very clearly and repeatedly pointed out and every stage in the booking process so we had no false expectations
