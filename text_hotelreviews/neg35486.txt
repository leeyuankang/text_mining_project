the price of the room declared on the website is not what you are going to pay i booked my room for two nights for and prepaid it online but really was charged about it turned out that the hotel before charging converted the eur amount at which i booked a room into the usd at a much higher exchange rate than the real one then they charged my eur bank account with an increased usd amount when i wrote to them asking to reimburse the difference they refused to do it apparently they consider that each customer is an idiot and will not notice that or they make you pay for the commission charged by their bank or payment system even though is too much of a charge it is not even for the money but the attitude which is astonishing never came across such a hotel in my country that would be called a fraud and would make a case for the police a customer should not be cheated like that i can only image how they fool people if they do it with everyone paying online really for a star hotel that charges per night that is a shame
