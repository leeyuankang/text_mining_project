i booked a double room in this star hotel as a treat to my wife we were then shunted to the new annex to a room that could have featured in any star hotel chain it had a pokey stairwell and looked dreadful when i enquiried about availability of other rooms it was obvious that per night did not buy me a room in the main hotel during my three day stay not one member of management spoke to me on check out i notice an item on my bill for euros this i found out was for having bacon with my breakfast which was included in my rate this hotel really needs to decide what it wants to be to charge for the room i had is immoral
