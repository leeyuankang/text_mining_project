as other reviewers have commented the breakfast was quite disappointing our main issue was the service staff were friendly but the service was very slow and lacklustre lots of orders were forgotten at various tables it was difficult to get the staff s attention we had no butter until we were finished with our breakfast coffee is served in very small cups that never seem to get refilled we saw thermos tea and coffee pots at other tables but we just had an empty one at ours the choice of the buffet breakfast was quite modest not really what one would expect from a star hotel
