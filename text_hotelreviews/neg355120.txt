the room was very small for similar price you can have definitely bigger room in andaz on the other side of the canal the breakfast experience was horrific we had to wait minutes for scrambled eggs and they were barely edible the breakfast choice was very poor there were a lot of waiting staff almost one per table but they seemed to have a very little interest in satisfaction of the guests i would say the same applied to all the stuff in the hotel again we stayed a few times in andaz and breakfast there was amazing with smiling non pretentious stuff i will not be staying in dylan again
