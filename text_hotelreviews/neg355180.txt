reception is so unobtrusive as to make the arrival process confusing and underwhelming paid nearly as much as i did at the renaissance across the road when last staying in the area and there is no comparison dus to the level of attention to detail for example my room had chipped paint a stained desk blotter similar hallmarks of a high volume room the st pancras renaissance allows no such things i m afraid that if i were staying in the area again and on a similar budget i d opt for the renaissance i d go to the gn bar again though
