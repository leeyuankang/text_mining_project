the main bar area was fitting in design with the hotel but the atmosphere didn t sync with the hotel s classy and elegant vibe the choice of music was clubby and was so loud that it made it impossible to hold an intimate conversation wouldn t stop me from staying at this hotel again but i d give the bar a miss and seek out other more intimate and cozy venues
