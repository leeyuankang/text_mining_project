the rooms were tiny i specifically upgraded to the slightly larger rooms on the top floor the issue is that the top floor has a slanted roof and the room is already tiny so it really feels like a room for hobbits the images of the rooms on the website are actually renderings so it s an inaccurate representation of the room also there wasn t really a view of anything except the roof of the train station for us which was a shame
