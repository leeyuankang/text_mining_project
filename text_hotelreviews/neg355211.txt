we went for brunch the next morning to the restaurant only to be told that we could sit in the bar or down stairs as they were fully booked we opted for the bar and stayed hour whilst we ate the restaurant during this whole time was only at half capacity that aside the food was amazing i highly recommend the crab and avocado on toast the best
