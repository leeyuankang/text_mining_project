the reception area is small and crowded for a hotel of this category we got a complementary upgrade to a bigger room this was sized as expected which means normal rooms must be small there is no proper walk in shower but a large bath tub instead with a shower but this is not a good solution as one can slip and water can go everywhere if you are close to the kitchen which we were there will be noise at night facilities are very basic it is not clear how they got five stars or what that implies for the difference between and stars we did not mind but it is not so clear how they can justify the price charged the breakfast is too expensive in particular as it is not at all difficult to get very good quality breakfast very close by so we did not book it
