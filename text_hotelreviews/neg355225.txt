we have stayed at the property previously and enjoyed our experience however the one item of disappointment is the cost usually you can expect to pay between gbp per night however on this occasion the property we assume as the stay crossed over valentines day was charging gbp which was an excessive uplift on arrival we went to our room which was a standard category to find that it was tiny the room only fit a double bed and bedside desk one side of the bed was against the wall and window so you would have to climb over your partner to get out of bed or to the bathroom and the foot of the bed was against the wall although they tried to romanticise the room as innovatively designed and reminiscent of old sleeper cabins it was far too small to be comfortable or functionable this meant changing rooms and paying an additional total to be able to walk around either side of the bed in a room that was of a standard hotel size very disappointing
