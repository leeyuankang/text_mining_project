entrance to the hotel is appallingly badly signed from the station or from the street i walked all around trying to figure out how to get in before entering via bar and asking then i was sent in right direction but mistakenly i went upstairs to restaurant rather than down to unsigned again hotel reception the street entrance needs a clear large sign on the awning saying hotel not a small metal sign on only one side of the entrance door saying hotel name after one has read name of the restaurant and given up door to lifts could be better signed inside too on the bedrooms floor
