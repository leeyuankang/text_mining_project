we booked a standard double room the room was very small but the bed even smaller it was only wide the room was so small that both persons had to get into the bed from the same side the bed was certainly too small for two standard persons when i told the reception the answer was that next time i had to book a superior room the very small bathroom was also very cold the heating in the bathroom was not working while it was freezing outside for all this we payed without breakfast never again
