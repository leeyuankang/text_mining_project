for a supposed star hotel the rooms are pokey and small i upgraded to a deluxe room which was only marginally larger than the tiny regular room no tea making facilities in room having a pantry on each floor is not convenient if you want a morning tea in bed no cupboards for clothes just an open hanger no desk in room hardly room to even walk around the bed for a hotel of this price it s exceptionally bad value for money i would not recommend and am highly unlikely to return
