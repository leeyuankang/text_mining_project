this time i booked a king room i was only there one night and was given a small double room the reception tried to tell me that this was a king size in the uk where i ve lived all my life and i do know what a king bed is found it a bit of a condescending excuse and as i was there only one night and tired i didn t escalate it but it did annoy me and probably won t go back due to this an apology would have been totally acceptable if they didn t have the room i booked available honesty is the best policy
