there was a lot of light from the outside which made it hard to sleep and very oddly a floor level light in the bathroom that we couldn t work out how to switch off the doors from the bathroom are glass so this was a bit of a problem the light was quite bright so make sure to take an eyeshade staff were helpful and friendly but seemed rushed and a bit short on help the room wasn t ready when i arrived at although i was given a free drink while i waited it also took some time for my bag to be brought up to the room this isn t what you expect from a hotel of that quality and price
