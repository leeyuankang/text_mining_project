the month of june and july the parking garage is closed there was no warning and we paid for it we got a rental car cause we thought we didn t have to worry about the crazy parking on the streets wrong we ended up parking and pulling a lot of heavy over a mile an half twice and was constantly stressed over the safety of the car
