went to have a meal at the plum and spilt milk in the hotel the food was nice however ordered a drink from the bar noticed the rim of the glass was chipped leaving a sharp edge flagged it up the waiter didn t seem to be concerned not a reaction i would have expected from an established restaurant not sure i m in a hurry to return for dinner there
