there was a misleading issue when checking in where they said my card was declined i had to use a different card once i had called the bank in the morning they said nothing was wrong with the card and nothing was declined so for a while i was under the impression i had been charged twice and resolving this issue could have been dealt with in a clearer matter by hotel staff
