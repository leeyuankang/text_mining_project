the room was abit small and cramped but i can understand that it is common here at such good location but both the bedside tables were really tiny with limited surface space to put personal items needed during sleep the lighting was dim while its romantic and good for some it s annoying when extra lighting was needed the wifi was unstable and hard to be connected i had to repeatedly log in while using it in the room and most of the time i had to use my own data roaming the reception was really helpful but there was nothing much they can do about the wifi
