the bathroom is only equipped with a bath no shower and thus it is somewhat tricky to have a quick shower the floor ends up very wet as there is no shower curtain but overall thats okay the noise from cars outside the hotel is isolated from all the station sounds announcements trains but our window was facing the road which was quite noisy even at night with all the buses
