unfortunately because the room was located on the floor near the door leading to the lifts it was very loud when shutting everytime someone came into the corridor i probably woke several times during the night because of this if the door shutting mechanism could be adjusted so it was quieter when closing it would make a big difference to anyone sleeping in the room
