not a bad experience just a little diasppointed i had not fully understood the size of the couchette room after all it does show a table and chairs on the webpage for the room so an assumption it would be snug but somewhere to sit at least no only on the bed and for two people even at a special price not really worth the money to be honest my husband was there with me and we danced around each other trying to get dressed and ready to go out a beautiful hotel but seriously these rooms should be sold to solo travellers
