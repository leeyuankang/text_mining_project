when i came to check in with the booking i had made they told me they didnt have a room they said booking com had sold me a room when the hotel was full the truth is that they sold my room for more money than i had paid due to high demand the two idiots on the tiny reception were clueless and couldnt care a toss they didnt try to help in any shape or form but the bar manager was fantastic much more professional in offering us a drink on the house even he remarked that my treatment was terrible
