others have already mentioned a couple of points and i heard another customer raising them when checking out too i think both need to be considered the bathroom has patterned glass in the doors as well as a gap where the two half doors almost meet in the centre as such the bathroom doesn t offer very much privacy sound or vision especially as rooms are quite small adding a curtain across would be a simple and valuable touch the hotel often has an event wedding held there this is fine and the hotel is very quiet however guests are not told until arrival that this means the bar and restaurant are closed to guests earlier than usual so you can t drink or eat there i understand why but we could and should be told earlier so other plans can be made
