rooms very tight athough perfectly kept and very nicely decorated the space was extremely small relative to the price being charged we had a cubitt room so one of the larger rooms and still had the toilet literally feet from the head of our bed this was our first stay in london so don t have much to compare to but for price of room would have expected larger footprint restaurant we were running late one morning and so decided to have breakfast in the plum and spilt milk onsite restaurant the total invoice for a breakfast for four and nothing extravagant was ordered regular eggs and bacon was a little over pounds the environments was nice but certainly not worth the extra lift on the invoice food was fine but value was not there for what we experienced and left a very bad taste in our mouths so to speak in terms of value overall so to sum up way too expensive for what was offered we have stayed in some very posh hotels in our travels and this one breakfast was one to remember for not the right reasons we chose to go elsewhere for the remainder of our stay
