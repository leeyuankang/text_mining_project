no air conditioning it was very warm during stay only had a fan in the room the room was booked for a special occasion daughter s graduation but given a room looking out onto tops of buildings would have been nice if it had overlooked the beautiful gardens it was one of the reasons i booked the hotel its location was ideal for greenwich uni as my elderly mum cannot walk very far
