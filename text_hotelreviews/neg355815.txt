room was over a party function room loud noise meant we had to request to be moved fortunately there was a spare room available and staff were helpful in moving us bit disappointed that although we have stayed many times at this hotel there is no recognition other hotels are much more on the ball and although i don t want to be best mates with the reception an acknowledgement would be nice
