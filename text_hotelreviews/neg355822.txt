we were put in a disabled room which i couldn t understand why as this wasn t pre booked the bathroom wasn t very inviting and had an uneven tiled floor which i felt was unsafe for bare feet there was mould in the grouting and on the tiled floor we couldn t sleep at all as our room looked out onto the generator which kept us awake all night as it was so loud this was particularly annoying considering i had a six hour drive the following day the corridor leading to our room was extremely dirty and tired looking and didn t give a very good first impression when you got out of the lift overall we were very disappointed and because of that we wouldnt return
