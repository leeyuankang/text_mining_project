bar staff not good in serving people in the right order we were two ladies waiting to be served but had to wait around minutes people were coming in and getting attended to before us not happy about that only one person serving the evening we were there plus one who didn t seem to be doing anything need to sort this out or customers will go elsewhere to have a drink
