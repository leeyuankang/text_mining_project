the standard evening meal was disappointing we both wanted smoked salmon starter and it was off i had goats cheese but it was not hot and creamy my friend had tempura prawns with no side salad or bread my main of chicken curry was just curry and rice no chutney poppadums naan or anything very ordinary the tortellini again was mediocre breakfasts were fine
