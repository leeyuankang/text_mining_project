the sink in the bathroom didnt work and although we reported it straight away it was not resolved during our stay and was extremely inconvenient unfortunately because we had not booked directly with the hotel but booking com the manager was unable to offer a refund on the bill only a discount voucher on our next visit as that is unlikely we received no recompense for the inconvenience experienced
