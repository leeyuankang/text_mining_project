understaffed bar in the evening the poor bartender ricardo was left to serve over wedding guests by himself the guy had a great attitude though and was a credit to the hotel just a shame it took over minutes for some of the supervisors to come and assist him only once he d run out of glasses and draught beer bar prices are very high for a pint of beer and a medium white wine is steep even by london prices it s a de vere not the savoy and when you consider it was understaffed too it was disappointing staff were rushed off their feet at breakfast and we had to wait a long time just to get a tea coffee
