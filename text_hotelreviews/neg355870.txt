tiles around bath tub were crumbling and in need of replacement room was the smallest and most cramped i ve ever experienced at the devonport not enough room to position the guest chair so that tv could be viewed very sad that the devonport does not have rooms to accommodate all my relatives and myself for my son s wedding this june so have had to book my family group into the ibis rather than being able to introduce the positive devonport experience to relatives
