having to pay gor car park price should include parking as we were guests of the hotel it is an extra cost and would be an extra incentive to chose the hotel if free parking was included we had a nice room but we were not told that it was directly over a wedding disco maybe reserving the room for wedding guests would have been appropriate however this did not spoil our overall stay for the days
