we had a twin room and the beds had casters on unfortunately the beds were only held in place by gravity hence if you sat up in bed and put your back on the headboard the bed rolled across the room good fun but not practical although it did give us a few laughs tip if you intend to read in bed put the lounge chair at the bottom of the bed problem solved
