beds were very small narrow very high and very uncomfortable got no decent sleep for nights and woke up every hours due to the awful beds went home for a rest bill was overstated and i was charged for room service i did not order items on bill made no sense and were unrelated to what i ordered very misleading hotel had a cold and uncaring atmosphere residents were subjected to hours of tv sport on saturday and there was also sport on the radio at the bar yards away playing in counter harmony to that on the tv awful there was hardly ever anyone on the bar to provide drinks or information to guests and you had to go looking for someone each time you wanted something
