we had requested early arrival times and a cot for one of our rooms however we arrived later than planned but the rooms still weren t ready and that was after checking with booking com that everything would be ready the cot was in extremely poor condition and too dangerous for us to put our grandson in we reported the fact to the desk but nothing was done about it we are waiting to hear from management about that issue the shower areas could do with a anti mould and mildew remover in our room anyway there needs to be a sign post directing you to the car park at the rear of the hotel as it took a bit of searching for that s not really a complaint
