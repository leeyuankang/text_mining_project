being in the heart of greenwich i suspect that this wonderful building is grade listed this means that the windows are single glazed and on occasions there can be traffic noise in the rooms that face the main road it s worth remembering that parking is extra in this day and age it is fairly normal for better hotels to have rooms fitted with safes but not here some of the rooms have been updated and i suggest that you ask for one of these if you intend to visit
