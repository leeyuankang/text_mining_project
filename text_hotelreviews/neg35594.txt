the odor in the hallway and the room was terrible it was like staying in a smoking room although the staff said it s a non smoking hotel i bought an freshener but it didn t help the odor was too strong i should have chosen a slightly expensive hotel than la bourdonnais won t stay again and won t recommend unless you mind the odor
