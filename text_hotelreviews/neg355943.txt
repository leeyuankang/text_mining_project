the rooms were basic and in desperate need of decoration extremely dark and dowdy and sparsely furnished with what looked like odd hand furniture there was mould in the grouting of the tiles in the bathroom and ingrained dirt and staining around the edges of the bathroom floor it was superficially clean we had been upgraded to a superior room when we arrived i dread to think what our original room would have been like the windows were single glazed and did not fit well therefore the traffic disturbed our night it certainly wasn t four star standard and not worth the money we have stayed in better budget hotels which are cheaper we are not normally picky but we were very disappointed and would not stay there again or recommend it
