i think for the price breakfast could have been included also the tray in the room could have included a bottle of water and perhaps some biscuits like most other places nowadays we got back to the hotel at twenty past midnight and wanted drinking water we asked at reception if we could get a bottle to be told it cost and they would have to charge room service on the plus side we were told that there was a water dispenser on one of the floors that was free so was all good in the end we were in room which had a generator or something outside the window so was a little bit noisy with the windows closed it was ok but wouldn t be so good in the summer
