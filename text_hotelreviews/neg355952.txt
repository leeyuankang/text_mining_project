the towels were rough and there wasn t any robes which i like to pop on after having a bath and then getting ready to go out for the evening the windows were a little drafty and the radiator was making a funny noise but had to have it on as the temp outside was freezing and the tea and coffee facilities were milk each and that s it so wasn t able to have more than and when you come in freezing after walking around the markets you need a nice hot drink and then another one in the morning
