the bathtub and shower had mould in the corners some tiles were cracked on the floor and had grouting missing the duvet cover had makeup stains on and the mugs spoons for free tea and coffee were stained too the free wifi was so slow that s when either of us could connect at all overall disappointed considering the star rating and the amount of money paid at least they had free sweets at the front desk
