asked for a twin room which we received but it was designed for wheelchair user which we are not so basin in bathroom was too low such a person would have found it difficult to get in to the bath with shower overhead even though there were some grab bars and it felt very dicey have previously eaten in the restaurant which had a good menu at one time now reduced to set menu with three poor choices although we were able to have the bar menu ok but basic there was no one else in the restaurant at on a saturday which says it all really breakfast was fine though on the expensive side if not included in the room rate at nearly per head ok if you want a big blowout i suppose overall it feels like de vere are trying to cut costs at this hotel i was alarmed by some powder put down in our corridor before we left looks like some kind of infestation had broken out
