sadly the property was severely let down by the fact that the rooms and bedroom hallways were like saunas no air con the windows barely opened this led to a very poor nights sleep made worse by our room being overrun with wasps whom were trying to attack the sluggish dying bees from the hives on the ground below the livestock is natural and nothing can be done about it but despite the provision of a room fan which sadly just blew the boiling hot air around if there had been air con units you would not have had to open the windows which let the wasps in the provision of a fridge would have been helpful too so if you wanted to you could take a cooling drink sadly this was not provided and rendered you having to drink very warm water in the middle of the night i would not recommend staying here in the height of summer as a consequence to get dressed for a wedding or function would be horrendous as you d be sweating so badly as a consequence i d definitely recommend this place as a mid winter hotel
