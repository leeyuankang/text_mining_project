the room was an adequate size but the window didn t open very much and it was very hot with no air conditioning they must realise this as at least there was a fan in the wardrobe not enough electrical sockets for this day and age when phones laptops etc need charging if you do stay there here s a small tip when you park go into the hotel reception to sort out your parking as the parking charge may be included in your room rate also hotel reception isn t easily found and badly signed go into the entrance that is marked devonport house conference centre
