what i didn t like was the location of my room interestingly enough when i open my nice wide room window i was looking directly to a grave a cemetery just outside the window the least they could do was ask us if we don t mind having a grave site as a view i was thinking the front desk staff didn t like us and purposely did it as a surprise not nice i was not able to sleep well that night
