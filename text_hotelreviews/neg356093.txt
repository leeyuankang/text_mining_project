male receptionist his rude and arrogant manner on our arrival was only redeemed later by the other staff who were most helpful especially the young lady who sorted out a problem with the parking charges which had already been agreed on our booking we personally escort and arrange tours for clients from many parts of the world and pride ourselves on good interpersonal skills i gave him warning that his manner was offensive and inflammatory but he really didn t have a clue in spite of this he really couldn t have cared less and probably never will i would certainly not employ him maybe in the kitchen washing the dishes it left a nasty taste in our mouths which made us feel critical and disatisfied with the wholeplace it was not until the young lady came up to our room resolved everything and gave an apology did we start enjoying ourselves as we were having a short holiday ourselves prior to picking up clients please send him to charm school or let him go he will do nothing for your business
