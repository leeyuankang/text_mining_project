almost everything there was no air conditioning and the windows only opened about the room and furnishings were old and worn the bed was hard and not conducive to good sleep the breakfast was pretty awful served as a buffet that was not replenished as often as needed choice of breads were mostly tasteless white bread and rolls room did not have an alarm clock so i had to depend on wake up calls which didn t always come far too many problems for the cost and the star rating
