black mould in the bathroom the bathroom facilities were quite dated and needed to be refurbished with quite a lot of dirt between the tiles disappointed with the lack of cleanliness of the bathroom for a four star hotel the view from our window was a graveyard which although is not the worst thing in the world i would expect a bit a clarity that was a possibility when booking your stay our major gripe was the poor service provided by the reception staff who were generally not helpful had absolutely no common sense and could not comprehend the concept of good communication or customer service the s standard response that was given to everybody with a request or a complaint was i will have to ask the manager after taking payment upon our arrival which we assumed was payment for our accommodation we were informed on check out this was in fact not the required payment for the room and we had to make another payment for the room the receptionist decide to cancel my previous transaction and request full payment rather than charge me the outstanding due to this i am currently unable to access to the initial payment of as it is still allocated or within a shadow by my credit card provider overall we were generally disappointed with our stay
