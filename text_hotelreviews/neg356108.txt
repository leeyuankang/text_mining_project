we booked rooms the rooms are very dated and need modernising we asked for a cot in one room and an extra bed in each of the other rooms the cot was there when we arrived but there were no extra beds in the other rooms we had to contact reception and request the two beds when we returned much later on the evening only one bed had been delivered so it was an uncomfortable nights sleep as there was three in the one bed
