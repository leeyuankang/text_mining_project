check in was quick and easy the first room we were allocated was a real disappointment bathroom floor tiles were cracked and uneven fan didn t work and generally the room was tired and in need of refurbishment second room was better although i still think the hotel is overdue a refurb breakfast was lovely great selection from the buffet friendly staff we had it included in our package but quite expensive if you didn t booked in for the special pre marathon pasta buffet the evening before the race and were bitterly disappointed no buffet just a menu of three choices waited almost mins one dish was not at all as ordered ended up not paying for any of it think the fact that they had a wedding in the hotel impacted on staff availability in the restaurant added hugely to the stress the night before the marathon managers v apologetic not just us who had problems that night virtually everyone in the restaurant did moral don t advertise a special putting flyers in rooms to encourage take up if you can t deliver
