considering i ve lived for many years in london slightly shabby rooms were expected definitely not a rather a good bathroom floor tiles broken low cost amenities installed so everything feels quite cheap fragile shower dripping protection bedroom bed ber uncomfortable soft like an inflatable dinghy the kids extra bed looked felt like it was used in one flew over the cuckoo s nest no air conditioning the bedroom was hot as at adriatic in the summer the walls the doors have to be made from plaster as you can hear people walking way away even from the other hallway
