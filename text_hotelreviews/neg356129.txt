excellent location but i agree with other reviews that the hotel is a bit tatty in places and could do with a refurb and the price does not reflect this bar and restaurant prices quite expensive but i expected this in london i stayed there as i was doing the london marathon and was hoping for an early night on the saturday however there was a wedding reception taking place and the disco was incredibly loud this did spoil my stay so if you are looking for a peaceful location check first whether there are any functions booked
