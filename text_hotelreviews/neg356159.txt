hotel is generally well kept and clean but some aspects of the decorations and finishes in the bedrooms particularly the floor and wall tiling in the e suites need some attention windows are not all well maintained and are not easy to open and close and let night sound in depending on what side of hotel you are sleeping i appreciate that this building might be a listed building and the windows cannot be changed due to planning restrictions which can only be expected in such a location mattresses a little hard but may be ok for some
