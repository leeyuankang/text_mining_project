the bathroom smelt strongly of damp and had black mould in several places had to keep the door shut to the bathroom because of the smell we did report the problem to reception when we booked out the next day yes we should have done it as soon as we realised there was a problem but as it was my birthday i did not want to waste time complaining at reception and moving rooms it is a problem that a guest at a de vere hotel should not be having in the first place
