the room was a nice cosy size for a double bed but we booked a twin room i was staying with my mum and so it wasn t really big enough accommodate twin beds other reviewers have pointed this out too basically single beds are pushed together with no space between them this was actually ok for us but i imagine some guests wouldn t like it also my mum is very short and has restricted mobility so struggled to actually get in her bed i didn t have any problems tho and loved how high and comfy my bed was
