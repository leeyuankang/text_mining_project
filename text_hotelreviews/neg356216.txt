i made at least three phone calls for room service i was told that somebody would call me back but to no avail either a management failure for understaffing or of an individual i feel there is no excuse it wasn t it was in contrast to many other hotels where i had to stay at during that season and where i really fell welcome as soon as i stepped in this one really fell very short on that front i was going to extend my stay only for one night but i preferred to sleep elsewhere without necesarily paying more lovely buildihg absolutely amazing location but unfortunately they haven t caught up with the times
