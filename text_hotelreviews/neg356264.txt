was looking forward to the full english breakfast in the morning but while the fry itself was nicely cooked it was cold very disappointing as i was down first thing and expected a warm breakfast the lack of information both in the lobby room was a annoying as i had to phone down to reception a few times the thump thump of music from the bar meant i didn t sleep well
