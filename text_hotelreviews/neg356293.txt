the hotel is very big and a little impersonal unfortunately one of the beds in our room still had bedding on it from the previous occupant we didn t find this out until we were ready to retire so had to get dressed to wait for housekeeping the girl who came was very apologetic but could not explain how this could happen the other bed was fine no comment was made when we checked out next morning obviously no communication between departments and no further apology not good customer service
