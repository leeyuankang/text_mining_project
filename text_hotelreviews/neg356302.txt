i was very disappointed in the location of the room despite requesting a quiet room because we are both in our it was very noisy on saturday evening the shower door did not close resulting in water being spilled onto the bathroom floor a health and safety issue strangely we were asked to pay on arrival our room card keys continually refused to work no we did not keep them near to mobile telephones or bank cards
