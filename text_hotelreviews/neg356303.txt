well i choose this venue as it was a birthday present for my friend as her son had bought tickets to see neal diamond and to be honest seeing the venue on line and the comments thought this would be perfect for her was not impressed when arriving there was an issue regards payment on booking then when we entered the room very disappointed two holes in one of lamps bathroom had mildew on the tiles and surroundings on the floor the bin in the bathroom had no liner and was dirty inside the window facing one of the beds would not shut so all we heard was a generator all night as this was broke on the advice of a duty manager coming to look but as it was sunday no maintenance to fix the air vent in bathroom was broken the valance on my bed was stained at the bottom i have taken photo s regards the issues with the room then when leaving was told had to pay for disability parking which was not explained on arrival the receptionist asked for our car registration but we thought this was just checking what cars go with guests we were not told this was for payment cannot blame receptionist as apparently she was new and still training but no one with her to supervise kind regards patricia finan
