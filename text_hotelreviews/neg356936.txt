wifi was slow and highly unstable to connect to this you ll also need to fill an on screen form with your details which is absolutely not user friendly on a phone screen and why would they need these details anyway they got the same data on record when checking me in so why punish me for connecting to the wifi by making me fill that form moreover lack of wifi data encryption anybody across the street can sniff your passwords
