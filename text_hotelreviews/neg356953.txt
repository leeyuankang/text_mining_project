the room was comfortable but a little small by european standards it was probably acceptable the bed was comfortable which means a lot to me when traveling the maids did clean the room daily and that is a plus with me the hotel restaurant only opened for breakfast although the bar offered limited fare i did find numerous small restaurants close to the hotel and by and large the prices were reasonable i must have missed the prepaid breakfast option but the hotel only charged eur for breakfast which was reasonable
