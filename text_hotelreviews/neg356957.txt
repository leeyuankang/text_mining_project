don t rely on getting a twin room despite requesting a twin room months in advance we were put in a double not ideal as i was travelling with my mother when we complained the staff were not apologetic and didn t offer anything to make up for it we really weren t impressed additionally the air conditioning didn t seem to work and the room was really hot
