this is not a hotel at best the room was exceptionally small glad i didn t bring a cat one pillow each and the towels are past there best although it was degrees air conditioning is only available in the summer so the small room became a furnace at night if you opened the window a lot of noise was generate by the smoking room until late at night they supplied toiletries on the first night not replaced and no complimentary water which is usually supplied in hotels the reception and bar area were really nice and the rooms were rather disappointing the bathroom was tiny and in need of some tlc the price was ok for city centre probably wouldn t stay here again
