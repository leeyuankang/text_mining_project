the wifi was the worst i ever came across and i had my share of hotels it kept indicating a good signal but if my ipad would connect at all most of the times kept on trying to do so the connection will be lost again within a minute or so this not only made it absolutely impossible to work in my room but was also getting frustrated for that reason i would not recommend this hotel for business travelers another problem was the soundproofing in my room my windows were just above the tram line which kept rattling them all through the night finally free access to the wellness suite was included but the door lock was broken i assume and would not accept my key card on all occasions i wanted to use it i had to get downstairs to the reception in my robe and ask for an attendant to come and let me in when you have only a limited time window to relax in between work and dinner with business partners having to do all the extra exercise was not ideal
