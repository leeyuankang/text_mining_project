the air conditioning broke down the third night and never worked properly afterwards i asked reception to check into this but it really wasn t followed up and on the last day night we had no aircon we were provided with a fan but we should have been moved to another room as a result we were given a discount for the last night and an apology unfortunately it was very hot in vienna and the room became uncomfortably hot
