almost everything other than few staff member i will not recommend this hotel to anyone not sure why is it rated as stars instead of to stars we were given a horrible room with foul smell at this hotel and front office staff few people are very rude we complained multiple times to get the room changed even though earlier guests also complained about same issue manager is not interested to close down the room it should be reported to health ministry to check this hotel s when we called front office guy he was so rude and was asking us to open the windows for the smell breakfast is very average with not many options especially for vegetarians
