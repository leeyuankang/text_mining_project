my daughter s only complaint was that they didn t provide shower caps the location in the museums quartier was nice and quiet but it was a bit of a hike at the end of an evening out in the centre of town to get back to the hotel maybe about minutes it didn t matter if the weather was nice but on our first evening which was quite chilly and windy it was a battle to walk back after dinner still there was a train station nearby that we didn t take advantage of until our last couple of days
