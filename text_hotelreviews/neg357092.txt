room was ok but a little small no air con available in the room or the rest of the hotel when the breakfast room was full of people it was hot and stuffy no air con in the postage stamp of a gym was ridiculous was told it is controlled centrally some staff were lovely particularly one set of breakfast staff unfortunately the other set were rude scowling looking at their watches when we went into breakfast hour before the end ignoring their tables and not serving hot drinks unplugging the toaster and heated trays for the cooked food and not replenishing the buffet also they shortened the hours for breakfast by putting up a sign in front of the restaurant but the desk staff and in room information didn t have the shortened hours leading to confusion and further rudeness
