it was late march but the hotel and the room were very hot and we were unable to cool it down even with window open it was hot they have electronic room keys which are thick encased in plastic but you can only get one per room as only one key can be programmed this was a problem if the two of us were doing different things one day i took a nap after a sauna while my wife continued to work out so to avoid being woken up i had to leave the door slightly ajar so she could get in as i had the only key with me a minor but occasionally annoying issue
