the staff at the reception did not welcome us nor tried to provide any extra help information the breakfast buffet was very poor especially in sweets while you would expect a great variety in chocolate sweets due to vienna s tradition one day we were treated in a very rude manner by one staff member at the breakfast it was in the morning we had filled our plates and were about to sit to a table suddenly a lady started shouting at me in german not to sit there i asked in english what was wrong and she said tha this table was set for lunch i chose another table and she started shouting again for the same reason almost all tables were full so there werenot many choices i dont understand why the tables must be reserved for lunch so early and why the lady did not show us a free table instead of shouting
