the only thing we thoroughly hated were the bathrooms no doors between overall bed and bathing areas and only a clear glass door to shower and separate toilet that is zero privacy if this were different we would definitely recommend this hotel and come back again in the end however and for the price we paid sorry it s a dealbreaker
