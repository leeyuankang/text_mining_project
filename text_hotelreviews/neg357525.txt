though small he hotel has a bit of an odd and sprawing layout our rooms were far down a series of labyrinthine halls separated by heavy fire doors while our suite was large bright and pleasant the extra double room we booked was quite dark opening onto a lite shaft with no other window and so small it barely accommodated more than our bed
