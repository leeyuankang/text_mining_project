we were not that happy with the deluxe double room we received since it had no view and we were not comfortable with having the toilet and bath set within the room and merely separated by glass walls and therefore not ensuring the proper intimacy we are not that avantgarde maybe other customers are ok instead by luck we happened to see the opposite room that was cosy and what we were looking for and available and we moved into it although it was a classic double room and not a deluxe therefore we had a very good and comfortable stay otherwise we would not have been happy
