only slight downside was we were in a room for four adults and although the room was lovely as was the bathroom the bathroom door was opaque for the central section with clear glass top and bottom offering the rest of the room a view of your legs and feet whilst using the toilet area surrounding the hotel on first impression looked rather suspect and indeed it was rather run down but as it was only a short walk to the metro this didnt prove to be a problem
