i stayed at the first floor where some renovation works were going on actually i was hoping to have a renovated room but when i compared with the pictures at booking com my room seemed to be old fashioned and not so fresh so be careful what type of room you book water was coming out every time i had a shower i found wifi not to be stable enough many interruptions as working at nights again another hotel with no ventilation at all at breakfast room so be prepared that your suit will smell the whole day bacon and eggs
