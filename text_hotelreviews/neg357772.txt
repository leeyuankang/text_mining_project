the air conditioning in both rooms we had two made a horrible vibrating squeaking noise on and off all the time when it was turned off this disturbed our sleep the hotel looked into it and admitted it was a problem in other rooms too but they couldn t fix it they gave us a discount they should really take those rooms out of service until they sort the problem
