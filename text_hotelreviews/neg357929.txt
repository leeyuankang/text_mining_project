paid for the queen superior room which was very small not worth the money i took a shower the second day of my stay and the carpet outside the glass became damp and smelly when i approached the staff about this problem they said it was the toilet over flowing they relocated me to a generic room with no compensation for the hassle the second room was uncomfortable and i did not enjoy my last stay at this hotel other than that the overall stay was perfect the area was relaxing and central to everything
