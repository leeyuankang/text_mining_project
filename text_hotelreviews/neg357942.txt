i am afraid my room was not star quality as of my slatted blinds was damaged and too much light was able to come through the kettle was tatty there were some scuff marks on the walls the base of the bed had scuff marks too the view from the side window was of the roof with bits of broken concrete i really felt the room was star at a push the only full length mirror was inside the wardrobe and the door would not stay open so was alomost impossible to use the mirror i was very dissapointed with my room
