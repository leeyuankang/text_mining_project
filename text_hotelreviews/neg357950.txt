the bathroom no privacy at all the bathroom is part of the room it is made of glass walls and everything is visible trough them there is space between the glass doors and the ceiling so not quite a bathroom the owners should definitely fix this problem the canal smell in the room that was a problem as the only reversible window could not be fully opened the breakfast has no variety the omlette is tasteless same menu every morning i would not choose the breakfast next time especially that it s very easy to get to a nearby restaurant not worth it the price is too high for the services not quite star services
