our room was difficult to reach from the lobby we needed to go down the stairs and take a lift just to arrive on the same level as reception there was no direct lift walking access to the same floor so having several luggage pieces it was not easy breakfast just one objection the chocolate cream was really not tasty at least for nutella lovers
