the amount i paid for the room at this hotel was daylight robbery and yes i am taking account of the fact it was easter has i have paid half of what i did it would still have been expensive for what i got but more realistic the room had a see through bathroom which is apparently the hotels concept i queried why this wasn t mentioned on the website but they said they can t as people wouldn t stay as no body likes it they had a limited amount of rooms without that type of bathroom but unfortunately we weren t first in the q to be moved the worst part about this bathroom was the drain mildew smell that filled the whole room the room was also incredibly dark the only main light was in the bathroom meaning very little light in the actual room
