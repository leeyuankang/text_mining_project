being given a tiny single room for oaps which they called an executive room it was furnished with a large bed against one wall one would have had to crawl over to get into bed just enough space to pass on the other side shocking requested a quiet room after complaint we were given a slightly bigger room comment definitely not park plaza standard a really big disappointment and certainly not value for money
