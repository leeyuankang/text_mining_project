didn t like the bathroom it was made of glass so you could see the person using the toilet on checkin reception asked us if we wanted to have our towels changed every day or if we would make do with the one set they gave us to be eco friendly also we agreed to donate euro to some charity instead of having our room serviced every day we were told that at any time we could have fresh towels just ask anyone at reception this was not the case at all we were there for nights and never had our room serviced at all we got no towels changed no toilet paper no bins emptied the room was a mess as there s nowhere to put anything no shelves in bathroom for ur towels so we had to leave them on bedroom floor we twice asked at reception for our room to be serviced but they didn t do it when we were leaving we complained to them about this and they did nothing we were disgusted i would never stay here again the reception staff don t seem to communicate with the rest of the staff and no matter what we asked them they didn t know they look confused all the time also the breakfast was very limited which is not how the hotel sells themselves our room was outside the hotel in another building which was a annoying as it was raining every day and we had to wear our coats to breakfast every morning another thing they don t tell you
