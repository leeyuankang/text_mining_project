the room we booked was not available but we were then apparently upgraded to an executive suite small room dirty carpets and on floor with faulty lift nothing like the pictures on booking com website general cleanliness not up to standard but was handled appropriately from pro perspective bike rental expensive should be offered to customers as a service not for profit breakfast good but minimal variety and after days difficult to enjoy
