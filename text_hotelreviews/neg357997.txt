on arrival we were given the smallest room in the hotel as said by a member of staff despite paying and questioning the queen superior room we had booked and paid for the furniture was old and worn the bathroom barely fitted one person and there was a dead fly on the bed sheets we then had to call reception and explain our problem to which the response was oh yes you have the smallest room in the hotel but i can show you others so we had to take our own luggage back down to reception and wait to be accommodated to a room we should ve been given straight away we weren t compensated for any of this
