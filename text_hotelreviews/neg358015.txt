well firstly when we checked in they didn t have the room we had booked which was a queen size double bed room instead we were given a very grotty very small twin room their excuse well they said booking though booking com are only suggestions not guarantees but they did have nicer rooms that we could pay extra for surprise surprise after complaining the room really was very poor and not what we paid for they changed us on the second day of stay to the room we had booked a queen size double bed room which was nice and we then thought happy days nevermind about first day mistakes happen that was until we got the bill they charged us over more for the stay that what was agreed when i booked the room in short we didn t get the quality of room we d booked and on top of that they charged us a lot more for it than the price quoted when booking in fact it cost more than if i d just walked off the street and got a room i ll never stay there again and i would recommend others not to either
