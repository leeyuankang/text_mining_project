our room it was scandalous i saw so many fantastic rooms online that were metres squared and we were so disappointed to be wedged into a room we clearly did not book or pay for there was no picture on the website of such a poor room the bed is squashed into the corner so you can only get out on one side which is inches from a bathroom door so standing up is awkward there is just enough room below the bed for a table chair and your bags to not be hit by the door being opened i had booked two rooms and the other couple were given a room that was tunneled to another building a few metres away we went to see if they were okay with theirs as well and it was enormous it was the exact thing we came to expect only that we did not get such a beautiful room further i had ordered a drink at the bar for my girlfriend a gin and tonic which later i found out on the bill was i was given no prior warning to how expensive it would be residents bars at fancy hotels usually are more expensive but it was labelled as an open cocktail while it looked fantastic nobody asked him to arrange a fantastic looking display when lets be honest what we wanted was basic alcohol and merryness his saving grace was his quintessential politeness and professionalism we did feel aristocratic placement now i have been to amsterdam a few times so i know my way around this hotel is a bit away from the city centre we walked from the train station to the hotel in about an hour at a leisurely pace so my friends could see the city the trams do bring you to dam square city centre however if you are a bit apprehensive travelling on the trams always using maps maybe get somewhere closer you can pay for day passes approx day passes and weekly passes that can be used for the damrak trams and buses to get to anywhere in the city
