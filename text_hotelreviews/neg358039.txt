room was smelly you could smell sewerage from our room and we had the last room available the staff were lovely about it but it wasnt a cheap hotel the location was really far from the main center but in a residential area so nice and quiet definitely not stars in my standards the room was tired and the dust was really bad probably stayed in a cleaner travelodge was just ok
