booked an executive king room but when walking into our room on arrival we saw we had two double beds pushed together but with separate bedding went to reception to see if we could change but turned out their executive king rooms were fully booked and they had upgraded us to a business suite but with two single beds we were told to come back the following morning to see if any more rooms were available went back to reception in the morning to inquire and were told that we could upgrade our room to one with a king sized bed for an extra euros a night not wanting to kick up a fuss and part with our money we thought we d just make do with existing room especially as we were only there for a couple of nights despite the bed issue our room was great it was huge and had everything we needed just a little annoying that we didn t get what was originally booked especially as we were paying good money
