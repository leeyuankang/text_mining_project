for a hotel i expected them to have more travel adopters or tell me honestly they didn t have any instead of asking me to ask everyday without the staff prompting me themselves they took over an hour for them to bring an iron up which had made me late the staff also could of mentioned that the room we upgraded at our stay was next to building works i could hear work going on every morning and the fact i had paid more to upgrade was a joke
