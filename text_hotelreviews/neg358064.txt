the hotel needs a major overhaul the rooms are outdated dark not enough lights carpet dirty bathroom not practical the interesting part is that most reviews have the same complaints for the past years and the management does not seem to care to improve this place so based on thiese facts i will not come back and suggest others to do the same and spend your money on better places
