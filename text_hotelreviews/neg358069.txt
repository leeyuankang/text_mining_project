we booked a superior double room and got a tiny twin room the hotel s supervisor didn t even have the mood to do something when we insisted he just asked euros additional charge per day so rooms were available but they just wanted to get rid off the tiny ones the hotel is definitely not a star hotel apart from that there was so much noise from the corridors the doors were hitting like if they were next to you head we would wake up at every morning because of the doors the cleaning stuff was making so much noise as well we could here them talking and hitting doors finally i will say it one more time take care the rooms are tiny and the supervisor is rude
