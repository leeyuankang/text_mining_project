we made an order at the vondelpark branch of the hotel our reservation was for executive rooms with a connecting door and it was confirmed to us by the hotel via booking com prior to our arrival upon arrival we have discovered that the hotel does not have such rooms after no other alternative was available we have agreed not to completely ruin our vacation to take a suite at the victoria hotel at the city center needless to say this had significantly negative impacted our vacation stepping out to the vondelpark area is a lot different than stepping out to damrak street especially with a child with a disability for which the vondelpark location was chosen to begin with
