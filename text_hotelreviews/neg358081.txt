the room was very disapointing we expected to see a very nice room like the pictures but nothing match it was very old dated the window didn t closed well the bidet was broken the carpet looked very old and dirty corners in the bathroom very dirty the lamps full of dust the duvet cover had a strange smell the little fridge in the room didn t work at all and it was extremily noise we could hear the conversation of other guests on the corridor at any time and all the steps from the room above us plus the continuous tram with poor window isolation and because of that we were not able to sleep well the location its ok easy to go from one place to another with the tram but still there isn t much around unfortunately the hotel pictures you can see at booking com or the hotel web is not the reality for the bedrooms
