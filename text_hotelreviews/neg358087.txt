the rooms with the bathrooms in slightly weird i think it s why our first room smelled weird a wet room that s not properly a wet room as the only surround is a frosted glass which is ok if your a couple but if your sharing with friends that frosting covers nothing and yes we are friends but that does nt mean we need to hear each other on the toilet slightly awkward and meant one of us would use the toilet and the other would go downstairs carpets need updating showing signs of wear
