we specifically ordered in advance a twin room traveled with my nephew yet when we arrived we were allocated to a double room the staff brought in an extra bed and we were promised to change to a twin room on the following day we ended up staying in the double room though because it had a double balcony some of the items tea coffee creamer glasses and some of the towels were not replaced on a daily basis i would probably categorize it as a star hotel the fourth one must be due to the location
