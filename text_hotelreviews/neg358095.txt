this hotel did not reflect how it looked on web site or the price paid we were supposed to end our european bike trip with two days here we only stayed one night we were so disappointed and had just driven hours there was a horrible smell on entering which unfortunately was in the rooms as well the first room we were given was small cramped and very grubby i decided that i had to say something despite hating complaining the young guy was very helpful and showed us a bigger room which was bit better although very grubby bad smell and had the toilet and shower partitioned behind a glass box i told them that i would only stay for one night which was agreed to be honest we just wanted away as quick as possible couldn t stand the smell we booked another hotel for the last night and paid less and there was no comparison if this hotel had cost less we would still have left due to the smell and cleanliness staff were lovely but this hotel needs a good clean and fix up the dining room was better this affected our last two days at the end of what had been a great trip still love amsterdam
