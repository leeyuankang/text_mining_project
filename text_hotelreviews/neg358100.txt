since my train was leaving in the early evening the next day i asked whether i could book a late check out i was told there wouldn t be a problem since there were enough rooms available and i only needed to ask again next morning so when i did all of a sudden a late check out was not possible and the clerk did not even bother to check the system and was quite rude also the bathroom was inside the room only separated by glass walls this was not clearly stated before the booking
