when booked i had a hope for a room without the normal disturbances of amsterdam especially night noise unfortunately even if the hotel looks to have been renovated recently the windows are a total shame you can hear steps even on the road and my room was at floor breakfast is kind of a rip off normally euro but there is a cheaper option of if you sign for it at check in what they don t tell you is that if you miss the breakfast you loose the money anyway wireless facility exists in all the rooms maybe but it is quite impossible to use it for even emails
