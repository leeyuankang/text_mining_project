room photos on booking com are not realistic photos of the superior room which i booked for one week of my stay staff seemed to be aware of this issue they confirmed to receive several complaints about this issue in the past however no corrective actions were made till now obviously i was so unhappy about the room that i have decided to check out from this hotel and move to another right after the first night for sure i will not be back as my trust as a client was broken and i think it is really embarrassing from such a hotel to promote rooms which do not correspond to reality internet i came for a business trip so i needed to work at the evenings however on floor where my room was located wifi had incredibly poor signal impossible to work blocked money on a bank account even though i stayed only one night money on my bank account were blocked due to pre authorization for days
