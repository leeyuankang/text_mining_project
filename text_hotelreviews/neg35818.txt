because of the shall we call it heritage style of the hotel there is a fair amount of filigree work around the mirrors and cabinets which attract dust and in the room we had they hadn t been cleaned in some time not a big thing for us but finicky people might take issue also there was one of those plug in room fresheners in our room what s the matter with just breathing the air that s there in any event the room freshener is on a switched circuit which can be turned off or like us you can remove it and bag it in plastic for the duration of your stay
