the superior room i was given was definitely not the one pictured on booking com its furnishings and carpeting dated from the or the carpet was really disgusting and the curtains not much better carpet in the corridor was very stained after i complained several times i received a larger room w newer carpet and the fridge promised in the reservation the gym did not seem to be ventilated was very small and contained only cardio machines no weights or stretching mats overall this hotel is not what is advertised and is not good value for money
