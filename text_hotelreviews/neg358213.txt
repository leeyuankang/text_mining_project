the room is nothing what you expect and you have to lug your luggage up three flights of stairs as the lift is not operational the staff and management not accommodating at all our tiny room quoted as superior was overcrowded with unnecessary furniture and the huge shower throws the small room completely off balance not a very pleasant stay at all even though we tried to make the best of our day stay
