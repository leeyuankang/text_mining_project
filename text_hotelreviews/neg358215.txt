the hotel is situated very far from the center although it is relatively close to the rijks museum a taxi from central station costs a ridicoulous while the cost to the airport is the room absolutely unacceptable it stunk of smelly socks and the sink was completely clogged an overall impression of filth the decor is s at best and by no stretch of the immagination is anywhere close to the images posted on booking com this hotel was the worst we ve ever been to
