we had specifically come to this hotel for the whirlpool suite which i had booked for my girlfriends birthday we the time up to be given the standard room even though our booking clearly said whirlpool suite the staff then tried to tell us that there was no difference in the rooms that they were still the same room evidently not as they are being sold as seperate rooms at different prices i was fuming at the fact they had even tried to blag this there s clearly a difference in the rooms hence the different price tags on each of them there comes a point where you need to accept responsibility for cocking up at no point were we apologised to for this but told to take it up with the website we booked it on so basically tried to disown any responsibility despite they had just double booked our room and completely shattered the birthday plans we had if this room was not available we quite simply would not have booked this hotel they had said come back tomorrow and we will be able to swap rooms we were only there for days on the night the room we had booked was still not available so we were upgraded to the penthouse suite which don t get me wrong was lovely however for our night we were hardly in the room as we had made numerous plans were leaving early the next morning so for the night which was my girlfriends birthday we were in a downgraded room to what we had booked which is fair to say completely ruined the birthday i had planned we spent days looking for a hotel with a whirlpool bath although the upgrade was nice it still through a spanner in the works for the whole trip we had to unpack and pack again every day of our holiday as we changed room each day which was highly inconvenient not the relaxing getaway we had planned that s for sure
