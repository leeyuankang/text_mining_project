the continental breakfast lacks variety there needs to be more choice especially for a highly rated hotel if you re into processed meat cut into tiny cubes and mini bread rolls it should suit you fine if you like to break fast like a king save yourself the disappointment and go somewhere else the breakfast room is so small i felt like i was sitting on someone s lap and table cloth was damp we asked the lady on duty for a full english extra cost at but food came and was a rationed toddler sized portion hotel in general needs an upgrade it looks old and dated floor boards creak our king sized bed was made up of two single beds pushed together there was a clear gap in the centre which was uncomfortable and could have been concealed better bathroom water temperature needs to be looked at my partner and i both had cold showers it s winter sort it out overall experience was very average i like a boutique hotel but this one is crying for a revamp
