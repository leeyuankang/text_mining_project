check in is rigid at this is difficult especially if you are flying in from asia where planes tended to arrive very early in the morning one cannot just dump the luggage after a long flight have a shower and get to work this is where big chain hotel are more convenient for business travellers it is not a major issue but wardrobe space is severely limited one have to fight to find some space among the clutter of fuse box kettle tea making top safe to try and hang a couple of jackets in my room i was in room my suggestion to the owner is that when they next renovate the room move the fuse box and th kettle safe etc to the same side of the wardrobe then at least you have half of a wardrobe for your guest to hang their clothes rather then none at all at the moment
