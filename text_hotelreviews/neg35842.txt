generally we had a very disappointing experience at the ashburn hotel we made the choice due to its location some good reviews and the look of the hotel in photos on line but were sadly mislead we have stayed in much nicer hotels for a lot less money at nearly a night it is way over priced for what you get at first everything seemed fine and acceptable but the longer we spent in the room the less we were impressed there was damaged furniture in the room arm chair had a slash right through the fabric on one arm with attempt to repair it there was loose plug sockets on the wall the entertainment system controls did not work in the bathroom the bath robes were old and worn looking the vanity unit in the bathroom had been poorly repaired with gaps between all the mirrors the carpets generally throughout the hotel were worn and dirty looking the tv and music entertainment system was basic and limited the breakfast room was cramped the breakfast staff were unhelpful and not very cheery the reception staff on the other hand were very polite and helpful we expected a lot more from a hotel in this area of london and at this price my advice stay in the crowne plaza or radisson across the road at least there you what you are going to get this was a special trip for my wife s birthday and was slightly tainted by the experience we had at this hotel however the rest of our weekend was excellent and we were thoroughly spoilt and well treated at every other place we went
