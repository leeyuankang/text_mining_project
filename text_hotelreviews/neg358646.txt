breakfast was a total disappointment the full breakfast was very expensive so we went for the cheaper option which there was very little choice the waitress serving us was very aloof and inefficient getting our orders totally mixed up as a consequence of this experience we decided not to have breakfast at the hotel again nor try the restaurant in the evening
