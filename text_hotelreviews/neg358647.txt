on the first night we were in room and the noise from the roof top bar was terrible we rang down twice to the reception and it did improve for a short while all we could hear was chairs being moved and a trolley moving across the roof this started at and only stopped around and other guests seem to think it was ok to shout as they walked back to their rooms and one lady decided to make a phone and sit in the elevator hall people should be informed if their noise issue with the room and in relation to the other guests notices should place around the hotel asking them to respect other guests we spoke to the reception again in the morning and where treated very professionally by the staff they where in a position to move us to a quite part of the hotel as an apology we received a bottle of champagne as a gift which was much appreciated but in hindsight the price of the room for the first night should have been refunded we will stay in the hotel on furture visits to barcelona but will make sure not to stay in a room effected by the roof bar
