the most strange thing is that staff at reception was not helpful at all during our visit we asked them three times to solve our problems all three with zero results first request was to book one very popular reataurant for our birthday party we got a letter at around midnight that it was impossible and with suggestion to come to reception to find the variants we decided that using of tripadvisors service would be more effective second request was to help to find the lost jacket the taxi when we asked the next day all that we got is reply that nobody brought the jacket we got no information about lost and found service of the taxi and etc and the third request was late check out all we need were three additional hours impossible we are fully booked was the reply so we got the total feeling that they just do not care about their guests at all that is very suprisingly and unpleasant for the hotel with such a high ratings the shower is not comfortable the water pressure is low
