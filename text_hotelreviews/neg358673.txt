advertised slippers in room all one size seemed like a size when as a man my feet are considering cost of hotel either don t offer or provide large medium small room description suggests a certain view but this is dependant on which part of the hotel you are put the first room had an outside wall for the view which was claustrophobic so we upgraded after days to a room with a balcony the room was great but there was no ground view as the surrounding walls were to high also as it had rained they were unable to change the damp sun lounge mattresses so these remained damp until we left between the two it made the balcony pointless i raised this point during and at the end of our stay disappointed with the advertising of the rooms in particular
