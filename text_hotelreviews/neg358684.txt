we got a room with no fresh air so we asked to change and were told that we were upgraded but the room we got was extremely noisy till very noisy from the restaurants and from am in the morning from the trucks that brings supplies we couldn t sleep from the noise and when you open the window you get all the smells from the restaurants because the chimney is just in front of the room it was the worse experience we had in a hotel very disappointed
