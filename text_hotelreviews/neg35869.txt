the hotel room was way over priced considering and completely misrepresented by its description the bed was described as a queen which by no means it was my boyfriend was woke early by sunlight through the curtains which wouldn t shut properly the breakfast was poor and pastries provided stale but by far the my biggest dislike is the poor way of charging for room rate the hotel ended up charging me twice i wouldn t recommend staying here and felt disppointed for my boyfriend who i had booked this stay as a christmas present
