the rooftop pool was a little disappointing the drinks at the bar were very expensive and the pool chairs filled up quickly the staff gave us a hard time when we turned up at the bar w o booking a table even though we were hotel guests it was never a problem to find a table but we were made to feel like we had done something wrong
