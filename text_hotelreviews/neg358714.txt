hotel is lovely and the room very nice however we were unlucky to have a problem with a sewerage smell in the bathroom it was very strong and unpleasant we were offered another room however we were tired from a long journey and elected to stay in the room if they remedied the situation they tried to fix the problem with cleaning fluids but it recurred and was particularly bad in the evening and this remained for our day stay i was told that this is a problem in barcelona during the summer
