lack of facilities and treatment was not worthy of a hotel that positions itself as luxury i was there in june for my wedding with a big party of guests we took over a lot of rooms in the hotel for a few nights no steamers and no irons are provided they make you use their laundry services which is appalling to oblige guests to do so and charge them when all they want to do is iron a shirt all the guests complained on my wedding day we were getting our hair and makeup done in a few rooms and the electricity kept cutting when the hairdryers were one which delayed everything and created panic lastly my husband wrote to them a few days before arriving and asked if they could put some flowers in the room to surprise me we were staying in the privilege room and they sent him a cost it was our wedding we should have had welcome flowers in the room to begin with without asking a nice gesture doesn t harm a proper luxury hotel would not do that especially for how expensive they are we were all expecting much more from such a high end hotel disappointed
