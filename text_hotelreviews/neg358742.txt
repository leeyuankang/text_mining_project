it is very noisy which you expect but the rooms at the front of the hotel are difficult to sleep in there was shouting at partying outside until on saturday the gym is extremely small the general pool and spa day is great however don t go here if you re a gym bunny the worst part of the trip was the unhelpful front desk staff i asked to check out at but was told this wasn t possible we asked them to bring our bags down and keep them at reception but they didn t bother
