the steam room in the spa is not hot enough firstworldproblems i know but it really isn t the staff in the rooftop bar don t welcome you when you come up for a hotel like this i d expect to be greeted and seated not have to wander around wondering which bit is restaurant only the bit with the best view is solely a restaurant annoyingly and which bit is the bar the lifts are very mildly frustrating the spa was unattended and i couldn t find any water inside despite signs indicating there was water available again a small problem but anyone who uses a spa knows you want to hydrate while doing so
