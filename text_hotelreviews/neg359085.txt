the place is a bit dated the checkin experience was met with a bit of arrogance but i write that off to communication barriers i queried the fact that that breakfast was included i did so politely and felt that i was proven wrong with a waiter that made a bigger deal of the fact that it wasn t than was necessary i checked my paperwork again and told the waiter it was fine and my misunderstanding of the booking he then brings me the phone to the table where i was once again reminded by reception that i was wrong completely unnecessary and quite condescending from the staff just didn t like the attitude
