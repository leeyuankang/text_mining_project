in our room we could hear the rumble of the underground subway the front window would not seal shut properly so street noise was louder than it should ve been but we were so exhausted after sightseeing it didn t effect our ability to sleep bring ear plugs and eye shades and you ll be fine the room could ve used a fresh coat of paint and we would ve liked to have had lotion offered as a part of the bathroom amenities
