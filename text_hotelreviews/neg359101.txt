accused of having not paid even when showed the booking confirmation and bank statement foul smell in the room no air conditioning even though it clearly says that they do have it the room was degrees celcius im from scotland so as you can probably guess it was unbareable to sleep at night and i was reduced to sleeping on the floor as it was the coldest part of the room and they refused to change us rooms on top of that there was no windows to open only a door with a glass pane behind it the hotel is in a square and the economy rooms are on the inside so if you open the door every room can see straight in your room and the bed is right next to the door so very little privacy anyone walking through the halls can also see in as they are open aswell at night they switch multicoloured lights on and there s no blackout curtain so your room turns into some sort of a rave at about o clock as if it wasn t already hard enough to sleep
