i had booked a double room with air conditioning the first night we were put up in a real small room with an old air conditioner which was not working efficiently when i complained i was told that that was the room i had chosen i told the person that maybe i had chosen the small double room but i was told it was an ac room i was uncomfortable because of the heat though they sent a person promptly to repair it was not functioning and i had to spend a night there because there were no rooms available but the next day after i insisted that they shift me i told them i would write a review on trip advisor they shifted me to the same category of room but it was so different than the old room they put us up in the first night it was well furnished had ventilation was a little more roomy whereas the earlier room had one small window it made me wonder why we were put up in such a room are they supposed to reserve the best rooms for foreigners did they expect indians to take things lying down and accept any kind of room provided to them are we paying any less for the room though the location is excellent the comfort is far more important and you have to give equal treatment to everyone due to this discomfort i preponed my trip by a day
