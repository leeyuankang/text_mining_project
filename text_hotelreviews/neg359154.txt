we booked three rooms same type price however on check in we noticed one was very different to the other two way below standard and utterly unacceptable for the price we paid had we not seen the other rooms we would have been unhappy but accepted it i dont think that type of room is acceptable to give to someone in saying that the staff were very accommodating and nice about it they acknowledged the issue and upgraded us to an amazing suite on our second and final night they couldnt change us on the first night as they were fully booked and gave all three rooms breakfast on the house for the second night very good customer service and made a bad situation better
