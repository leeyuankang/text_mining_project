when i placed the reservation i made sure to state that the booking was on condition that we were allocated a room with a proper double bed and not two single beds pushed together on arrival we had two single beds pushed together they were even made up with bedding for two single beds this was not what we had ordered paid for we asked to be reallocated a room as requested and receptionist was very unhelpful saying they were unable to do so i asked for the bed beds to be made up with linen for a double bed so that we could use it as a double to be told that there were no housekeeping staff available i insisted that linen was brought to our room and i had to make it up myself also the advertised roof terrace was not open when we tried to visit it
