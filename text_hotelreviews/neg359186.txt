air conditioning was set only to provide heat and that too at night only if it gets warm i was told to open the window as it was the first week in april we found that the room did get warm from the afternoon onwards breakfast was not worth the euro so after the first morning we went ro a nearby place which served a good breakfast at half the cost eventhough i booked more than two weeks in advance my comfort room at the back had a window which opened on to a wall they told me that the hotel was full and also that the front rooms would be noisy from the street although both the rooms were generally clean there was dust in corners and at edges of the room bathroom door would not close properly as the door had sprung restaurant did not have an attractive menu
