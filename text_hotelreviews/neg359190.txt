the standard room we were in room was right next to the main atrium and it rained the night we stayed there so it was the noisiest room and we didnt sleep that night at all also we didnt realise there was an electrically operated blind next to the bed so we slept with the curtain open all night and it was bright in our room overnight finally and this is booking com s fault the room rate said breakfast was included but actually it wasnt so we turned up for breakfast which looked lovely and we couldnt have it unless we paid extra
