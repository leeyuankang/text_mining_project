lack of wardrobe cupboard space hangers on an open hanging rack beside the bed no drawer space or shelves for underwear and personal belongings etc so had to live out of our suitcase for our days stay more wire coathangers were supplied on request safe was on the floor underneath the hanging contraption meant that you had to lie down on the floor to get to it massive comfy bed took up most of the floor space in the room one plastic chair provided so nowhere for people to sit except on the bed bathroom ok but shower had half of it missing no slider just the fitting where it should have been quite a good breakfast on offer not included in room price but not cheap this hotel is definitely not eurostars best but you are probably paying for location in las ramblas
