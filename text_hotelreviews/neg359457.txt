although the location is good in terms of accessibility it s horrible in terms of noise because it s right in the middle of the square it is incredibly noisy because all night you can hear the people outside who are drunk and partying until minimum it is incredibly loud and disruptive for travelers who are trying to rest for an early day start to explore the city also the staff aren t very friendly they seem like they don t want to be there and that they re annoyed with the hotel guests whenever they re asked questions they also misinformed us that our breakfast was included in the booking we assumed it was a nice gesture because we were on our honeymoon so when they told us that we said thank you and had breakfast during our stay at checkout we were asked to pay extra for breakfast and when we explained we were told it was included the front desk staff said my colleague must have been confused and at that the breakfast wasn t very good limited selection always late and cold
