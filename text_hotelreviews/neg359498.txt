our hotel room had a faint smell of sewage which is common in spanish hotels in my experience the view from the balcony overlooked the back of a building behind the hotel and the alleyway below a view of la rambla would have been much better but i understand that not all rooms can have such a view after checking out by we had some time to wait before we had to go to the airport but there is no lounge area in the hotel just four armchairs in the reception area next to a sliding front door that opens and closes every few minutes because of people walking past
