the beds were the only complaint we had we had to change rooms because our bed was so uncomfortable but the matter was delt with quickly and effectively and as mentioned previously the staff were absolutely delightful yes the first bed we were given was uncomfortable but hilton really was fantastic in resolving the problem we are very happy customers and we would thoroughly recommend this hotel
