it was very expensive and for us it was just very poor value for money we only booked one night there because we were due to go to concert at wembley the view from our window was of a corrugated wall about two meters away there was three smallish bottles approx of water which you had to pay each for there were no bath robes as it claimed there would be the carpet was stained in various places and the tv did not work properly there was a tray with a kettle for your tea and coffee needs but it contained three small cups three sachets of coffee three decaf coffee two teabags two lemon and ginger teabags two sachets of white sugar two brown two sweetener and three little pots milk we were not impressed we had stayed for three days beforehand at the travelodge stratford for half the cost of the one night at the hilton and it was far superior spotlessly clean nothing was too much trouble and you did not have to pay for the extra things we would definitely not recommend the hilton the travelodge was much nicer
