the clock radio dock in our room didn t work a member of staff attended and advised us that all the music docks had been disconnected to stop people playing music too loudly at night as they had received previous complaints it sounded like a strange excuse to me as he just went and got another one which worked and plugged it in for us why not just remove them altogether if that really was the case
