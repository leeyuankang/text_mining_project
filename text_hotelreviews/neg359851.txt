first time in a hilton and i was not impressed the reception is a open hall not very welcoming the fixtures and fitting where badly maintained from broken lift buttons faulty standard lamps to bath shower tap handles that come off the worst was the net curtains in the room where properly filthy and the carpet stained the place needed a good clean i didn t help that the hotels theme colour is brown also the room amenties are dated no charging usb points the television was over elaborate to use and had no on screen programme guide and programme information also i would expect a on screen interactive service to request hotel services but no old fashion telephone ordering and handle mounted request forms for breakfast if it was not for the location quality of the bathroom and comfort of the bed i would have been unwilling to pay the bill overall not impressed would not chose it again or any other hilton hotel
