we arrived and we were told that the car park was discounted rate we were also told that we were in a disabled room as all booking com customers are put in disabled rooms we agreed as my husband had a thr op in march we placed our luggage in the room and did not look closely till later when we came back the bathroom did have a walk in shower but had a very low toilet and sink which was a problem for us there was a very small window which made the room dark and appeared drab the view was a roof basically no view at all we had a drink in the bar and tipped as always and found out a service charge had been added as well next morning we checked out and i expressed my dissatisfaction with the car park charge only to be informed that it was actually i didn t get a chance to talk about our issues as the receptionist chose to talk to us with her hand which is extremely rude and demonstrates that she was not listening the car park was a multi storey with a narrow exit which we only just got out of there were scrapes and broken tiles on the way out would definately not stay there again or recommend to others
