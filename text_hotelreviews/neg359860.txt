i did not like the fact that after paying for a one night stay there were so many additional costs that you wouldn t expect when paying so much for a room for one night and which are also usually included these days in most hotels a couple of examples being for basic wifi and a tray charge for room service the tray charge seems to be a means for the hotel to take away any tip from the the staff who deliver the room service as i would normally give the room service staff a tip directly i very much dislike this practice which i have seen becoming more common in some restaurants and hotels i was also very shocked when we asked for one glass of prosecco in the bar on the floor and were told this would cost the glass was tiny and needless to say we did not entertain paying such a price this was a brazen example of a business taking advantage of a captive audience i e knowing there would be a large amount of guests due to the fa cup final in my opinion these inflated prices reflect very badly on hilton as a company and such treatment of their guests smacks of greed and opportunism
