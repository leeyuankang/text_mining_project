we met up as group of people in the bar before going to wembley stadium and on out of visits to the bar we were overcharged when they are already charging for beer from plastic glasses to overcharge twice was very poor what made it worse was they said they could not refund cash and gave of the ladies a free glass of prosecco to make up for the overcharge
