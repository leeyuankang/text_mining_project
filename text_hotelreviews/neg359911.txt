almost everything we asked for a quiet room when we made the booking but we got a room closest to the elevator bathroom had a bad smell smelled like bad bacon and the staff initially refuses to clean it again by saying that it s just chemical smell temperature is cold inside the room this hotel s ac s max temp is celcius in reality celcius and there is no heater in the bathroom which makes taking shower a very painful experience my girlfriend caught a cold because the temperature in the bathroom is too cold after my girlfriend caught a cold we decided to leave the hotel on the next day we booked for a two day stay originally and the reception refuses to give a refund due to hour cancellation policy the hotel is also short staffed which makes all the staff super busy and anxious the house keeper was super angry at something and talked angrily and loudly on her phone to someone when she did the housekeeping
