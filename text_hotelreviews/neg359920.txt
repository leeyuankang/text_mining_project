unfortunately that s where the good bits end staff were shocking don t think any of them had ever encountered cup final day before sky bar was shut and that was sole reason we booked this specific hotel restaurant was apparently fully booked for lunch and yet tables were empty and we wouldn t get any lunch all in all it was utter rubbish in the hotel itself just easy to get to the stadium was its only plus point
