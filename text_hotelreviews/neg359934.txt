sky bar was closed prior top kick off and that was main reason we chose this hotel staff were awful and looked like they had never experienced a cup final day ever before restaurant was fully booked for lunch and yet we arrived at and attempted a booking immediately specifically requested early check in between when i booked and yet rooms were not ready until after all in all it was disgraceful for the hilton brand that we expect a certain level of service from and yet it was one of the most awful hotels and service i have ever had
