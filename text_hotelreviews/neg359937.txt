the smell was horrible and was lurking all day and night car parking described as for the day but if you needed to take the car out in between you had to pay more as well as this the car park barrier in the morning when we were leaving wasnt working leaving us over an hour late to our next destination i could have just parked in the open car park at the top of the road which was all day and you could come in and out at anytime as it was pay and display
