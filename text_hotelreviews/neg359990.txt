we ordered food from room service at and we hadn t eaten all day so we were starving room service finishes at and our food was nowhere to be seen by i called to complain and apparently there was no record of the order ever being made but i very clearly heard my boyfriend make the order after a while on the phone complaining as everywhere would be closed by now and we were so hungry with no options we were offered complementary sandwiches and a cheese platter better than nothing when you re so hungry unfortunate however that the issue did arise initially i would ve expected something more organised for a hilton
