although i didn t venture down to the bar in the evening the hotel felt a little soulless would be a good word lots of memorabilia in the public areas which you might expect from a hotel which is literally a stones throw from wembley stadium but is somehow all felt artificial the staff were professional but not particularly warm or welcoming the major negative for me was that the disabled parking space was cordoned off apparently to discourage the general public from using it my partner who is a paralympic athlete dropped me at the hotel she has two prosthetic legs and wanted to join me for a drink but the car park entrance is a fair walk from reception so not at all convenient t surely the disabled parking bay is meant for the general public who are using the hotel i e disabled people who are dropping off picking up guests
