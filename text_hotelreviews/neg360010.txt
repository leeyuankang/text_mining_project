the breakfast does need some attention not wanting to be overly critical but star and serving coffee in a mug and only choice of cold meat mortadella seems rather limited also wifi limited to hour in public areas i don t really understand the reason for this also the connectivity in the room was okay the download rate was rather slow i would have preferred a separate shower from the bath shower curtains always leak and make the floor slippery
