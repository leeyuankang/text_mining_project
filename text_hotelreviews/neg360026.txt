the staff completely ruined my birthday night told me the boxing would be on and when we arrived all ready it was not showing i then had no time to do anything else which made me furious the down stairs in the hotel was far to rowdy me and my girlfriend wanted a quiet weekend away and there was loads of drunken people and the noise level was ridiculous
