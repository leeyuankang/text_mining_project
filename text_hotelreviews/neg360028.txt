the second night with x factor personnel staying at the hotel i was denied entry to the hotel as i was wearing jeans and a t shirt and a santa hat as i had been a guest at the royal albert hall on my return to the hotel the entrance was cordoned off due to somebody called sharon osborn being in the hotel lobby i had to wait over minutes for security to eventually say if you are actually a guest you should have a key card i showed him my key card and eventually he let me in then once entering the hotel was stopped again by x factor staff wanting to know why i was coming into the hotel i had to show my key card again to prove i was a guest my second evening was ruined by staff at the hilton wembley and security staff
