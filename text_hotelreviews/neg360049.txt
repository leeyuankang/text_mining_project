there were not enough staff on duty meaning that queuing was a feature of the stay given that there was a function on at wembley arena on the friday night there was just not enough staff in the bar we waited around minutes to be served when we ordered drinks a pizza and a burger the lady serving us was excellent however instead of ordering or drinks we only had one lost business we queued for breakfast and then queued to settle our bill like the people behind us who said we have never queued so much in a hilton hotel
