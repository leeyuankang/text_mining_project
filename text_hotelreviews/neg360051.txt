only complaints when you upgrade to stay on the executive floors the rooms are no different to the others what you get is the lounge access and at extra a night not sure it s worth it alcohol can only be consumed there for hours a day so a day for a water and coke seems a little daft could do with some extras in the room to make it stand out thing the shower was a little poor for the price of the room
