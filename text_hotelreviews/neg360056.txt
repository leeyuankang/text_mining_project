receptionists were terrible the only lady there was keep talking on the phone and nobody gave me any help or attention it seems that they are interns or trainees from a hotel school lack of experience and skills i understand that people need time to learn and practice but i also believe that to ensure the quality of service a supervisor should be around the receptionists again after checked in i found that i was not told the wifi password normally they would indicate me at other hilton hotels i called the reception three times the first two calls were not answered i waited long enough and i also asked for extra shampoo and dental sets i asked for two dental sets but they only sent me one they said in but actually sent in i had to call them again and after another they finally sent me the second set it was really late already and i had to keep myself awake to wait for them the water pressure for the shower was really low not comfortable at all water was not hot enough neither you can not get into the hotel from the car park they provided i understand this and this is a minor problem
