where does one begin booked an executive corner suite for a nice little treat for our stay and to a show great view but that s about it our room took what seemed an eternity to be released then we were never contacted as promised so after the long wait decided to go to reception eventually got our room first off we noticed only one dressing gown with no slippers as we started to shower then decided to look around to see what else was amiss pulled back the sheets and to our horror found pubic hairs and dirty footprints on the bed sheets on further investigation there were several stains on pillows cases and sheets also the cup covers were also used and dirty complained and was given another similar room similar being the operative word we were basically given a downgrade complained again to the manager who proceeded to argue that this new room was not a downgrade at this point i invited the manager to come up and compare the two rooms he declined and then after some heated conversations was given a third room this room was ok but by then the damage was done we were late getting ready for our show and put a damper on the whole stay the food and drinks in the executive lounge was not up to the standard of the waldorf in aldwych so we were all in all very disappointed with our stay we were offered a discount on our room which we accepted to make matters worse the reception took two amounts off of my debit card the original booking fee and the subsequent discounted fee followed by more phone calls and arguments only to be told that they cannot refund the fee until several days later so everyone beware of this procedure as i am not into funding loan mr hilton with my hard earned cash for free still awaiting some form of an apology by email guess we have got a long wait all in all not a pleasant experience for our nice little break
