we checked in at as we were there to watch the nfl both rooms signed the paperwork however we were never asked for a credit card details for room extras which seems to be normal practice they did look after our luggage though and gave a receipt unfortunately when we came back that night they had no record of one of the rooms being reserved this was very frustrating especially as we had already done the checking in process that morning we never got our luggage that night either but had to go down to reception in the morning to collect it ourself not happy
