my room was opposite the lift which from my experience tells me lots of noise as every person from every room will walk past classed as an executive room i would call it a normal room as expected the room was very noisy the sound of chairs dragging on a hard floor which tells me there was a staff room nearby this woke me both mornings on the first morning not good
