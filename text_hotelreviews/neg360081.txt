the only thing i disliked was the fact the mini fridge in the room was not prestocked with soft drinks but i understand different hotels have different policies and it wouldn t stop me coming back in the future i needed a drink late at night and felt it an inconvenience to call rooms service for a soda and asy daughter was asleep i didn t want to leave the room to get it
