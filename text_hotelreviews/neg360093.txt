checking in the receptionist needed help from a colleague and then couldn t find my hilton honors account despite me giving her the number she seemed generally bored and not too interested in welcoming guests in an executive room for people we had one bathrobe called housekeeping times before i could get through and general reception twice always engaged said they would bring one up never did the lamp next to my bed wasn t working as the bulb had gone as it was around and after the fiasco with the bathrobe didn t seem worth bothering to try and get this sorted out in the bathroom out of bath sheets one was new and fluffy and one old and worn odd to leave two such disparate towels and so obvious one was ready for throwing out this stay was disappointing especially as it was a treat for a friends birthday and it felt like no one had an eye on the fine detail i expect better at a night
