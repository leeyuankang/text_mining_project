the accessible facilities room only had one small double bed and the hotel unable to make this a twin room whereas all other rooms can be either twin or double this was a problem as twin had been ordered two brothers the bar staff were incredible slow both at around and then later around plenty of staff on duty but no organisation by manager and so some of us waited over minutes to be served whereas other people were served much more quickly even when this was very politely pointed out staff still continued to serve one side of bar and ignored people on other side this was a shame as breakfast staff and restaurant staff were so much better
