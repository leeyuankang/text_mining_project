no tea or coffee facilities in the room or complementary water snacks like all other hotels we have stayed dental kits arent great with horrible tasting toothpaste that still leaves your teeth feeling dirty considering it is a hilton hotel we expected it to be much better than any other hotel we ve stayed at next time we would definitely choose the crowne plaza again over the hilton not a great experience
