lenins are not changed we stayed for a total of nights and i had a mushroom sauce spot on the inside of the duvet cover it was never changed and i did not ask for it to be changed because i wanted to see if they really change their lenins every days as they promise i was disappoined unfortunately the floor has almost rooms and the lifts are situated in one place only for our room it was a relatively long walk especially when we came back with shopping bags make sure to ask for a room close to the lift if this is not convenient for you
