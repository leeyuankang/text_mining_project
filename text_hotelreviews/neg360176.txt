we went to the pool at on a sunday the changing room shower cubicles and pool area were covered in hair if appeared to have not been cleaned for a very long time considering it was evening time we were shocked to find a group of children playing noisily with frisbees and unsupervised in the pool the water was disgusting with huge clumps of hair floating around so we headed off to the sauna to find that it was even more rank there i ve been to council community pools with a much higher standard of cleanliness my advice would be not to visit this hotel if it is for the pool sauna everything else was great
