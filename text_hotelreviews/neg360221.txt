miss information regarding opening times of the bar area a group of us went there to enjoy a last drink of the evening at to be told bar closed at this then meant we went out of hotel spending pounds on cabs to find nothing only to be told when we woke to the hotel again they said we could have had the drinks for reasons we could have bought on our room tab and drunk them outside of the bar and secondly when i checked the hotel information the bar is supposed to be open till spoilt the evening for us all
