room not ready till which really spoilt our plans to soak up the wembley atmosphere before the kick off we were told by reception we could use the executive lounge facilities which we had planned to after our hour drive i booked and paid for an executive suite for that very reason so that we could have food and drink after our long journey but on trying to access the lounge we were told it was out of bounds till later but we could go to the sky bar instead so we did but our supposed complimentary food and drink turned into a bill for beers vodka and lemonades and fish and chips i understand that there was a match on and players were still at the hotel but i would imagine a large amount of people book this hotel to watch various sporting events so it s not fair that i paid a lot of money for facilities i wasn t allowed to have on checkout i complained but the receptionist just shrugged and said at least your team won had she validated my car park ticket for free i would have been quite pleased but no i still had to pay the car parking fee i accept things don t always work out but it s how businesses compensate their customers that sets them apart the hilton offered nothing not even an apology there s a lot of hotels close enough to the stadium so in future i will choose one of those
