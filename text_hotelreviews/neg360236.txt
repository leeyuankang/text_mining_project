the only thing i would have to say that really disappointed me was the bed during mine my friend s stay on june the bed was like a dream one of those mattresses you lay down on just sink into however during this time around s stay the mattress was less than satisfactory extremely disappointing i sat down on the bed upon entering the room immediately noticed the difference as did my friend we both ended up not being able to sleep properly during our stay on july due to not being able to get comfortable as the mattress was too hard to be able to get comfortable on we both ended up with our shoulders back hurting when we checked out the next day please please change back to the mattress supplier you were using during
