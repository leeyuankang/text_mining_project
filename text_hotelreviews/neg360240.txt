being told by the barman that i was being awkward for sending back a beer that was absolutely rancid he didn t want to take it off the bill and continued to tell me that the beer was fine luckily a fellow customer tasted the beer and agreed with my point this barman is a liability to your hotel i complained to the duty manager but he seemed indifferent their loss will never stay here again
