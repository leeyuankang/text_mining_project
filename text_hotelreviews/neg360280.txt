the check out staff was extremely rude and unhelpful when i raised my issues she did not even acknowledge my complaint nor did she apologies or even offer a complaint form she instead tried to ignore me and was extremely dismissive and rude the room was very dirty with a minibar empty of any hotel items but filled with some previous guest private food items that been growing mold for some time dirty toilet seat and rubbish in the bathroom stained bedding i will think twice to book with hilton again in the future due to this
