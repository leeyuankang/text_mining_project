never again the hilton had a event on during my stay the music was so loud i could feel the vibrations through the floor having specifically requested a quiet room i really didn t appreciate being kept awake until the early hours of the morning in addition the staff within the executive lounge were incredibly rude and uninviting had i turned up in a business suit i m sure i d of got a different reception but as myself and my husband arrive for breakfast we had the door firmly closed in our faces by the lounge manager
