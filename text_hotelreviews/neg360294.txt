i thought the hotel was over priced based on the fact the room was really quiet basic i really disliked the fact i couldn t open a small window a notch to allow some fresh air to circulate on a hotter day the majority of the channels on the television wouldn t connect and i think for the i paid i was a little down on a day that has cost me a lot of money for a break away for get away it s a shame as i would have loved to come back and have a better room on a later date the breakfast did deserve crest as it was delicious
