i would not recommend leaving you re bags with the hotel if u arrive early or after check out i left mine when i arrived early and when i checked in and asked for my bag they took me to the storage and let me find my own bag and did not check any details so i could have taken the lv bags and other designers as well as mine also they need to clean the front desks theres alot of dust on there lamps and stains in the rooms
