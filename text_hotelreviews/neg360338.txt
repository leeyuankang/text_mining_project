i would have expected a better stocked hospitality tray and also complimentary water picky i may be but would have least expected biscuits on the tray and and more teabags etc also think having to pay for the bottle of water is extortionate even at london prices also as we were only staying one night i would have expected that housekeeping would have known this and would not have expected them knocking on the door before am to clean it seeing we had room until noon check out organisation at breakfast could be a little better having to constantly ask for tea coffee clean cutlery etc shouldn t have to happen
