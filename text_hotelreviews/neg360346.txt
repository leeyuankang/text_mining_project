for amount of money we paid for a executive room it certainly wasn t value for money was looking forward to going to the sky bar after a gig at wembley but couldn t get in because they let so many non residents in the queue was out the main reception and you could only go up in one lift we also had to queue to get in the other bar they wouldn t let us charge our drinks to the room although location was excellent i would not stay there again
