there is no fair system of obtaining service at the bar when it is busy the bar staff look at whoever is in front of them rather than asking who is next i would really prefer to stand in a queue and wait my turn in a fair way its unfortunate that the public display their ignorance and continue to selfishly push in needless to say i left and spent my money in another establishment
