i appreciate that the hotel was very busy on the evening of our stay but the cleanliness of our room just wasn t really good enough for such an esteemed hotel there were long red hairs in the bed i m a brunette and there were plates with the previous occupants breakfast still on at our door these plates were still there when we checked out on the saturday can t really comment on the rest of the facilities as no one appeared available to let me know how to use them i don t normally leave negative reviews but i thought you would like to knkw why i wouldn t be keen to return
