the service and restaurant was very poor we have stayed here twice before and had an excellent time the service in the restaurant was awful and terribly slow the standard of the wine has dramatically fallen the food took ages to arrive and was overpriced eg i ordered scallops and received two of the tiniest scallops i have ever sen on sbed of green mush for over pounds it took minutes to arrive the couple next to us had a meal that arrived cold after a minute wait much better friendly service and food from pizza express yards away
