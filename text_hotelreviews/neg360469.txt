disappointed that the night manager seemed to target our group which ultimately spoiled our evening after being alerted that our music was too loud out of respect for other guests of the hotel we turned the music off not down the night staff deemed it necessary to continuously patrol on the floor we were staying on inevitably the next knock at the door came and we were told that if we didn t go back to our own rooms we would have to find alternative accommodation as a group we knew we had kept the noise levels down to a minimum and even the people who were in the next room came out to say the only persons voice they could hear was that of the night manager i proceeded to ask if there had been another complaint about the level of noise coming from from the room which the night manager responded i don t have to answer that as a result our party decided it would be in everybody s best interest if we went back to our rooms after all we didn t want to be paying a rate of per night with no bed to sleep on which was what we were threatened with spoiled what is our only weekend away of the year apart from that the hotel is in a great location and majority of the staff are very welcoming
