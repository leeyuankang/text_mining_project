i stayed at the hilton wembley with my girlfriend several times and enjoyed my stay this time it was on valentine s day of this year it was also the first time i have made a request with them which was a simple one for a bottle of wine and some chocolates to be in our room up arrival despite emailing them twice this request was not only denied but it was also completely ignored so i arrived unsure of whether this day would be made that bit more special for my girlfriend and i this was not an extravagant request and had been granted upon staying at other hotels such as novotel wembley on other special occasions however the least i would expect would be the decency of a reply from staff in the morning we were woken with a ridiculously loud message on the speaker warning us that a situation was in progress and we should wait for further announcements this continued for approximately minutes without anything else being said until another message came up advising us it was safe to return to the hotel reception i am not sure what the problem may have been but as a matter of safety and judging by the last message given it could ve potentially been serious therefore i believe all guests should have been told to stay in their rooms and wait for further announcements due to our experience at this stay i believe the hilton failed to meet the high standards they claim to have and in doing so have lost a loyal guest i can not express my disappoint any more
