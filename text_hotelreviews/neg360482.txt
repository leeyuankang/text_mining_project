the hotel seemed as though they were under staffed to the amount of staff they had last year i had requested if it was possible a room close to the lifts and i had an email confirming my request but when we arrived the only way to do this was to put a single bed into a double room which was close to the lifts but then we would have had less space to move around so sadly we had to decline the family guest room which we were booked into was too far away from the lifts and there isn t a family room close to the lifts so it was hard work as myself and my mum are disabled and we really struggled getting to and from and ended up having room service for all of us as it was too far for us to walk the quality of the room service food was of a very disappointing standard especially for the price and we couldnt eat it where as last year we couldn t complain about the room service food also the room cards didn t work when we got to our room and i had to find a telephone to ring reception and wait for another card to be brought up to us i think that it is wrong that my hhonours from last year does not count as i didn t book straight through the hotel but surely if you have paid and stayed in the hotel then you deserve to have the reccognition whether it is booked directly or not
