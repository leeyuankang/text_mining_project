the evening meal service pre show was poor the front of house did their best but the food couldn t come quick enough as soon as we ordered we were told it d be a min wait this was after the resaurant opened took mins for our food to arrive other tables never recieved their food in time given the location i was expecting a service geared towards guests attending events at the arena or stadium when the food did arrive it was excellent but there was obviously a staffing capacity issue
