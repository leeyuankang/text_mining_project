the staff at the fitness centre swimming pool part were quite rude i bought a nose clip from there and the woman who served me took my card to use in the machine and tapped it on the card machine thinking it was contactless without asking my permission then when i left my towel on the table by the swimming pool by accident and let the staff know i said sorry and i said i hope that s not too bad and very rudely a woman replied of course its a problem but i will deal with it so i did not like the attitude of the staff
