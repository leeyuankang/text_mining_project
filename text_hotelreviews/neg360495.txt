safe in room wasn t working very poor slow service in the legends bar at one point there were people waiting for nearly minutes to be served and there was only one barman present around midnight also as reported to hotel management there were some very dodgy practices going on especially by one bar man i have the name and time of this on receipt that is adding service charge automatically and then not explaining why it was being added nor giving the opportunity for it to be removed even though it should be discretionary further he rounded up the bill so he said that s gave change of when the bill said in other words a nice little earner for him if he did that each time throughout the night
