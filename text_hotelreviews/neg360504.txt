location it was too far away from london central and there weren t so many things to see around either than wembley stadium the operator was often busy on the line i had to call more than or times just for a simple information question i felt like the receptionist was a bit too lazy to provide me with some information about london as it was my first time visiting i really needed bit of information for sight seeing etc she told me to get a brochure by myself and eventually i gained no information from her during our stay there was a christmas eve party due to the noise i couldn t sleep so i set in the lobby around where i found drunk girls disturbing me i think that the hotel should also consider other guests by not holding a loud noisy and unpleasant event
