the fact that the room we had only had a view of a wall wasn t so great and the fact that neither of us could get any kind of phone signal from inside the room was exceptionally bad if we wanted to make phone calls we had to go out of the hotel in addition we ordered room service one night after leaving a concert at the arena and when the waiter delivered it he noticed that we had a map of the tube open on our laptop spotting this he said oh you re figuring out where to put the bomb cue the blank stares however the rest of the staff we met and interacted with were generally quite pleasant
