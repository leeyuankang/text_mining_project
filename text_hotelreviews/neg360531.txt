bed was a little bit hard staffs were kind but there should have been someone who directly takes care of customer s needs when i requested to search for my lost stuff it took much longer time to solve it because they just asked to someone involved in house keeping and relied on the answers if the staffs initially went to the room and search it directly the lost stuffs would have been easily found
