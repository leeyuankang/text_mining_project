i didn t like the way the staff treated us no manager around they didn t have the same type room that we had paid for so they downgraded our room and never paid us back the difference in the price they kept changing our room the maids just made up the beds and never cleaned the room or never left any supplies of towel bath supplies or tea and coffee in the room
