only two problems with this hotel the rooms air conditioning in the bedroom would not go below degrees c making it excessively hot to try and sleep in but the worse thing was the bar in the hour and a half we were in there it took minutes to get a drink the staff used their hands to add lemon or lime to the drinks when spirits were measured they tipped most of the drink over their fingers beer glasses were upturned and stacked on the drip trays prior to being filled so they were contaminated around the rim none of the staff ever washed their hands no second sink for tap water so this also was cross contaminated with general grime and rubbish orders were wrong constantly with at least couples complaining to the manager in the time we were there bottle tops were thrown on the floor making a serious slipping hazard for the staff all of which had a serious lack of understanding of english for a four star hotel it was disgusting which is why we chose not to eat there oh and at some point the beer prices went up by a a pint for no reason
