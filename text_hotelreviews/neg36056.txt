there was no hot water in the bathroom sink there was a laundry snafu and we didn t have fresh bath towels for the last days of our stay also the guest computers with attached printers didn t have ink so if i needed anything printed and i did i had to forward link or email to the property s business email account and have an employee print it out for me defeats the purpose of having guest printers just buy more ink cartridges
