the mini bar was empty upon arrival and i have since found out that the hotel charged me for the consumption of a whole mini bar despite the fact i didn t have anything to potentially take from it i have since raised this with my bank as an error but i sincerely hope this does not become an issue unfortunately i cannot afford to spend on alcohol when i am away for business purposes
