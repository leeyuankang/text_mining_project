my credit card was charged even though i chose the pay later booking when i contacted the hotel i was told that they don t have a pay later option i really wanted to stay at this hotel for the price and the location so i cancelled my original booking and rebooked and the non refundable rate when i inquired about the refund of the original booking i was told that since i chose the non refundable rate i would not be getting a refund a call to booking com and i was finally issued a refund i understand that it is a new hotel so i give them the benefit of the doubt i would still recommend this hotel and will stay next time i visit
