i was given the room absolutely no views there was a huge structure part of the hotel just in front of the window so it was sad that such a beautiful location was fully hidden from the room too much sound from the adjacent room the lady in the other room was not being too noisy still it was like i was with them breakfast was very average and i would suggest if you are in london do not bother for such a trivial breakfast at hilton go out and for half the price get fresh and varied breakfast
