arrived at the hotel and all the staff seemed overwhelmed and disorganised had a list of crossed out room numbers to go by and took to sort out a room we had booked a month ago with staff going to check which rooms were free which made the start of the trip quite stressful however once the room was sorted we loved it and the facilities were great a bit cosy with the sofa bed pulled out but was manageable
