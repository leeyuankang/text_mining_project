chaotic management staff were shifting all the time when problems occured they said they would solve it in a friendly way but the problems were never solved the door lock was dead the first day we arrived so we had to change a room we lost something in that room and they promised to get it to us everyday we had to explain the situation to a new staff and the lost stuff never came back to us finally a supervisor promised to mail the stuff to us in newcastle but ten days has passed and still nothing all in all i don t recommend this place considering its high price and unpleasant service
