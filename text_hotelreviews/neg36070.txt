check in was pathetically slow arriving at the hotel couldn t tell me if booking com or the hotel had already taken payment so i had to pay again hopefully not twice but still need to check my credit card statement eventually zzzz checked in but they still didn t have a room available for me so i had to leave my bag and come back check out was also very slow seems like staff and booking system need more training examination etc
