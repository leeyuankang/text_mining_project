extremely stingy place to stay no air conditioning as stated only switched on during the summer months despite degree spring heat when the small breakfast buffet ran out it was not replaced so there was never any hot food unless you count toast or milk for cereal the rooms are advertised as soundproof but are far from it traffic sirens screaming gangs fighting doors slamming as well as noise from other rooms could be heard all night long the area is extremely intimidating and dangerous inundated with gangs drug addicts and fighting after dark and not much nicer during the day
