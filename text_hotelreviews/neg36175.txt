the blvd sebastopol and specially the streets around the hotel were full of suspicious people just staring at walkers at all times we were walking on the blvd on saturday around pm and of them insulted my wife so i told him to leave us alone the african french then reacted like crazy and wanted to attack me fortunately there was a group of militars passing by and jumped in immediately so the guy ran away unfortunately and as in many other areas in paris the zone felt insecure at all times and needs more police presence
