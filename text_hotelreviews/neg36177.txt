on the day i checked out i asked the male staff at the front desk to help me book a taxi to the airport he said okay but i would have to pay about i asked is it for the taxi he said yes therefore i paid in cash i went back to my room to grab my luggage and head down after the staff called my room to inform me that the taxi had arrived he then gave me a sealed envelope containing my paid invoice upon arriving at the airport the taxi driver asked me to pay euro for the taxi fare and i was puzzled i told him that i already paid the front desk and he said no one gave him any money i did not want to argue further so i gave him that amount i called the hotel to explained about what happened and a woman told me that the amount i have paid was actually not meant for the taxi but the outstanding balance i owed the hotel which include breakfast on that day i checked out and a bottle of mineral water the day before i explained that i did not purchase both of them especially because i checked out at in the morning how could i have purchased breakfast the woman then asked me to write an email to them to explain my situation and they would try to refund back the amount to me i wrote and they said they would look into it weeks and emails later and still no response from them i am deeply disappointed at the service at least they could have replied back with some response
