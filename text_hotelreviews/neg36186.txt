we received twin rooms with just one bed imagine how unconfortable this is when you are in a business trip with your colleagues the solution was to give us a bigger bed which we could split but the hotel did not have bed covers for more beds temperature was in farenheit celsius we freezed in the room and with not enough blanket to cover us up the fire alarm was activated by someone smoking at am red lights and untolerable noise in the middle of the night that last for half hour not ok at the end of our trip we were charged with leads of euros with no reason none of us took anything from the bar worst pricing for what we got ever not to put a foot in this place never again
