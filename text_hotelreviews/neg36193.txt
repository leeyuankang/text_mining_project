we had a very unpleasant stay and we believe the experiences we had is unacceptable to everyone not only us we booked two rooms for three nights check in on feb check out on feb on second day when we back to hotel at night we found the bin bag with the rubbish inside were on the desk especially on top of the fruits we leave in the plate how terrible we think we are quite lucky because of the cleaner took this mistake by forgeting take the bin bag away when she change it to a new one otherwise we will eat the fruits this is the very serious hygiene issue to make us risen the complain but there are few other issues we found in three days eg dirty mop left for two days on the table of my friends room cups leave on the table without cleaning no one looks after the canteen downstairs and leave the kitchen unlocked and with the food inside when we raise the issues to the front desk manager he has no sense about how serious it is he keep explain to us he will ask the cleaning lady why she forgot take the bin bag away after she change it and we need to explain to him we will accept this mistake if she only forget the bin bag in the room but we cannot accept she leave it on the table it doesn t really matter whether there has fruits or not and we did request to see the hotel manager but she refused to see us only ask us to send her a email and we did see her sit in the office when the front desk manager spoken to her the conclusion are the hotel has very serious hygiene issues as well as healthy and safety issues the hotel management is weak and not helpful best western group doesn t have basic training management and monitoring system in place not a reliable chained brand hotel at all we are not going to stay in any of the best western hotel at all in the future
