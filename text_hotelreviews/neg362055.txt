although i had booked the hotel room weeks in advance when we arrived after a long journey and delays on the train was informed that because the hotel was fully booked i had to have a basement room the receptionist then said at least it will be quiet the room was extremely hot with no ventilation it was obviously situated close to the service entrance as we had delivery lorries and bin lorries arriving at am and late into the night most disturbingly after the first night i woke to find bites on my foot presumably from a flea or bed bug
