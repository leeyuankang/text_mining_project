i had a grilled rump steak and asked for it to be cooked medium to well done which means no blood running in the steak at all but not well done it came as a medium rare steak with the blood still running inside when cooked i didnt return it as i find when this is recooked it will only toughen up the meat so made due as it was also the rest of the meal was covered in pepper as the chips had a coating on them and the large mushroom with a half tomatoe on top had pepper put between them all i could taste was the pepper and not the food it should be a customer choice if they want pepper on there food i have worked as a butcher and chef most of my life and have a good understanding of cooking and uncooked produce i didnt complain as it is not in my nature to make a fuss apart from that it is a excellent hotel with frindly staff and worth a visit and has hyde park on its doorstep
