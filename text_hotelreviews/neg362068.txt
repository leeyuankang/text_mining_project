our rooms my friends were in a room and they described it as the worst room they had ever stayed in and they travel a bit they could not fit into the shower the room looked grubby the bed quality was poor they went to the manager and they were moved into a lovely room so were very happy with that and very happy with the room they got my room was small dated and compact the hotel air conditioning units were outside our window so very noisy and after nights very annoying we had twin beds which were too soft i could feel the springs in my one and moved when i moved in the bed
