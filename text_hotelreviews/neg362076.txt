to pay a night for what you think is a star hotel is acceptable in london however this is more like a hotel ok if your paying a night the electric went off midway through shower so had to leave hotel with wet hair my friend cold then shower or see in our room rooms are very small not cleaned properly shampoo bottles half empty etc dirty chairs and bedding this was after being moved from our first room the view overlooked the rubbish bins to which you were woken up at and by rubbish and bottles being emptied pictures are not what they seem on the website they clearly used old photos or photos of s different hotel rooms stank of cigarettes and damp not what you expect for a night on a week night staff were helpful though and said they get a lot of complaints so we re happy to refund me part of he cost needs refurbishment
