we expected the room to be small which we have come to expect in london but it was clean and efficient i thought the breakfast was typical and generous what i did not expect was to open the curtains and be looking at garbage containers and trash in an alleyway that was very unpleasant and really no hotel guest should have to view that scene we were only there for a very short stay or i would have had to request another room that view was unacceptable at any price
