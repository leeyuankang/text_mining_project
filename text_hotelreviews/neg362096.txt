the room we had was abysmal the bathroom that was so small you could not stand in front of the basin to brush your teeth because the toilet was so close you had to stand to one side couldn t regulate the temperature of the water in the shower nowhere to put anything in the bathroom you had to get dressed in the room because you can only put your clothes on the toilet there isn t anywhere else if you are a larger person you would have difficulty even getting in the bathroom the doorway was so narrow the wardrobe is a joke you can t open it because it hits the bed couldn t use the mirror they have on the inside of the wardrobe door because you can t open the door the tea coffee they must be on rations the teabags and coffee sticks and little milk pots were in a tin on a shelf had to ask for more milk and used my own teabags because i couldn t be bothered if you ordered room service they charged gbp a tray to deliver to your room needless to say we ate out this room was for all intents and purposes cheap and nasty however it was only a night cheaper than a better located and fitted out room that we had previously in another hotel should have gone back there
