the outside overall look of the hotel was really good and the reception area this is where it changes when you come out of the lift to go to your room you walk down narrow corridors with lots of shabby looking doors leading to the rooms they have crammed as many rooms as possible into this hotel it needs a total refurbishment the rooms were tiny shabby and very worn the bed was the size of a postage stamp which dipped in the middle we didn t have any sleep it was so uncomfortable the extractor fan in the toilet would not turn off which added to our sleepless night there was also constant loud noises from what looked like staff wheeling big crates back and forth at midnight a very depressing room will not be going back really spoilt our trip
