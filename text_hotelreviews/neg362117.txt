to picked this hotel because it is right at an underground transport stop unfortunately this stop is being worked on and cannot be used you either take a bus from victoria station with all your luggage good luck finding it or go to a neighboring tube stop and walk better hope it s not rainy or a taxi traffic in london is terrible
