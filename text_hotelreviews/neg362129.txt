when choosing this hotel amongst others i was a bit unclear about the reason for low rating but location was a driver for our pick we occupied a room on floor with the window overlooking the hyde park but have barely had a chance to enjoy the view since window n balcony were so dirty that was very disappointing room was a bit small but ok bathroom was also tiny with very inconvenient sink beds were too narrow can not recall when i saw last time the single beds in the hotel but small room does not allow to put wider beds so overall this hotel has very nice location attentive staff fine breakfast but some improvements would be to the benefit of the hotel i think
