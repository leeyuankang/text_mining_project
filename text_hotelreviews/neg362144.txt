i know we were next to hyde park and that getting a cheaper room will not be the best but the room was awful walls were paper thin i heard everything the next room were talking about i could hear the piano two floors down through my floor and the cleaning staff were also very noisy there was a cool breeze coming through my window as well which was supposed to be sealed the lifts are awful and as soon as you step away from the foyer the carpets were old and dated so were the facilities very disappointed as i really looked forward to my stay
