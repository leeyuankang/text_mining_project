bathroom was a total joke i could not stand up breakfast was horrible unfriendly arrogant staff room uncomfortable in deep china hotels are better ridiculously expensive for such low value i belief i paid euros including breakfast how could i be so stupid as i had stayed in the hotel before so i should have remembered i normally stay in park grand costs lot less friendly staff and comfortable rooms great breakfast never ever go this hotel this kind of hotel should not exist the only reason it is still there because so many people come to london and they can get away with this kind of lousy service they are not the only ones in london i am afraid
