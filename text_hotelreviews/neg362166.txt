the staff upon first entry didnt seem to have a clue we arrived at main reception and asked if there was any type of parking as online it said there was on street we were quickly told to speak to concierge staff and rushed along to find out we had to pay a further for parking around the corner or pay until and move it every four hours not a great start anyway greeted by a really lovely trainee after the mins of faffing sorting our parking out and walking back to hotel the male on reception taught her how to sort our booking they took a down payment on a card and then gave us our room keys our room was we walked to the lifts and saw signs that said rooms can t remember exact numbers were this way no sign of after feeling like a right tool having to ask where it was they told us we had to go up in the lift so we set off to the lift to hop in and go up to our room once again there were no numbers other than floor numbers in the lift so we went back again and on the fourth time at the desk they finally told us how to get to our room arrived in our executive double room to find that the bottle of bubbly i had requested also said id pay extra for if required wasn t there we also discovered that the shower drain was blocked and rather dingy we also found our bed to be a cheap clip together on wheels bed yes the sheets duvet and pillows were nice but for i expect a bed that doesn t roll away from the headboard anyway the room was cleanish nasty view of the back of the next hotel though can t change the view in london but when you pay for a room thats supposed to be the best there you d like to see hyde park or the nice front streets not poorly made bitchumen roofs and leaking lead flashing i would of paid only for this room
