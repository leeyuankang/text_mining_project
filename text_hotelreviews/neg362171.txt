the check in was very upsetting the woman who checked me in was very rude and tried to overcharge me for the room while the overcharging could be explained by a misunderstanding i felt her attitude to a client checking in was disgraceful i complained about this on checking out and the other staff were very embarrassed and apologised on behalf of the hotel
