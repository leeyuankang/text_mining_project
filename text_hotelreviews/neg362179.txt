cold dirty small tired noisy this was the worst hotel weve ever stayed in outside is very deceiving to inside the room was tiny with a very small double bed the room was that small the bed was against the wall not ideal for people at all the windows let in a massive draft of which i am now poorly that s to been freezing through the nights we stayed the room was very noisy it was like there was no windows at all so we didn t get much sleep the bedding was dirty the bathroom was a joke you couldn t even stand in shower because they had build it within a wall that stuck out so every time you tried to wash your hair u hit your head the bath was too small unless you was less than walls like paper so heard noisy neighbours feel absolutely ripped off not worth half what we paid when i complained and asked to move got told we had to pay to move no thanks you ve already got enough of our money never returning
