shabby room the shower was too hot and it was impossible to adjust the temperature a mere look at the air filter in the bathroom was shocking it was so filthy we arrived close to midnight and asked the hotel staff to provide us with plug adapters so that we would be able to charge our phones they basically sent us off with this request telling that they do not provide this service and recommended to go shopping luckily we did not take the breakfast option as we would have had experienced a waiting line of about half an hour to get a table way far from a star quality
