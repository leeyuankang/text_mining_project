we had a few problems on our stay and the main one being told that as the bar was still open they wouldn t do beer on room service i am still waiting to hear from the hotel on this matter so whilst my score may appear high overall i was disappointed with my stay here especially given the cost i have stayed in cheaper hotels and received better service
