room was too small my partner had to climb over me to get out of bed we kept bagging our legs on the leg of the bed no hot water in shower only tepid water came out of the shower head and even then it trickled out so we couldn t shower on cold the pressure was fine the knob on the shower was broken for a star hotel to have such a small room and with no hot water in the shower is shocking value for money
