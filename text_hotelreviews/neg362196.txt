the lounge area is very poor more like a corridor with some seats in the only section that is quite good is the little alcove by the piano we needed lounge facilities because we were with a family member who was staying in another room we were asked to move at pm and had to take our drinks to the seats in the corridor this was so the two men could set up for breakfast disgraceful this should be done during the night so as not to disrupt the enjoyment of guests we decided not to order another bottle of wine and went back to our room and made tea
