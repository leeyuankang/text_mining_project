breakfast staff not sure what strong tea should look like and i don t believe i had decaf coffee allergic to caffeine and felt sick within min of drinking coffee hotel should have good decaf or individual filter decaf pastries cold and a bit stale in texture would be better warmed throughout the breakfast time
