the room thermostat was set to degrees c when i arrived at midnight it was like walking into the tropics opening the window and adjusting the controls sorted this out in minutes bathroom light switch gave a green glow to the room the room is next to the lift so the words going down doors closing filtered into the room luckily i was tired anyway so slept well despite this bit of extractor fan noise from outside but not too bad good value for money though
