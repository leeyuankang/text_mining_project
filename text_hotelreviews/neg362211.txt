for a star hotel and the price the size of the room was a disgrace we could hardly move the supposedly double bed was only a three quarter bed and way too small and uncomfortable no room to move in the tiny room the expensive breakfast was not up to a star hotel standard great little cafes around where you can get the same breakfast for a fraction of the price
