the family room was just a standard room with an extra single bed in it was a little cramped the decor dated no luxurious feel to the room which was dissapointing as the exterior and reception areas are lovely the worst bit was the shower in the tiny dated bathroom it literally trickled out of the shower head making showering a really cold unpleasant experience not what i would expect for per night
