the elevators wouldn t work they had some issue with them and you had to press the button of one elevator to call the other the check in was really really bad we got to the hotel at am and had requested early check in they agreed prior to our arrival that they would provide early check in but when we got there they refused its okay we thought but our room wasnt ready till with a baby that was an exhausting waiting time our room which was a family room had no fridge it was small so please go with very low expectations the location makes up for all these issues so do consider this as an option
