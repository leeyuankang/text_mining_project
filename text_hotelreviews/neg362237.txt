breakfast was not included in the room rate and cost more than my breakfast allowance so i had to skip it the view from the window was of a yard filled with rubbish bins the window was single glazing there were several air conditioning units on the next building a few metres away which gave a consistent loud hum all through the night leading to two nights of suboptimal sleep
