that woman at desk my husband is diabetic and insulin dependent and needs a refrigerator for his medicine and necessary food otherwise he will die so it s not frivolous we were guaranteed the fridge when we booked months prior but the lady was rude and said there is no fridge and acted as if it was not a necessity we book a week in aug sept every year and we have been loyal since we have always been guaranteed a fridge otherwise we d book elsewhere she said we wouldn t get one and made it seem impossible so i asked for the manager who was actually lovely and got us our fridge next time i d appreciate some yes we can attitude from the front desk instead of making us feel as if it s a lot to request for someone with a life threatening disease ps the carpet in our room was filthy wasn t in the new section of hotel
