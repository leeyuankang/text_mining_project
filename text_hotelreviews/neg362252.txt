we paid nearly four hundred pounds for three nights in a so called star hotel it felt more like a two star our room was small no fridge very small tv very basic tea coffee utilities very basic furnishings and a very small bathroom nowhere to put anything and the only place to hang anything was a hook at the top of the door which we couldn t reach we were there to go to hyde park for both sat sun shows we ask the front of house if they could look after a few things for us in their fridges but we where told that they only had a very small fridge in their kitchen and couldn t help us but they could only put a bit of our stuff in a tiny fridge they had at reception we have been coming to these gigs for over nine years always staying in a two star hotels they all had bigger fridges but we thought we would treat ourselves to a four star to be spoilt for once our mistake
