that the car parking that was offered on the internet at the time of booking was very misleading there was only room for approximately six cars directly in front of the hotel our room was very small dated not what i thought i had booked as a surprise for my husbands birthday and our view out of the window was onto air conditioning units and back doors of the hotel which was extremely noisy due to being only single glazed no view at all
