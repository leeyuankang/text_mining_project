we went to the bar after we returned to the hotel one night we did not use table service but got our drinks from the bar and they put a service charge on we did not notice but another guest had noticed and several people then went and asked for it to be refunded which they got so the bar staff clearly knew it was wrong very cheeky and under hand as one of the other guest said it was not the money it is the principle don t like being treated like a mug and ripped off it tarnished the stay
