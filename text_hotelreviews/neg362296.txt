besides a generally pleasant stay one specific incident of poor staff curtesy stained my entire visit upon noticing that i had misplaced my credit card i sought the help of the hotel s security liaison who had very poor bedside manners and gave the notion of doing the absolute minimum required sadly since filing the report over two weeks ago i have yet to have heard back from the hotel clearly i don t place any fault at the direction of the hotel for misplacing my credit card however i would except that such an important issue be met with at least some form of response from the hotel no sorry sir but we weren t able to find your card or anything of that sort seeing as my credit card company will obviously call the hotel to inquire the matter i would have expected to receive some form of response directly from the hotel without having to wait for my credit card company to get involved this unfortunate experience made me i extremely disappointed in the hotel s service as i expect that i will not choose to stay at this hotel a second time
