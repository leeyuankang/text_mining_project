rates we booked via internet were not the rates that we paid we paid much higher rate the staff in general are not good almost to the point of impolite we had many arguments about breakfast booking payments incorrect allocation of room we extended the stay by one day as we had no choice due to flight changes etc and this proved to be a mission wete again overcharged by far for this additional day then when we got back to the hotel in the evening they had no record of our extension so we had to do it all again and pay again it appears the hotel management is not on top of their game room was not completely cleaned dirty glasses left unwashed etc we have stayed at the corus many times before but after this escapade will never return here again
