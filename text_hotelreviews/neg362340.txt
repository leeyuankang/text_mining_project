we were put in an economy double room at the same cost as the other room we had booked for our daughter she was put in a standard twin room but this was sufficient in theory given that it was a one night stay for a concert however the shower was broken the thermostat would not adjust and the water was literally scalding hot and so impossible to use because these rooms have only a tiny hand washing basin you couldn t even use that to wash in instead the hotel were clearly aware of an issue because the front of the shower adjustment knob had obviously been removed previously in an attempt to rectify the problem thankfully in our case we were able to go to our daughter s room two floors below to use her shower but that s immaterial given that we had paid the same rate for a room which had no washing facilities in effect if we hadn t booked a second room we would have been stuck which was pretty unsatisfactory especially as it was a hot and humid weekend although the staff were very apologetic no offer of recompense was made only one mug and one tea bag were provided economy pushed a step too far i think i should also mention that the shower in our daughter s standard room was extremely limited in head height she is and couldn t stand up straight would we stay again for location yes but for the room and rate no
