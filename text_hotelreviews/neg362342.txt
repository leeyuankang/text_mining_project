the room was quite dark and small for a twin room we had a fire alarm go off on the sunday morning which was not a practice exercise we evacuated to the outside of the hotel and there seemed no order or management or staff ensuring all guests were evacuated and no head count was carried out we were just left in the street until a member of staff came out and said via a loud speaker who said that we could all go back in i noticed other guests looking out of their bedroom windows who did not evacuate the hotel whilst we were all waiting to see if there was a real fire or emergency on the street as per hotel fire regulations and procedure better organisation would and should be addressed given the circumstances and security advice we are advised to take in london
