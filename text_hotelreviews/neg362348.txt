top floor was fine but lifts were slow room was small but it did the job however the bath sink shower arrangement doesn t work rip out the bath and the sticky taps and plugs this will give more room for a decent shower breakfast was a disappointment why is a poached egg like rubber staff to clear a handful of tables at breakfast plus the chef i would say a little over heavily staffed and so not needed carpet in dining areas needs replacing another guest was told off for opening a window all a bit embarrassing really i could not understand one of the waiters who appeared to struggle to speak i asked him twice to repeat and after the third attempt i gave up and ignored whatever he was trying to say i may have appeared rude but i could not understand him on top floor could still hear road noise so not a quiet night
