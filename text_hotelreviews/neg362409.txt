the bed was lumpy the room was small and poorly designed there were no drawers to put clothes water came up in the tub when the neighbors emptied their tub the worst part was the fire alarm that went off in the middle of the night no explanations or apologies were offered the next day i found this very unprofessional false alarms can happen but at least apologize and offer some kind of explanation
