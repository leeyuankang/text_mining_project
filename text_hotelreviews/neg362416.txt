the view we had was of a wall if we stood on our toes we could see some sky the bathroom was nice but the water preasure in the room was terrible and only just enought to wash off any shampoo or soap that you d put on even the preasure in the taps was very poor wasn t to keen on the housekeeping staff that decided to knock the door at just gone to ask when we were leaving even though it was a mid day checkout otherwise it did what it said on the tin and gave us somewhere to sleep and not to expesive either
