i would not recommend staying there overpriced the walls are thin you can hear everything that is going on in your neighbours rooms and bathrooms and when someone is in the corridor around every morning we were woken because of the traffic outside not a street facing room with vendors coming in with supplies and also people walking with their suitcases the rooms are small poorly decorated and not star worthy no storage in the bathroom problems with plumbing the toilet barely flushed and after taking a bath the drainage broke for two people staying in the room toiletries were only for one important if you are travelling with hand luggage the slowest elevator i have ever been in there was a lingering smell in the whole hotel of some kind of cleaning product that reminded me of a pool but there was no pool during our check out noone seemed to be interested if we enjoyed our stay
