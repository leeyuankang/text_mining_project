we were on aware the exterior was under renovation so the whole of the outside of the hotel had scaffolding up we and our friends had the smallest bedrooms imaginable barely foot across the bed was squashed against a wall which meant one of us had to climb over the other to get in or out the tiniest ensuite barely larger than a cupboard with bifold doors on the smallest shower i have ever seen anyone above average size would not be able to get into it at breakfast despite asking for toast twice having seen all the other tables being given it we were brought some mins later as we got up to leave also the tables were so close together you could not avoid pushing part of your anatomy in somebody s face as you tried to get to the food
