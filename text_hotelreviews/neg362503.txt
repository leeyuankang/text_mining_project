i was taken aback by the size of the room i have seen larger cupboards the room itself was shabby and the shower room toilet was impossibly small to share the bed was wedged into the room meaning there was no room to get out of bed on one side we had no time to complain or request a room change as the queues at reception on our way out were considerable not a good experience at all the public areas of the hotel were ok but the room was not value for money at all
