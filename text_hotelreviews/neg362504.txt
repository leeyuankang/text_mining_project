we were in london for a close friends wedding at lancaster gate hence we chose to stay at this hotel we quickly checked into our room at lunchtime on saturday and was taken aback by the size of the room we have seen larger cupboards the room itself was shabby and the shower room toilet was impossibly small to share the bed was wedged into the room meaning there was no room to get out of bed on one side we had no time to complain or request a room change as the queues at reception on our way out were considerable in the morning when trying to make a cup of tea both cartons of milk i selected were sour hence no morning tea we quickly got our things together and left much earlier than we had planned not a good experience at all the public areas of the hotel were ok but the room was not value for money at all it may be suitable for a single occupant but certainly not for a couple sharing we understood they had signs throughout the hotel regarding refurbishment but this does not affect the issues we will raise with the hotel
