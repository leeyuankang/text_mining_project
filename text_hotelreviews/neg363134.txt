not sure where to start the hotel from the outside looked lovely reception looked nice staff ok we had heavy luggage and were advised to use the lift you were lucky if you can fit a suitcase in this lift it was the size of a single wardrobe the room was outdated no air con no batteries in remote control no tea bags and one milk for two we have travelled and stayed in many places this has to be by far the worst very over priced for what was there we certainly did not want to stay for breakfast
