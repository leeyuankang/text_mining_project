the room was uncomfortably hot and we were not able to sleep all night i had expected an air conditioned room in a four star hotel in fact there was a small ceiling fan providing some air to the feet of the bed beds were too small the carpets were old and seem unclean the breakfast was the worst i have seen from all the hotels booked to booking com the continental breakfast offered some cereals apples boiled egg and cold toasts i will write to you separately requesting for refund because the hotel was not in my opinion a four star accommodation there were at least two guests i met who very upset about the poor the quality of service i requested a table fan during the night because i was unable to sleep but there were none available it appears that even for the guests who have air conditioned rooms the air conditioning has malfunctioned i believe that considering that this was rated as four star it should have been made clear to the guests that in the heat of the summer no air conditioned rooms will be available i would rate our stay at this hotel is the worst experience ever
