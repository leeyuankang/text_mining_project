first gripe the tiny lift my daughter refused point blank to get in it with me and our two suitcases to be fair it would have been a tight squeeze we actually only ever used it going up to our room on the third floor with shopping we always came down on the stairs but it is vital for those checking out for bringing heavy luggage down to reception i found that in the mornings it was often blocked with individual guests using it to go down for breakfast while other guests were left waiting on landings with luggage second gripe breakfast breakfast was included in the deal i got for our stay so this gripe is not personal and to be honest we decided beforehand to have breakfast each day on our way to whatever attraction we had planned most in london open at the hotel breakfast is a continental one and this is advertised as such the dining area is small and there is an obvious rush hour at peak times so i would be very annoyed if i actually had to pay for it i would go down between and and just take an orange juice and coffee to the bar to read the news online many times there were people complaining about the wait to get tables or the lack of food when they got there when in london you are never far away from a proper english breakfast for a very reasonable price location was what sold this hotel to me
