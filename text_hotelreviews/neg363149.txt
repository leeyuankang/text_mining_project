poor staff relations at reception and at breakfast room dull dated floor not level particularly in bathroom complimentary tea coffee making items not adequate nor replaced on second day breakfast very basic eg basket of cold toast fresh fruit wrinkled and some showing rot tea in a large thermos tasted of coffee overall no value for money sentiment shared by many guests we were very disappointed with our choice of this property for our last two nights of a wonderful day uk holiday
