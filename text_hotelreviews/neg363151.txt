they did not inform about a major renovation of the roads just outside of the hotel with a number of heavy machines starting unnecessary early their work and making it impossible to sleep any longer and certainly difficult to work from the room during daytime on top of this they did not inform that the tube station lancaster gate very close to the hotel and the main reason for me to choose the hotel was closed for renovation and had been since january booking com and the hotel could easily have informed of these important facts and thereby avoided dissatiesfied customers trust in the booking com service build up over years of positive use is easily eroded in such instances i asked for a rebate but was denied they did change my room to the back side though i asked for them to cancel and refund the second of two nights but was denied this as well
