extremely uncaring and conceited staff apart from one girl the receptionist meeting us kept measuring us up and we didn t feel welcome at all once we d entered the hotel corridors we realized they ve put all their money into the lobby the hotel corridors where extremely narrow the lift only fitted one normal size person and one suitcase or two normal sized people the further we went into the hotel the shabbier it got a damp smell of mold caused headaches and it wasn t exactly inviting to a good night sleep some paint might have covered up some of the worst parts but again they d probably just repaint the lobby instead though i doubt it would cover up dodgy and badly kept corridors floors and walls we ve booked a room with one double bed and a single bed family of but received a room with two single beds and an extra bed we decided to stay after all as we where very tired in the middle of the night we were woken up by a dripping sound and saw water coming down from the ceiling this would explain the very bumpy and uneven floor i suspect the bathroom above us had a leak and probably not for the first time my husband but a bin under it and rushed down to the reception to let them know it was a leak and all they did was to hand him the key to the room next door no assistance in getting us there no rushing to fix the room and no staff coming to ask if we were installed alright in the new room even worse the snotty receptionist didn t mention this when checking out no apology or even acknowledgment when we told her that we would check out from a different room than the one we checked out from and we told her kindly why oh ok was all we got the breakfast is a different story simple continental breakfast with more cakes than food bad coffee and the self service bar was put in a narrow hallway not big enough for two to serve themselves at the time do not get fooled by the pictures
