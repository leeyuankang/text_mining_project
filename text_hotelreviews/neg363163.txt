rooms were very noisy we could loudly hear the traffic outside our neighbors and when someone was walking upstairs the first family room we had was very run down the next room we got was slightly better but still very dated the shower barely worked in our first room the carpets were dirty the outside of the hotel as well as the reception looks very nice but once inside the corridors and the rooms everything is very run downed and dated this hotel is in dire need of a complete makeover i guess this is a very typical victorian london hotel
