the wifi was very slow and the hotel furnishings fixtures etc was quite old and a bit shabby also the window in my room was letting in a bit of a draft and the heat didn t work one night of my stay but they did apologize for this admittedly i should have reported it as soon as i realized it instead i kept waiting and waiting for it to kick on and it didn t and i just went to sleep the continental breakfast wasn t stellar i ended up just eating a bowl of cereal both mornings but this is par for the course warning you have to leave your room key when you leave the hotel and when i came back one afternoon i accidentally asked for the wrong room key i was room and i asked for by mistake it was given to me no questions asked no form of id or checks whatsoever were required to get the room key and i could ve gone into that wrong room and stolen something i realized quite quickly before going into the wrong room that i didn t have my own key and got the right one but it made me very uncomfortable to think that someone could have done the same thing to my room and stolen my things
