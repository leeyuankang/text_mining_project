the continental breakfast is quite poor althoug the staff is very attentive the choice for breakfast is not big unless you count cake and tarts as breakfast too the bar on the ground floor looks more like a provisional solution and the choice of drinks is quite small some more comfortable sofas would change already the whole ambience the water pressure in the shower on the floor is quite weak
