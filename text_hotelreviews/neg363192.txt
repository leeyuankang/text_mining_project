hotel was dirty and very poorly maintained the staff were rude and the reception was not aware of the details of our booking nobody helped us with our luggage or offered to at any point both breakfast and dinner were poor at best we had taken an offer for person for dinner they offered us their ala cart dinner which was advertised at person at the hotel needless to say i felt cheated definitely not staying there again
