i ve never been so desperate to write a hotel review until after the stay at this hotel the room we were given is on basement level facing the busy street it s so noisy and we can t even sleep after midnight the bathroom seems a million years old and there are cracks on the tile there s basically no ventilation as if you open the window it will be even more noisy and will probably be the same as living on the street there s roof fan but you will not want to use it unless you want to increase the noisy level choosing this hotel is definitely the worst choice that i ve made since day when i started using booking com there s basically nothing to eat at breakfast should ve stayed in a chain hotel as it won t go very wrong absolutely hated it
