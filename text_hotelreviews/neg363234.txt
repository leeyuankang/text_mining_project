breakfast choices were poor no toaster no meats no cheese just hard boiled eggs in shells dry bread and bizarrely tomato and cucumber slices coffee was bitter no orange juice some dry croissants then some strange pizza squares with little filling on them fruit salad was mostly apple we didn t complain as overall location wins breakfast servers did seem half asleep though
