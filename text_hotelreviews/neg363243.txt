staff did not speak english well enough the room was terrible with broken windows damp patches the grout on the bathroom floor was broken up and missing lots of traffic noise due to the broken windows and to top it off when we woke in the morning there was water running down the wall from the room above lastly the breakfast was toast will boiled eggs but no egg cups for the eggs
