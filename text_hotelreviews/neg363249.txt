your site rated it star and i doubt that unless the star rating system is different in uk a historic monument style hotel which is okay the really small room bearable but the bath toilet is just a box with no elbow room the tub meant for kids not an adult broken tiles on the floor soap scum on the curtains the free breakfast is just oats boiled eggs and bread everyday unless you pay and order more off their menu
