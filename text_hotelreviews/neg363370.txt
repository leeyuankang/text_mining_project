the bar fridge was connected to reception and if you moved anything of picked it up for more than seconds it was charged on the bill and it mounted up to quite a lot of money and did take a fair while to have it sorted out on checkout and taken off the bill if you were in a hurry to check out this could be a problem next time i will ask them to remove everything and just put my own drinks wine in it the hotel was still in the process of the renovations but they did not start work until so it did not bother us
