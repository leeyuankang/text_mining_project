this was a birthday treat for me completed by a booking at the on site thai restaurant although refurbishment works had been mentioned in the small print i hadn t been aware of the extent of these works my addison lee cab had to drive around for to find the alternative entrance on checking in i was told the lifts weren t working and i d have to go up to my room in the goods lift my partner and i had a great meal at the restaurant however we were then woken up by the fire alarm at we both live outside london and work in london and had booked this hotel so we wouldn t have to cut short my birthday meal to get back home and actually have a lie in until for once so being woken up at by a screaming fire alarm wasn t a great thing particularly as it went off a few times after the initial burst we ended up leaving and going to work early this hotel will undoubtedly be great once the refurbishment is completed but for without breakfast this was disappointing
