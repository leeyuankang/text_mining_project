the hotel is currently being refurbished and they have only two very small and highly unreliable lifts out of the original four running you wait a very long time but with lots of luggage the stairs are not an option the room was very bijou small a single shot of brandy at the bar cost plus a service charge of for pouring it ouch the doorman was never there when we were moving in and out with luggage etc lancaster gate tube station is immediately adjacent but closed for renovations and refurbishment currently there s a moderate amount of building noise to contend with during the days but it was not too intrusive in our area of the hotel
