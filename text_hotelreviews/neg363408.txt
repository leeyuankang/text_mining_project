in my request i had asked for an extra bed in the room at arrival the extra bed hadn t been provided even worse the room was actually too small to put an extra bed the only option was to take an extra room for an additional gbp per night and this despite my written advance request the breakfast is relatively low value for money as the options are really no longer up to date for an increasingly healthy focused travelling community
