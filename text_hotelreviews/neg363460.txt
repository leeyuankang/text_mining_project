booked a superior twin room offered a room at check in which smelt strongly of cigarettes which was totally unacceptable we then had to wait over an hour for another room to be ready would have been nice to be offered a complimentary tea or coffee instead of which had to pay the hot water in the shower was difficult to control glad i didn t book an ordinary room
