very expensive upgrade for a park view room that you could definitely not see a park from maybe if you could see through the trees or swing a cat in tiny one bottle of complimentary water other small bottles for each in mini bar not enough little milk cartons for more than one cuppa each hairdryer not working they did eventually bring a plug in one phone hanging by a thread off the wall in the bathroom great location so guess thats what you pay for but not worth the upgrade
