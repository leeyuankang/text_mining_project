we had a basin in our room we couldn t use it was obviously like it before we arrived as the taps had been turned off so hard it was almost impossible to turn them on when my husband eventually got them on we couldn t get them off so they were permanently running my husband had to shut them which was so difficult we never opened them again an absolute pain trying to wash our hands and brush our teeth using the bath didn t have time to complain but the room cleaner obviously was aware of it apart from that everything else was fine
