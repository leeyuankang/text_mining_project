i booked twin rooms and requested to be next to or close to each other i requested an early check in and got neither i sent emails about early check and got no reply turned up just after to be told they had not received my e mails we had one room on floor and one on floor so nowhere near each other and our room was a double not a twin which was put right but along with the other two disappointments it was not a great start to our stay
