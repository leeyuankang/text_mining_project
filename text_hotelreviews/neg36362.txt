where do we start very disappointed after staying here a few years ago staff had no idea when asked about london twice sent us on a wild goose chase to nowhere they all seemed to be from europe had no idea about london keys to room deactivated every night staff kept blaming us when they worked all day other guests had same problem rooms were extremely ordinary for the price the pillows were disgusting they were all so old i would have put them in my dog kennels at home they were that bad we stayed for nights requested new one s but they were just as bad hotel is very tired for the price only good thing about this hotel is the location but stay around the corner google it as there is a better hotel overlooking the river around the corner worth paying an extra few dollars
