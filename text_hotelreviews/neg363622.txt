the curtains were pulled off the runners there was no hot water when we came to get ready to go out on saturday night and the shower was loose on the wall this was a superior room the grill room and the park breakfast room were all very cold too much use of the air conditioning one lady sat having her meal with a coat round her shoulders that should have given the staff a clue i did ask for it to be turned off they said they would but it never happened we think it is on for the staff why when you are sat having a meal do management staff think you want to be freezing cold you wouldn t have it like that in your own dining rooms at home
