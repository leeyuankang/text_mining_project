we thought we were getting a suite but ended up with a large room with a sofa in it the bathroom was very small there wasn t a lot of pictures on their web site and it never even displayed the suite so this is why we thought we had one paying for the most expensive room it just wasn t set clear what you were getting i have tried to book the suite for next year but it is not displayed again on any date i tired so we will go somewhere else next year
