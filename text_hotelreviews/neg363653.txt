the rooms on that particular floor seemed to be a combination of options for non smokers and smokers unfortunately it was unpleasant to smell cigarette smoke on few occasions and probably with booking i would like to make sure this could be excluded placement of sockets to arrange ironing was more than tricky and it would be expected to have an easy access to a socket where the ironing desk is kept in the cupboard not on the other side of the room where you have to fight with space between a chair desk bed and personal belongings little practical issues also lack of bottled water per room as a part of catering we found to be under standard for this class of hotel luckily we had own arrangements to refresh ourselves after a long journey
