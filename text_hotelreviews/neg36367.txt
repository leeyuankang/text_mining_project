no slippers provided even if you request and the bathrooms for my room the toilet seat and shower are in two separate washrooms so to wash your hands after using the toilet you have to come out and go to the other bathroom for me this was very inconvenient and unhygienic added to this they were very small and there s not enough hooks to keep your clothes
