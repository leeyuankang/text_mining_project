the new bathroom facilities in the room when travelling with friends or family having the all glass walls were uncomfortable upon check in i was told we have you in a beautiful renovated room with a view of the london eye yes newly renovated but our view of the london eye was less then a quarter of the attraction over the top of roofs best seen at night when it was lit this was disappointing especially after being told i would have a view when i checked in
