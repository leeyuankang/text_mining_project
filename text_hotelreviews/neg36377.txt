the first room we had was designated as a family room although the sink was right in the middle of it and the walk in shower was separated by partly transparent mirrored door without the possibility to leave your clothes inside so it was almost impossible to have a shower when the child is in the room we asked for a replacement and fortunately the staff were ready to help everything was much better when we got a room with a decent bathroom
