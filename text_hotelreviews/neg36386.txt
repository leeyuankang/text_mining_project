the bed was so hard my husband left in the middle of the night to another hotel the door keys kept stopping working frustrating when travelling with a baby the bathroom wall is glass why on arrival we were stopped in the middle of the lobby so they could check us in with a tablet apparently this is supposed to be more intimate but is actually both impractical and annoying had to change rooms because we were out next to a room that was being renovated
