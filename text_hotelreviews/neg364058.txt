there was only one kind of empty pillow was not very comfortable to sleep on the second day i have put one towel on the floor and expected it to be changed was disappointed when saw that cleaning staff has smashed it and put it back on shelf the room cleaning was not done accurately and properly but have to mention that after my call to reception they immediately brought me new towels
