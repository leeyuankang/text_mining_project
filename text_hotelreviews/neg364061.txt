dirty room carpet with stains chairs with stains dirty windows awful smell of cigarettes air conditioning didn t work at all and even if it was may it was very hot inside hotel is next to the crowded street so if air conditioning didn t work we couldn t open noise cancelling windows because there was ultra noisy outside defective shower switch power supply sockets were only on the same wall as tv it means if you want to connect your laptop charger you will have to take some extension cord some of electrical connections in the room were unprofessionally made which also isn t very safe please see the photo of stars hotel fridge connection which i added below cleaning staff sometimes forgot to close the room leaving the door opened we had such situation so please check twice everything you left there if you go to a hotel where standard price without a discount for a double room per night is over euro then i think this hotel should have free parking for visitors in this hotel you have to remember there is an additional euro fee for parking per every the parking i mentioned is ultra small if you have a longer than car then don t think about using this parking there is a deg corner on the way to the parking slot and it is quite narrow peugeot sedan got in but there was so tight that there was no space for a finger getting out was a lot easier to sum up in poland this hotel in current condition would have problems with getting stars the quality you get is way too low for the price you pay i think this points in ranking on booking com is in some way faked maybe would be ok and even great breakfast nice staff didn t really change our feeling of wasting of money
