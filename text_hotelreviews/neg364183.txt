overall the stay was fine for after all we only needed the place for one night the ladies at the desk were pleasant and helpful when we checked in in the morning i asked a person at the front desk to please get us a taxi to the airport which he proceeded to do and it arrived in less than minutes great the airport is from the hotel and linked directly to it via the highway and it took less than minutes to get there fine but he charged us euros wow we took other taxis in vienna and budapest and prague but not at these prices now i can not blame best western for this but i would advise all bw amedia guests do not have the front desk call you taxi better just go out and hail a cab any cab it will be way cheaper
