some of the reception staff were more helpful than others one of the female receptionists was most unhelpful and did not look like she wanted to help us either we had an issue with a tour we had booked to salzburg when asking for help all she did was pass us a booklet to ring the tour company ourself we did however get more helpful receptionists in the morning that were more helpful and actually rang the tour company for us to help us sort out our issue overall if the staff were nicer i would have rated this hotel much higher also one other little thing is that they did not provide slippers to use in the room this would have been a nice touch and would have been a good icing on the cake
