the staff as soon as i walked in the woman at the desk wasn t friendly when i left and needed help finding the bus station i wish the person who helped me would have told me i could walk minutes to the train and then take it two stops i ended up missing an earlier bus to my next destination because i didn t think i would make it in time i found out on my own that it was two stops on the train or rather u bahn customer service is everything and it would be nice if the staff was friendlier and more helpful
