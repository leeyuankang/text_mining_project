i hated the location as it was far from many things on foot and the rooms were not very clean though not the worst my first room had a terrible odor though the lady at the desk was very kind and upgraded me to a better room upon checkout the staff charged my credit card though i requested to pay in cash i will not recover a refund to my card for two weeks i do not think i will return to this hotel on my next stay
