wardrobe with a curtain without any doors strange for an ib s hotel it was more like stars toiletries and slippers may be expected for a star hotel they say we should ask reception for toiletries in the hotel booklet it says water and tea are complimentary every day but they never replaced our empty water bottle also sometimes she didn t wash our cups and glasses very poor hair drying facility is too much for a breakfast in wien and we didn t buy it as you can make a nice breakfast even in demel cafe for the same price
