our room wasn t the one we had booked we had booked a queen room with double sofa bed we got a very small room with a double bed which we had to ask to be split staff were very prompt to attend although there was lots of choice the cooked breakfast was cold the bacon and sausage weren t appetising they looked as though they had been barely cooked not great value for almost per head
