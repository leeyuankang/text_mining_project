the first room we were given was awful we were three friends travelling and had booked a triple room the second bed was a sofa bed which was unusable the mattress was less than inches thick and the springs could be felt through the duvet the only solution we were given was an offer of extra duvets until i asked to speak to the manager who then found a room change for us
