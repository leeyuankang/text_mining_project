the danger of theft is enough to put anyone off i was really shocked by the standard of security at novotel considering it is a four star hotel we placed all our valuables in our luggage and locked it before we left our room there was a safe in the room but we thought that our measures were enough this is novotel and our luggage is locked plus the door should have been securely locked as well when we came back we found our luggage zip broken and all the items inside thrown out with all our cash inside stolen we immediately notified the manager at the reception who sent a technician up to check the card access records on our door both of them affirmed that burglaries are rather rare at the hotel and because of that they are inexperienced with dealing such things according to them there was nothing suspicious regarding the entry records and called for the police to handle the matter in fact when we met with the police the next day the officer in charge told us the exact opposite of what they said apparently it was not the first time this has happened at this particular hotel many times in fact and they are investigating the issue seriously right now after going through the access records we found out that there was another card which did not belong to us which was used to enter the room according to the police there was a request for replacing for a lost card when we were not even in the hotel at that time it is outrageous to think that anyone can waltz up to the reception and ask for a replacement card so easily we are currently still corresponding with the police regarding this issue the hotel staff was rather cavalier about the whole issue no one came the day after the burglary to speak to us about it nor did they offer any further help we had to go to them ourselves to remind them we need to check out later due to the investigation we are not pleased with the manner the hotel handled this situation
