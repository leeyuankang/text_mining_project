my first impression about this hotel was spoiled at the reception when checking in the staff was polite however the policy of the hotel seems over commercial at the moment of checking in when you are tired and all you want is get in the room you have booked they provide you with a numer of offers first they offer you a special offer for breakfast then there comes offer to become a meber come on how can i decide to become a member at this point in time if i haven t even seen my room then there is an offer for a meal in the restaurant a bit too much then they explain that they reserve more money from your card in case you damage something or use extra services i would recommend the hotel to shorten the amount of information given at the check in wifi worked well but logging in was again in a special procedure and therefore longer than usually the room was quite dark walk to the city center is a bit too long better use metro for getting around the city the closest metro station is short walk away
