it is not easy to access the hotel from the main street especially if you have luggage the pathway leading to the hotel is long and bumpy expect to loose the wheels of your luggage the first room that we were offered was on the floor it was nice but with inefficient a c so we changed it with another one on the floor the water pressure in the shower was weak and the tub s sink was partially blocked guests have to walk long ways to reach from the lifts to to the rooms blankets are very thin and uncomfortable
