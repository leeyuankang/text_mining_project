the cleaning of the room was terrible by the end of our stay there had been no attempt to dust the room we wrote our name in the dust on the desk shelf no cleaning of the bathroom floor at alll you get one bottle of water on arrival and no more even though we were there for eleven days there was no provision for supper on christmas eve you had to have the supper or go without all restaurants in town were closed we could not get a light bar snack nor room service i am sure the same situation existed for new year s eve but we bought in snacks so we were protected from being ripped off
