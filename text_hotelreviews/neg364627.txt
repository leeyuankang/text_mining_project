there were two things i did not particularly like about this hotel first one was that they blocked from my bank account in case my credit card was fraud i believe that almost per night in a star hotel should get me a better treatment than you might be a thief so just in case we re blocking money from your account without even telling me about it it would probably be okay if they told me in advance and did it diplomaticaly not that i had to find out for myself the staff should also refrain from telling me that it is because i might be a fraud second inconvenience was the small breakfast restaurant some people had to wait in a rather long line for it in the morning
