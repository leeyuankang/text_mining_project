the room was very small and very award bathroom was so old and white tiles were brown and corners were looking scary old look where you had the feeling is is clean or is this because it is very old the bed was put directly on the wall where you need to go around the bed to get in to first time ever i saw something awkward like this the furniture was just put there without any taste somehow somewhere when you enter the room you feel like oh nooo but i stayed one night and didn t want to bother just passed that one day
