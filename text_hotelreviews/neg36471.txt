the price of the breakfast if not included in room price is very expensive approx for it was not possible to have just a light breakfast for less the room was at times excessively hot and could not get the air conditioning system to work finally the booking detailed a double sofa bed but the bed was actually a very narrow single this needs to be clearly stated in the room description
