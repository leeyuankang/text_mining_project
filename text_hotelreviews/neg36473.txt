the decorating in the rooms very poor colour paint splashed on to the white paint looks like a person with a roller did it as quick as possible tv signal very poor flashing and loosing pic seats in bar really uncomfortable very modern but with no backs like sitting on a stool when you go for a drink in the bar its nice to lay back in the chair and relax very short on t bags and coffee just enough for one cup of each and the smallest biscuit they could leave these are all small items but they do add up and the cost of the hotel was above average
