extremely disappointed for the room sizes and configuration this seemed to be the style and configuration of the ibis budget hotels i frequently stay in hotels and the novotel on numerous occasions this simply did not have the same look and feel as the rest of the novotel chain i was really disappointed when we had a late lunch in the restaurant my food order was completely wrong and part of it didn t even show up so i asked for it to be cancelled and taken off the bill in the end i think there was a communication issue as the staff did not understand english very well i wouldn t expect the overall level of service from a novotel chain
