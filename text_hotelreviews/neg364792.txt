some of the little details let this place down a bit for us the wine theme is fun but a bit overdone e g all the wine themed toiletries in a hotel like this i d expect shampoo and conditioner not just red wine shower gel that leaves you smelling like booze we struggled to work the heating and the blankets they give you are tiny perhaps this is a common thing in this part of the world but when it s outside you need a proper duvet and more than one medium sized towel per guest in the mornings our room stank of cigarette smoke but the hotel staff never figured out where it was coming from
