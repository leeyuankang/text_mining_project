our only problem was that the air conditioning system had just been turned off prior to our arrival but the weather was still quite warm opening our windows wasn t an option because of several street lights we were moved to a room at the back away from the lights and were able to keep our windows open at night we appreciate the extra effort to solve our problem and found our accommodations very comfortable
