the room deco was not quite our taste the flooring material felt cold and hard a bit worn out furnitures would have liked a proper seating area there was only one armchair althoug there was plenty of room toilet and bathroom very distant to eachother had to walk across the whole room to wash your hands after going to the toilet not very practical or hygienic in a walking distance to the inner city but no public transportation stops very close
