the bathroom arrangements are a bit odd modern and clean but odd the sink is across the other side of the room to the toilet and the shower has a glass door into the room i don t think it would necessarily suit friends who are a bit bashful but as a couple it was fine no coffee making facilities in the room but they will deliver free tea or coffee to the room on request
