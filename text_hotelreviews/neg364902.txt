got in late and our reserved non smoking room smelled like smoke was given a new room which was much smaller for the same price the room had almost no storage space double bed was actually twin beds and the bathroom had no privacy you could see from room right into the shower there were also hardly any outlets went to the bar and there were loud business men who were talking very loudly about work we could not hear each other talk over the men so we took our wine back to our room
