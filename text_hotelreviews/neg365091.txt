very hard to find the parking and you can hear the sound of cars passing by from your room we asked for higher floor but was given a room near the street with a bad view from construction a little bit far from restaurants and the shopping center you have to walk at least minutes and you ll sweat from the heat of the sun the entrance of the hotel is a road so you have to be careful if you have small children the sofa bed was not that comfortable and there should be more pillow
