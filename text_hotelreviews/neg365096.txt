although within walking distance to the duomo the hotels location felt out of the way and there was a lack of restaurants at night in the immediate area there was a major construction site just outside the entrance to the hotel not the hotels fault at the time of our stay we requested a change of rooms due to a very squeaky bed surely other people must have complained about it would consider other hotels if we were to return to milan
