the room service was a bit difficult to order since they don t really speak english but it s a stars hotel and when i got there i spent few hours to solve the reservation problems i booked the room for two night but the staff insisted that i booked it wrong then i showed her the reference but she couldn t find the booking on the computer and finally she found it as it took a while to wait overall the price is nice and they are friendly the location is good so i will recommend it
