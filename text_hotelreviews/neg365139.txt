the air con was not working in the room we were unable to sleep most of the night as our baby could not settle due to heat when we opened the window the noise of the traffic was so loud it woke the baby up the reason for the aircon not working was that in milan during the cooler months they turn this facility off in the hotel the weather was unusually hot during our stay but this was not a good enough excuse the second night was as bad as the first even though maintenance said they had fixed it there are no baby changing facilities in the hotel except for the hotel room
