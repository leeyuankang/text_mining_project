parking options are very bad we paid for two days we changed room in the first room the toilet was not flushing and the water in the sink also did not flush at the second room we had the same problem with the sink it was smelling in the corridors and we found a hair in the bed the rooms are extremely small we would not recommend this hotel no idea why this hotel had rather high ratings the nh in turin is way better then this one
