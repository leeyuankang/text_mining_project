there is clearly an ongoing problem with homeless people sleeping just outside the hotel and when you re window is right over it all you can hear is them yelling i had to call down to reception to tell them to call the police because they were having a fist fight i would recommend that the hotel work with the police and the city council to try and resolve this problem
