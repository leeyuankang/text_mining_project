we had a room with possible connection to next room locked door we had quite noisy smoking neighbours and all thile noise and smoke was coming through the door to our room we are no smokers and it was a surprise for me that it is possible to smoke in this hotel than one day we notised water coming from above floor in our bathroom the stuff changed our room for the other one but in both rooms we saw old water prints on ceiling so it is a general problem of the hotel sanitary equipment has multiple leakage so when you are taking shower half of water goes not on you but on the walls and floor no surprise that thete are leakage prints on the ceiling in every bathroom the surprise is that a hotel of this level can not fight this problem well
