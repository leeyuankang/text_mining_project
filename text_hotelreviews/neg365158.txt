not so kind staff but maybe they were too much under pressure little tricky to reach the hotel by car because you need to enter area c which has controlled traffic so beware that the hotel has no private garage you can park in one that they indicate anyway it will cost you per day but we already knew it thanks to others guests reviews and you need to buy a card in a newspaper shop to allow your car s plate to ride in area c otherwise you ll get a fine but i just discovered that because i asked the staff i ve travelled throughout firenze that works on the same system as well the guy then told me that we needed to do all that if i hadn t have asked him he wouldn t have told me but he knew i was by car see what i m trying to say is that the staff need to care more for the tourists in this kind of thing
