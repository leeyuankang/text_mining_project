the staff not helpful nor welcoming and in general around the city it is one of europes big cities and i expected good customer service but it is lacked in general we had to take our luggage to the taxi stand around the corner as the girl at the concierge wouldn t call a taxi or send someone to help although we would have tipped them the bathrooms were not well maintained as our two rooms had tubs with problems i wouldn t stay there again nor would i recommend it
