we had an unreasonably long wait to check in on our late night arrival only one member of staff was at the desk the duvet cover of my room mate s bed had a nasty stain not discovered until after our first night s sleep we stripped it and put the offending linen in the bath so that it could be replaced it was replaced but the duvet itself was folded on the chair so we had to sort that out ourselves a four star hotel the breakfast room was completely chaotic there was not enough room for everyone to move around while getting their buffet breakfast our friends bathroom was poorly stocked only one of everything for two guests
