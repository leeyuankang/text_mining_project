i did not like that there was no ac i understand the weather was cold outside but i prefer to have ac in the room instead of opening the balcony door since i dont feel safe this way i asked to lower the tempreture of my room but they told me it is not possible although fewer days before my check in in milan i was at nh collection vittoro venetto i asked for the same thing they lowered my room tempreture i think it would be better if each room had the option to switch on off ac
