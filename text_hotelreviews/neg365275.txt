staff needs to be more friendly staff needs to listen to instructions at check in i reserved a superior room with no connecting doors but i got a small room with connecting doors they then corrected the mistake asked for an iron and ironing board made me sign a receipt and then took the iron after a few hours without my consent fyi the iron board is too large to fit into my luggage rooms too warm fyi the ac needs to offer adjustment down to degrees not only the bed needs to be softer
