i did not like the cards to read the doors and the elevator i think it should not be chips but more like sensors on the card because my card was broken in my room from half more or less because i needed to insert it then i could not use the elevator to go to the reception and i found the fire exit in the hotel to move to reception and change it i was in the floor so for a customer i don t really think that it is useful i think it is quite expensive for this hotel the room was quite dark and small yet clean and good the car park is a problem and i don t understand why nh hotels is not making a deal with the car park behind the block to at least reduce the cost of the car parking i paid euros out of nothing for car park for two nights for me for the hotel customers it should be max euro per night
