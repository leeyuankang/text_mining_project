air conditioning was not functioning properly the room was mostly too hot in general in the hotel it was too hot the room was very small for two people for the price charged we selected in booking com a room for with seperate beds and the price is higher than a twin bed but the two beds were nearly fixed to each other some small objects that are standard for the room were missing like laundry bag cotton pads mostly few people working at the reception price performance ratio is mediocre
