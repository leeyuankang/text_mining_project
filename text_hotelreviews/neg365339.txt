i booked this hotel because the wifi explicitly said they had bathtubs and i specifically requested this in my reservation when i got there they gave me a room with two beds and no bathtub without asking i had to ask for a change to a room with king size and bathtub after i moved all my stuff to a new room i realized it did have the bed but not the tub it was too late so i decided not to change it again anyway this was a big disappointment
