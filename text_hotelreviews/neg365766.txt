it s not as close to the center as we expected it to be and the area around it is not that cool but at least the tram station is right in front still it doesn t seem like a star hotel more like stars it s very small and right by a busy street so it s good if you just want a nice and clean little place to stay for a couple days but not if you re looking for something more fancy
