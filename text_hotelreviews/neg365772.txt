the main problem with the place is the microscopic size of the room while one expects generally smaller rooms in europe this one is particularly small for the room rate it is about as small as london hotel rooms may be even smaller there is barely enough room for a twin bed and your suitcase the free wifi in the room is barely adequate pretty poor connection most of the time
