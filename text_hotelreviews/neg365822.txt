the staff were rude we hadn t noticed until we retired to bed that the room turnaround hadn t included the usual towels or water when we called the night concierge they didn t accept we were right so made us look around the room like we hadn t done that for them no response or acknowledgement when they did finally deliver the towel and water later that night made to feel like it was our fault awful decided after a long working day to order room service drinks can be ordered by the provided room service number but when you try to order food they give you a separate number to call the restaurant when you hang up considering this is branded as room service throughout the room why not take my order there and then like all other hotels be aware the walls are paper thin literally good luck if you also have kids running around the hallway at am you can hear everything in the halls and in the rooms next to you
