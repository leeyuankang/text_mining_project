standard single room was very small had to change rooms because toilet in first room wouldn t stop flushing even after someone came to fix it first night let staff know morning of second day on my way out to see sights but nothing had been done by time of my return so i was bumped up in second room there were a number of minor issues knob to door lock fell out bathroom ceiling had large patch of peeling paint had to take quick showers because the drain didn t work shower door and shower window didn t close properly television only displayed static wifi was spotty throughout etc none of these were major issues but at euros for nights i expected much more also no need to have such a central location in the city and to call the staff fluent in english would be a bit of an overstatement you still need to go to a tourist information kiosk for any real guidance
