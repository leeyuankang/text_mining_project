for the money and what you get facility and amenity wise there s much better options there is no bar and although there s a reading room it is unstaffed so you have to ring a bell for attention and no one comes we waited mins and nothing there is no other facilities at the hotel and the staff are pretty unfriendly we may as well have booked an apartment somewhere as we literally had a room to use and that was it we used it as a base so it was great for that due to location but for less money there are better options out there
