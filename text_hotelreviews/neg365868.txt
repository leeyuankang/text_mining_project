the breakfast was average from the food to the staff not kind at all not too many things offered scrambled eggs not tasty no fresh croissants pastries or cheese variety hot drinks should at least be served at the table the housekeeping personnel makes too much noise lack of respect for the guests speaking loudly in the hallways early in morning the fridge in the room was barely cooling anything soap and shampoo were not given on a daily basis we had to call reception to ask for them the hairdryers should definitely be changed very poor choice of tv channels and last but not least everything happening in the rooms around could be heard horrible soundproofing
