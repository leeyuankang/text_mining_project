i asked for a double room with two separate beds yet when we arrived to the room it was one double bed i went to ask a reception and they kindly moved our stuff to another room for when we arrived back when we arrived to the new room it was one double bed and a sofa secondly there were faulty plug sockets next to the mirror which were falling apart and could be considered as a hazard additionally only certain lights in the room were working
