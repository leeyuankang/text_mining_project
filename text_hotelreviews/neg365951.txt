we paid extra for a royal room which was directly over the adjoining restaurant so woken at every morning by staff dragging chairs and tables about also general toilets are on the same floor so constantly disturbed by inconsiderate guests talking and doors closing late at night whoever designed the layout wants shooting not withstanding this we would stay in this hotel again but on a higher floor
