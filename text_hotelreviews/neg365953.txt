the drink ordering service to the lounge area was non existent which was a great pity because the first floor area looks out over las ramblas and would have been ideal to relax in but you couldn t get anyone to turn up and serve you at times queuing in the reception was excessive the overall experience suggested that they were short staffed but nonetheless those on duty always had a smile and were helpful the hotel owners should invest in delivering a better level of staffing so that reality meets with the expectation of guests
