stayed in a superior room view rambla and it is very small all the hotel areas are small including the breakfast area and lounges the one on the first floor is shared with a public italian restaurant and they fill it with tables if necessary relaxing at the lounge drinking a coup of tea with a view rapidly transforms in drinking a tea with a view and noisy people eating next to you definitely a place in a strategic location just for sleep with relative comfort but too expensive for what it offers poor quality price
