the royal rooms were not as advertised and seemed to be small and a little pokey it was claimed there was a sitting space and showed an integrated sofa and minibar however a single chair and a minibar ticked in a cupboard that could not be opened were not up to scratch also the hotel is directly above the train lines and in the morning the hotel did shake with the trains passing underground really make the upper floor the premium rooms and maybe plan out the rooms a little better
