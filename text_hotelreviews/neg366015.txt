wish we had been informed that building work was on going at this hotel hammering and drilling every day until also our room was supposed to be soundproofed we could hear people in the rooms on either side of ours using the bathroom and conversations on the telephone we were offered another room on the first floor opposite the public toilets and with more noise from the metro wish we had chosen another hotel very disappointed
