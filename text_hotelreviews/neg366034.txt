the reception is far from being friendly i think they ignore the fact that they are serving customers they know they have a good location and they don t care if the customers are happy or not there is always someone new who will select the hotel for its location very poor welcome service not even saying welcome or smiling once after calling times that there is no toilet paper in the room instead of apologizing the answer from the receptionist is we usually have toilet paper in the rooms complaining about the blocked sink old towels everyday but not getting an apology during check out no thank you or any means of conversation which makes you leave with good feelings we felt like we were not customers but we owe them and we had to live with long faces and bad service because we haven t paid our debt on time breakfast is expensive no real cofffee but still better than any alternative on la rambla breakfast places all in all not star service not even hostel level but good location
