for a hotel you would expect walls to be a little thicker being situated in a room on a low floor and right near the lift we found the room noisy we also had what i pressume was a maintenance guy open our door walk straight in without knocking obviously making a mistake quickly shut the door but i found this extremely distressing all evening thinking someone else may walk in at any point all in all though royal ramblas is far off a bad hotel there are much better hotels situated close on las ramblas with better facilities and thicker walls for the same price and therefore better value for your money we know because we moved after the first night less money same star but with a roof top pool
