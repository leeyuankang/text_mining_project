not close to the central area although there are trolley s closeby there are really no restaurants around and the one in the hotel is not great the hotel is awaiting a liquor licence so you cannot get a drink although there is a grocery store nearby that sells wine if you want ice they give it to you in a plastic bag that leaks in minutes and if you want cutlery they give you plastic ones
