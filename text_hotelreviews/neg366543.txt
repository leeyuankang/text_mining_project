took ages for the hot water to get to us had to turn the tap for on for at least minutes did mention to staff on our departure who said she will get maintenance onto it there were three lifts but one was out of action so had to wait a while for a lift the steps were very steep and narrow so was hard to use them they were upgrading the rooms with new toilet systems we were lucky to have one but the new unfitted ones were left at the entrance in the foyer that looked a bit unsightly
