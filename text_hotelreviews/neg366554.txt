the lift i understand that lifts break occasionally so no big deal that i was stuck in one at this hotel but when i pressed the alarm there was no feedback no one to say they had heard the alarm and that an engineer would be coming just silence and no emergency phone number posted inside the lift ok they got us out after maybe minutes but of the lifts i ve been stuck in during my life that was probable the worst and no apology from the management that was weak customer relations
