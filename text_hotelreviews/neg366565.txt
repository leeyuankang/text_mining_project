the bed had bed bugs and i have many pictures to prove it after complaining to the hotel they told us they were fully booked and could not move us and that housekeeping had gone home so there was nothing they could do i appreciate there was nothing they could do but i thought they could have called someone to try and make it better for us change the mattress maybe i had to stay in a bed bug ridden bed for another night woke up with more bites and it ruined my stay and made me feel ridiculously dirty
