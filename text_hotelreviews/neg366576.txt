first of all we checked in and there was stains all over our bed sheets after unpacking we decided to get a shower and freshen up before going back out the drains made the smell of the bathroom almost unbearable my partner used the shower where we found the hook for the shower wasn t secure which made the actual shower head fall off and smack him in the face causing him to have a black eye before we went out we passed this on to the staff who may i add was lovely young girl with dark hair she said she would look into getting the shower fixed and bed sheets changed we said we d see if the smell of the room had calmed down before we had to move as we had unpacked and we had little time to start with and loads we wanted to do we didn t arrive back while the next morning and to our surprise the shower head was still in the same position unfixed the bedding was still stained but the smell of the drains had gone so we stayed in the room and decided we would mention it the next morning as it was late and been on the floor it was a bit of an inconvenience having to go all way back down we where really disappointmented that the staff had made promises to them just ignore our requests when we went down stairs the next morning we mentioned it to the staff on reception who was really rude advising basically that she wasn t going to do anything because we didn t mention it last night as soon as we got back try going to the floor at and wanting to come back down we left it with her hoping something would get sorted arrived back that evening still nothing had been done and also no fresh towels and the smell of the drain was back as we where checking out the next morning we left it and decided we would right a complaint instead when we woke up the morning to pack there was a beetle type creature crawling in our bed sheets the same mucky stained ones wed litrally stripped of the bed and slept with only the pillow
