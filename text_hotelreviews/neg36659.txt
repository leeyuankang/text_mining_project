staff were not friendly and completely ignored us when trying to check in the check in process was a shambles they couldn t find our booking and the first member of staff that served us just walked off and left us waiting for over minutes very unprofessional we were also charged pounds deposit for having our dog stay night which is ridiculous surely just a money making scheme
