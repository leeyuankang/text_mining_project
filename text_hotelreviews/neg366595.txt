after a long warm day at work i was looking forward to a nice cool beer i didn t read the small print but it is a no alcohol hotel i just walked down the road and found a nice pub like bar the check in staff was as friendly as influenza check out guy was much better if i hadn t of paid over for nights i may have been a bit more positive i will not be stopping here again and will let everyone where i work as they are looking for a new hotel to house clients
