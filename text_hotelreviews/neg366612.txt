i booked rooms for the nights i assumed the rooms would have heat to warm and a c to cool when we arrived the temp was we had not heat complaints brought the repairman on wednesday unit could not be fixed management had been notified by previous guest repairman said they had replace many due to faults and knew this was broken the temperature changed and it became warm we had no cooling repairman returned and told mgmt it was still broken we had tours on sat and sunday management told us to clean out our rooms and them would move us when we came in at night we came in at from an all day tour and no rooms no change no courtesy all we got was you can go back to your old room there was not a vacant room in the house it went on and got worse i plan to write the hq for this franchise to tell them how we were treated teir offer of consolation was to pay for breakfast and give me one night s credit the exhaust in the bath did not work either as it is connected to the cirfculation in the room we had none anywhere the hotel advertised a bar and dining room that served drinks no it is a dry hotel if you want ice to cool a drink or soda or water you walk to the lobby and get some in a plastic bag no ice buckets no staff to help with bags or anything i believe this facility is working itself away from western guests my daughters room was another story in the middle of the room was a major support pillar about on each side the chairs were placed at an angle to the left and right you could only see half the tv from either side we paid almost for these rooms it makes me wonder about the quality of other rooms booked through your service sincerely mrs doris k laustsen
