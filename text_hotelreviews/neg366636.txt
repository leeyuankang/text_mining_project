terrible restaurant unfortunately when my meal arrived first it was still cold as though it just came out of the freezer it was definitely a frozen pizza i asked for it to be cooked again which they did but forgot an element of the meal so my partner and i ate at separate times and the final element of the meal arrived after we had finished such a pity because with a great restaurant it would be an all rounder
