i know amsterdam has a great public transportation but the hotel is too far off you spend your holidays worried about which tram or bus to take and which stop is the more suitable for you in the day time that s ok but at night time it can be very stressful believe me we got there at night time and as soon as you give your name they charge you the room without hesitating we paid more than our reservation said the restaurant was quite expensive we only went once for breakfast and they had two options euro to eat there or else to take away nothing in between we just wanted a coffee and toast that s all but we had to take away or breakfast and eat it in our room the room doesn t have a full mirror so you have to go to the small one in the bathroom which is stuck between the door and the toilet one of the beds was wobbly the carpeting is way too old it s my fourth time in amsterdam by the way but this time i m disappointed because i paid for a star hotel
