we stayed in an apartment which only had internal access to the main hotel via a staff service corridor not what i expected the living area was nice if a little dark the bathroom was tiny and cold the bedroom stank of cigarette smoke because hotel staff were smoking directly underneath our window all night the window didn t seal properly so disgusted we left after one night
