the staff at the restaurant were very nice but you just hear them talking loud all the time as if they are selling fish at the market also sometimes they didn t bother to clean a pile of plates from a table where people are having their breakfast they preferred to clean a table when a couple left the restaurant first priority always those present just stating this in a good way to improve not to be harsh on the staff i m a supervisor myself so maybe that s why i noticed these things
