the room was dirty and dusty maintenance and decor very poor paint peeling off skirting boards bathroom unclean with mould on the bathroom curtains bath itself cracked shower fixture did not hold shower head properly so stand up showering impossible bedroom curtains falling off the hooks no bath towels at checking and hand towel wet when asked reception for conditioner had none guest expected to go to reception to collect an iron and ironing board honestly this hotel was simply shocking very disappointed as nothing like the photos on the website definitely would not recommend
