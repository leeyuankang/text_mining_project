there was paint bubbling on the bottom of the wall the room was pretty dusty in general the hotel view was right opposite a massive housing estate the net curtains looked like they hadn t been washed in years and the windowsill was disgusting all i heard all night was water pipes dripping and doors just slamming i had the worst nights sleep there and would certainly not recommend this hotel to anybody
