check in was poor with the refurbishment they seem to have done away with a reception desk and staff meet you with an ipad rather like visiting an apple store it doesn t work maybe in theory but not practice leaving guests with bags in a busy area feeling a bit abandoned maybe this is a new way of doing things but in an established five star property it not expected it wasn t quicker and it wasn t welcoming the restaurant was very busy with a great atmosphere and staff were efficient the food wasn t as good as expected however maybe it was just our choices the chips were amazing though
