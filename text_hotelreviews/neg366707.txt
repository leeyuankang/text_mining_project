we had so many problems with our room we first of all had to change rooms because of a leak coming from the next room which soaked our carpet and wall behind the desk the shower in our first room had no seal down the bottom so it absolutely drenched the entire bathroom floor in our next room the hairdryer kept blowing a fuse the key cards wouldn t work and only one socket worked not worth a four star rating
