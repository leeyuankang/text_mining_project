firstly upon our arrival the woman that was at the reception was not very smiley nor very friendly after i wanted to pay a city tax was added to my fee that was not mentioned in my booking confirmation after arguing turns out a very small font says city tax not included was there i thought that was horrible and should be highlighted since not all guests are willing to do math and its not a very convenient way when we received our rooms the safe was not working we called the reception for help it took them hour to come to our room and fix it which delayed our outing the rooms where not very nice and their vintage look was not very successful for it looked poor and cheap the pictures aren t very true to reality during our stay we noticed poor housekeeping since the floor was never vacuumed and dust was everywhere the major disappointment i got from this hotel was that the day we wanted to check out we woke up at and there was no electricity in the whole hotel we were on the floor and had big luggages with us but no elevator i went down to the reception using the stairs which are super steep and dangerous to find a guy on the reception telling me amsterdam has a black out i asked for his help to bring the luggage down the stairs he refused in the begging but then helped us the poor guy went up stories then down stories with big luggage i understand the black out was not he hotel s fault but a hotel as big as best western blue should have a back up generator no all in all i enjoyed my stay in amsterdam but sorry best western blue i do not recommend you
