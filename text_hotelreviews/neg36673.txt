first of all the apartments were basically student living and had nothing to do with luxury everything was outdated and the bathrooms were tiny and weren t cleaned properly a housekeeping member forced her way into my room and told us she needed to clean the room so that she can finish her shift early while i was sleeping the food is something shocking for a hotel to serve me a raw burger patty and think that it was acceptable actually its illegal in the united kingdom all i can say is you re better off staying at the rosewood hotel
