we were not told at the time of booking or at the front desk that the hotel was under renovation i m sure we were the only people on the floor evause every other room was being torn apart the smell of the glue being used to put up the wallpaper was extremely strong everyday luckily we were out all day touring but the workers where working until pm at night i would have asked to be moved to another floor but we saw a huge tour bus arrive and i didn t want to ask i would posted it on the website or have the front desk advise during check in
