on both mornings of our stay we were awoken early by the fire alarm both of which were false alarms although this was not the fault of the staff they offered little explanation and no apology or compensation staff were not very welcoming and their were lots of workmen around the hotel moving furniture and fitting new doors one morning we waited minutes for the lift because all were being used by workmen moving furniture and pots of paint
