location too far away for cheap taxi rides or walk to the city centre not sure whether usual approach attitude but staff was very straightforward and i don t think that i have seen anyone from the staff smile even once perhaps a cultural thing in netherlands so it may be just my ignorance the area where the hotel is located is residential and slightly dogy there are no many nice coffee places around here and the only food place open after late is kfc and kebab place
