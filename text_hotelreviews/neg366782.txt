the booking company that some of my party used went out of business a couple of months prior to our trip so some of the rooms were cancelled the hotel group never had the decency to inform our party so upon arrival we were intormed that there were no rooms for people out of a people group the hotel reception staff were not very helpful we e eventually got it sorted at an inflated price not good for a major hotel chain
