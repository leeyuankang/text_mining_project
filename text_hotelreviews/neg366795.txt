the rooms were poorly furnished awkward to use and with very old furnishings the bathroom was okay and the best bit the beds were uncomfortable and the duvets had a very cheap synthetic filling the kind that makes me very hot indeed and suffocates rather than lets your skin breath through it the tea was awful there were plastic plastic spoons and not enough cupboard space at all the internet in the room for the most part was almost unusable due to speed i had to go to the lobby to access the internet a very uncomfortable stay which would have been fine at per night but at more than wow that is expensive and i ll never stay there again
