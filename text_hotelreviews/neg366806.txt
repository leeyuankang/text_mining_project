the hotel is located in a not very nice neighborhood if you are traveling with family or alone be aware that the surroundings of the hotel are not the best the biggest problem with the hotel is the staff i have never seen such rude and unhelpful people working in the tourism business at the front desk they were completely discourteous with guests that requested any type of information about how to get to the center or an indication of a good restaurant in the area one of them even rolled her eyes at me i was quite shocked the restaurant is also quite an experience on the first day we had payed or breakfast previously and the hostess stopped my husband literally accusing him of being there without having paid this was clearly their mistake and they solved it however they didn t apologize and they were just plain disrespectful at another instant one of the waiters reprehended me because i was making sandwiches for my kids to take with me really on a buffet breakfast he was terribly impolite and it was quite scene also i really didn t understand why he came at me since there were other people leaving the restaurant with plates full of fruit and bread i can only imagine it was because i was traveling with kids and this is not a family friendly hotel what a shame the hotel is ok but it is very ill managed
