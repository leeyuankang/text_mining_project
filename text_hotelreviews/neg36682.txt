took nearly two hours to wait for one of the rooms for our group we checked in at and didn t have the room until we had to cancel a reservation we had elsewhere whilst waiting for this room and were there to celebrate an anniversary so this was extremely frustrating staff were uncoordinated and slightly arrogant to our situation not something i would have expected from one of london s top star hotels
