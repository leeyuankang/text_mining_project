i feel that the rooms could have been better the rooms looked quite old in terms of the decor and is really quite a standard room the location was quite far but there are good tram links around if you are with a big group i don t recommend taking cabs as it is quite expensive they charge more for people we checked in quite late and there was only one person on reception which delayed our checking in as they were dealing with multiple people at once
