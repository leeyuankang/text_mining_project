if you intend to park your car in the parking garage when you check in go to the left of the check in counter and open the door to the garage just to note it s location and appearance otherwise you may never find your way out of the garage the door says emergency only which of course is not true the door from the garage to the hotel is very poorly marked with a sign hanging from the ceiling about ft in front of the door which you ll never see after hours don t go into the automatic door to the shops in the garage which might be closed you will get trapped like we did and couldn t get out this was during our search for the door to the hotel front desk should have been more helpful they didn t tell us about the garage door didn t mention the bus only the tram park on the ground floor of the parking garage and when you enter you have two choices for parking ticket take either one front desk didn t tell us this either room had four beds in it and there were only two of us so it was cramped room safe was locked and on the floor so not usable
