location was difficult to find especially coming in at night we were lucky to have found a local who gave us wonderful directions after min of wandering aimlessly lost hair dryer did not work only lasted min before cutting off no wash cloths and the towels were great if you enjoy drying off with tiny over starched towels we also found that elevators were overlooked a few times we found spilt alcohol drinks in puddles on the floor inside and out of the elevators
