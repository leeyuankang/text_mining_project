not worthy of stars at all had dirty blood stained mattress in first room so was moved to another room where it didn t have a window that could open wifi cuts off and you have to sign back in every poor television signal and only english channels and no english subtitles our duvet was dirty and we told there were no more doubles so we were given two single duvets very outdated furniture would not recommend this hotel nor would i stay in it again we were expected to use water from the bathroom for tea and coffee would advise everyone staying here to check duvet covers and mattresses not a pleasant stay for us
