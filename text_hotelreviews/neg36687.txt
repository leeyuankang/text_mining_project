first morning of breakfast a smartly dressed lady with shoulder length hair showed us to our table and just left us there we didnt know if we helped ourselves to things like juices or even if they were included in our rate etc i had to get up and go find someone to ask no vegan or vegetarian breakfast options even though we paid for full breakfasts i was offered a hash brown to be made which i accepted then upon checking out the hotel attempted to charge us extra for it thankfully michael who checked us out spotted the mistake and removed the charges our room was very small and needed a freshen up old yellowing grout in bathroom along with old tatty bath mat picture placed on top of the dressing table mirror very inconvenient we couldn t really find anything superior about the room iron was dirty and marked my cream top which i m hoping will wash out requested a mocha which is a very common coffee and was twice brought a black coffee was also confused by the breakfasts being brought out on a tray or left at the juice table by one waiter then served by another
