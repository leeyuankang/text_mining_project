do not get a taxi to the hotel from the airport we got caught out by a really nice taxi man who then charged us for a minute drive to the hotel that s so easily accessible by bus or tram this hotel is definitely a weird one we stayed in february for nights i booked on booking com and it wasn t the cheapest but i assumed it was good because of its stars it definitely doesn t deserve those stars i ve stayed at cleaner hostels the restaurant wasn t open on sunday or monday which was really odd the opening hours for the restaurant were also odd like there s a few restaurants around but if you wanna eat well or you re a vegetarian do not stay here myself and my boyfriend who would eat anything went to bed hungry every night we were given room when we arrived and it was a dingy smelly little room with hairs in the bed and mould on the wall behind the curtains the whole room smelled like urine or something and there was stains on the walls even the surfaces were dirty and dusty there wasnt even a window i could open the kettle smelled like vinegar had been boiled in it and even tho requested there was no bath that really annoyed me as we live in an apartment and i was really looking forward to having one i complained at reception about the bath and the girl said she could move us the following day the mattress was comfy but the pillows gave me a headache no batteries in the remote no milk and there was teabag rang down for some and an hour later had to ring again because they forgot i would stay again if i was desperate as i know amsterdam is expensive but i d have to be pretty desperate
