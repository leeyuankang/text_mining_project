we had problem with the wifi connection in our room we were in a group staying in different types of room so i thought maybe the others might also have problem with the connection but it turned out that it s just us so i called the reception they answered after i called times and a receptionist named peter just answered he cannot do anything about it what a customer service i even asked him if he can kindly try to restart the modem router just to solve the problem which fortunately worked out thanks to me one more thing i asked for a coffee in the morning on the day of out check out at the reception but nobody bothered to bring me one luckily the cleaning staff were so kind to help me out the facilities aren t that great but if the staff were trained well then the experience staying here would have been great
