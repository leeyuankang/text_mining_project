the hotel has seen the better days the interiors are getting shabby and worn out you can t open the windows but the air con is pretty old fashioned they tuck the blanket into the bed so it is very short up to middle of your chest then and i was bitten by bedbugs there are tourist groups staying at the hotel so be warned the location area is not welcoming
