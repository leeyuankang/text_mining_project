the hotel has lost its alcohol licence so there is no bar we had to go to the local shop to buy a bottle of wine and then sit in our room our quadruple room could have done with a good clean as it was very dusty and there were many marks on the carpet also the air conditioning didn t work the restaurant had a limited menu and ran out of vegetarian options
