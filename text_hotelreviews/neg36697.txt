housekeeping did a very bad job the bed skirt needed lots of therapy carpets were not clean beds were never turned there was no that feeling of cleanliness each time housekeeping came one housekeeper came to lecture us that we were staying too long in our room and that she needed to go and do her job on a different floor at the bar upstairs we were served instant coffee and a cup was dirty had to return one of the three members of staff at the bar had torn pants and the tear was near his butt that was not a new tear the pant has simply not been upgraded it was a bit embarassing for this calibre of hotel the gym was neglected hated that i didn t get to soak in the spa
