i was not informed that the entire hotel is under renovation at time of booking if i had known i certainly would have booked elsewhere for the price the staff were not sympathetic to the situation however did say they were lodging a complaint with booking com because it was not clear at all that this was renovation taking place the entire front entrance was blocked by construction walls no lobby no tea room something we had planned to enjoy no spa available despite the advertisement that one existed way too much money for a star hotel in this condition we could have stayed in a star hotel and had a better experience will not book this hotel again may not use booking com either as this was misrepresentation
