being asked times where i had travelled from the manner in which i was initially dealt with at reception i understand very well there are procedures policies and systems in place which staff must adhere to but extra care needs to be taken when speaking to guests as i did feel as if i were being suspected of not being genuine very quickly luckily the manager handled the situation we got into very well and quickly with little fuss i won t judge the entire experience based upon misunderstandings as this is an excellent hotel and i chose it due to having stayed once before in one of the suites
