the room had unattractive decor and was lacking in comfort eg only one chair to sit on bad lighting although deluxe the hotel was surrounded by noisy and dusty roadworks i think booking com especially as you are in amsterdam should have made potential bookers aware of that the outside cafe etc were unusable and the noise started early in the morning and hindered access it was disappointing
