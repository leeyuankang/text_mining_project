there were only two very minor things i did not like but i wouldn t hold them against the hotel per se i only add there here as some others may dislike them the first was the duvet for the bed our bed was massive and extremely conformable but the duvet was split into two parts it was as if they were intended for twin beds which is what it ended up feeling like the second is regarding the shower gel the hotel provides a dispenser on the wall in the shower rather than as a separate single use bottle i have only ever seen this been done in the ibis hotels so it came across as cheap and not what i would have expected from a star hotel i do however see the argument that this method of dispensing the shower gel is more environmental which is why i would not complain about it i just know for some this might be a bigger issue
