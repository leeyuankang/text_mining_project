staff took for the room on booking in stating it would be returned in cash in booking out making the mistake of relying on this cash when we booked out amazingly it couldn t be returned due to staff error and i would have to wait up to weeks for my card to be reembursed not acceptable at all especially due to the matter of fact manner of the staff also a city tax taken off me which had never been mentioned anytime by anyone soured the experience totally for me
