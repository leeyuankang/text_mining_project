initially they gave us a horrible almost windowless interior room i had to change it immediately it s quite an expensive hotel for what you get and i chose it largely because it was attractive so to be offered a very ugly room was really depressing i couldn t have spent night in there let alone that said the minute i protested i was given another room but i would have preferred not to have started my holiday like that not very soundproof i was woken by my neighbour s telephone alarm location is convenient for museums and boats but it s a big noisy square full of tourists drinkers and right now roadworks next time i would stay in the museum quarter itself or in jordaan
