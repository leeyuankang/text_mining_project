this hotel has several rooms that look like they might have been storage rooms many years ago but which are now fitted as guest rooms and that s where we were put our room was painted black with a red accent wall and another white wall with black flooring black draperies and bed linens and was so dark that you couldn t easily find things if you dropped something on the floor there were several shelves just inside the door also painted black and adding to the dreary atmosphere but they were great for our things the lighting was not very good exacerbated by too much black and windows that were so not tall but very high up on the wall so you really couldn t see out what light they let in was impeded by the black draperies and heavy sheers on the windows there was an overhead light and each side of the bed had a gooseneck led but it was not really sufficient for reading the room has a bar fridge full of all sorts of things but it s hooked up to a sensor so if you move anything in the fridge you will be automatically charged there was a small square section that would could put a couple of cans of something but it wasn t tall enough to put a bottle of water since dark little room we were in was fairly expensive this kind of fridge strikes me as being nothing more than a cash grab the unit is of little practical use the tv was okay but only for the person on that side of the bed because it was small and didn t really extend far enough that the other person could see it we weren t there to watch tv but if it s in the room i d like it to be usable there was a lot of construction in the front of the hotel but no signage to tell you where to go to get into it the construction isn t the hotel s fault the lack of signage is
