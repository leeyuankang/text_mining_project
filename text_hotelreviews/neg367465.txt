two tiny things marred our stay this time we were given a room with a balcony that was blocked off on all sides basically like an open shed we walked in and out of that claustrophobic room and they offered to change it to a great one albeit the next day as the hotel was pretty booked this one is a recurring issue with the americain the shower flow is abysmal given that its an old heritage property one does make some concessions to modern plumbing but wiping yourself down with fluffy white towels after a narrow drip shower flow does ruin the luxurious feel of an otherwise great stay
