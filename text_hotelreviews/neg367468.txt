we got an really awful room when we arrived at the hotel it felt like it was in the cellar the room was below ground level the windows was facing a very small and dark courtyard which made the room very dark and it was also very cold in the room when we wanted to change room we were asked to pay euro extra per night for the upgrade even though the description of the room on booking com said that all rooms of this type should have views of the canal or the square
