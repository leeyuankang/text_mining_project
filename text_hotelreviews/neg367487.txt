upon arrival we were told that our room was going to be beside road works but we would be offered a free meal as a token we opted to go for the course dinner and this was also offered to our friends who were staying in another room the road works did not cause us too much disturbance and we were grateful for the meal but we felt we should have been informed of this before our arrival although the food was delicious while we were eating we noticed a mouse in the dining area this wasn t an issue for three of us but one girl did need to leave the table and could not finish her meal
