it is a tired hotel which was expensive compared to others we have stayed in very dark quite depressing interiors with terrible bedroom lighting and not many pictures etc to make a very large room comfortable my daughters bedroom was so small she could barely put her suitcase anywhere we didnt feel that we wanted to hang around there so spent as little time as possible which is a shame because it was expensive
