only a minor negative we didn t have a mirror in the bedroom only the bathroom the hairdryer was fixed in the bathroom but it was tricky if you wanted to use straighteners with no mirror there is some work going on outside improvement to the walkways and roads it wasn t too much of a problem we weren t affected by any noise but some pathways were temporarily closed it will look lovely when completed
