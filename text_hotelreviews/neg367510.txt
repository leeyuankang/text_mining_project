we had a noisy guest in the next room making loud phone calls in the early hours of the morning the first night which led to a terrible night s sleep while it s not the hotel s fault if they have inconsiderate guests we did feel the walls between rooms were very thin in the room it was separated from he next room by a locked door and it sounded like the neighbour was pretty almost in the same room and we could hear every word spoken staff were helpful when we asked to move to another room however and subsequent nights sleep were fine
