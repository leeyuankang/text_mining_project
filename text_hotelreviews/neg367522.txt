housekeeping was not good the restaurant for evening could do better at making single travelers feel less singled out i don t want to be seated in the middle of the room or to the side when there is clearly an empty table by the window they did clean off the table but then i was not provided a wine list as the tables with couples were etc etc clearly they didn t feel i should have the same service as a couple does too bad because i think more and more people will travel alone
