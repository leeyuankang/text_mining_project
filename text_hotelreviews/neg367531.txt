the bed wasn t that comfy booked a double room with double bed and we got single beds very irritating a lot of noise come through the windows but didn t really bother us that much because we had been drinking most nights bed cover was stained rooms were a little dark i think you pay for the location more than the actual hotel room itself as it s slightly overpriced
