cleanliness and overall condition of the accommodation especially conspicuous in the bathroom where there were plenty of spots with dust and smudges housekeeping staff seem to be focused more on speed than thoroughness in addition the creaky uneven floors and scuffed walls could use modernizing refurbishing we could hear the creaking on our ceiling from the guests above us if the rooms and corridors were updated and brightened this would be a superb hotel the building itself along with the lobby restaurant bar is simply beautiful
