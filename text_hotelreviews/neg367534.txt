they were going to take more deposit than was advertised they told us our room would be ready in an hour and then told us to come back hours later after we were waiting staff were not very helpful and our room had a small terrace which was attached to a fire escape there was a man possibly security guy that kept coming out and looking into our bedroom it was quite offensive intrusive creepy and scary which made me not even sleep properly
