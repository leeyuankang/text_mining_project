the room was ok but didn t meet the expectations of the pictures shown on booking com some of the staff at breakfast wasn t friendly we waited a long time to order some coffee and when i called a waiter to make our order he didn t even say anything i wasn t even sure if he heard us the coffee arrived a few minutes later though breakfast was supposed to be until but at most of the bakery wasn t available anymore and at they started taking the food away already the following days we decided not to have breakfast at the hotel anymore
