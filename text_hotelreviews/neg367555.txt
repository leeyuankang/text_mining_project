the noise of other people walking around was unbelievable we heard every step above us and next door due to the creaking floorboards seriously difficult getting to sleep they should really look into noise control as guests will be suffering on each floor as people can t help moving around they also charge euros for a small bottle of water annoying as we had to keep going out to get bottled water to avoid paying crazy prices for the price i would have expected small sachets of milk in the room not powdered creamer and toilet roll that wasn t like sand paper staff were lovely and hotel comfortable perfect location they just need to look at there floorboards
