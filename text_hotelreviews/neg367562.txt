our room was big and nice but could not be heated properly there are radiators but they are hidden behind the curtains and the air conditioning unit does not help i wonder if it is not making it worse bath tub and glazed swing shower separation are very bad choices one cannot stand at the shower end of the tub since it significant narrows down and there is not enough space to put two feet proper we wanted to have a quick dinner at the restaurant and cannot think of any slower service in a huge room with just a few customers steak on a bed of mixed cold vegetables is a patently bad idea i had the best looking but coldest steak ever i assume my steak was ready early on and waited for the risotto of my partner i believe i had high expectations including a period defining elaborate decor but i was in a plain er space than anticipated the restaurant showed some sign of the design of the building but the rest was only on the exterior
