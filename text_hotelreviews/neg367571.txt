big gripe at this visit was the check out process it took over minutes waiting i travel to this hotel a lot so this is not a one off the computer admin system came out of the ark so despite the best efforts of the very friendly reception staff to pacify a long line of grumpy travellers you are still going to have to wait a long time allegedly some of the rooms have been refurbished but i have never been given one and the old rooms tired and are very dark poorly lit
