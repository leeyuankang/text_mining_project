the receptionist who were checking us in told us there is no booking under our name and he didn t bother to check the booking com id number as even if the name spelling or any other thing usually its identified by the booking id as any other hotel he mentioned your booking has been canceled though we booked months back and just received a welcoming email from booking com for the hotel confirmation and our visit to amsterdam the process took us more than minutes just as he kept trying with different names to search his records though we asked to search with the id anyway the stay was great though everything else and all other staff were very friendly helpful and quick
