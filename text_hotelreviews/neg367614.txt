the toilets are lacking toilet brush they blame it on the hygiene but i find it odd not to be able to clean toilet after using it they need to reconsider this decision and bring them back since it is quite uncomfortable to leave the toilet dirty after using it when sharing a room with another person this was by far the most expensive and least attractive hotel throughout the whole trip in netherlands we had for about nights i cannot say it was poor fair nor just good it was between good and very good but not up to a standard of other hotels with same category we have visited there of course the management can always use the benefit of having a hotel centrally located in such a strong destination as amsterdam is
