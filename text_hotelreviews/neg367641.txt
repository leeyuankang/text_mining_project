the road works they started in the daytime and went on until around so all through the night they are going on in the square right outside the hotel and are incredibly loud really annoyed we had paid for two nights as would have changed hotels the staff did move us to a quieter room for the second night but if you happen to be in one of the rooms with a window facing out then you will not sleep and for the money we paid around a night it was a real let down
