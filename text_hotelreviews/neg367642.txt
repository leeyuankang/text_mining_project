please be aware that there is major road construction going on right outside the hotel no one warned me about this when i booked the room and it is a major nuisance one night they worked all the way through the night that s right loud road construction going in at in the morning if you are looking for sleep i wouldn t take the chance with this hotel especially for what you are paying to stay here until the construction is finished
