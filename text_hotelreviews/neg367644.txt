there are quite extensive road works going on around the hotel this is not the hotels fault but it is noisy we were told they started work at and finished at not a problem for us as we would be out however someone forgot to tell the workmen as they started at a couple of times check with the hotel when they are planned to be completed we were offered internal rooms but both were a bit too dark so the noise was the better option if you do choose a quiet internal room then ask for one of the recently refurbished ones they look much better
