i do dislike the entrance a lot horrible what the redocoration did with the big hall white tiles all over also the rooms have had an update but not the right one they had done a better job when they restored the old furniture and just got new bathrooms and new carpets its is a shame to distroy the old rare interior with chaep ikea like wooden shelfs and wardropes
