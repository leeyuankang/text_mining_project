through hotels com i requested a late check out and they said this was communicated to the hotel they did not indicate there was any additional charge for this however on check in the reception had no record of this and said it would cost i think euros an hour for late checkout this is poor communication i complained to your management and was granted a late check out with no charge as a client who has used your hotel for very many years i do appreciate this breakfast is rather expensive
