only major complaint was that our room was listed as non smoking but had noticeable stale smoke odor they had no other rooms available that were similar very disappointing we were there two nights and were paying for two additional rooms for family for two nights each gave us two free breakfasts as compensation thought the two breakfasts were minimal compensation for the money we spent at their hotel
