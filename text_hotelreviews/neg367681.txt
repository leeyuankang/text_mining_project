view from the room was disappointing actually there was no view to speak of our balcony was closely packed with the buildings next door gym was rather small if you rent a bike overnight there s no provision for parking outside the hotel which is an inconvenience plus you might discover that the police confiscated your bikes if you park them in the wrong spot it happened to us luckily we had bought insurance
