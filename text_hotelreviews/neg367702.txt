first we had one of the older rooms very loud very dark the ones that are not in the pictures at the beginning after asking for another room twice at first the concierge said that every room in the house is loud the new room was nicer but not very clean the hotel has got very thin walls so you can hear nearly every noise especially the cleaning women starting their work before eight every day we were really diasappointed i thought that with this high price the hotel would offer much more comfort
