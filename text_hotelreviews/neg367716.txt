the poorest conversion of an historic building i have ever seen we stayed in rooms the first they insisted was a canal view but you had to peer over the wall to see the water floor irregular shaped room with white cheap mdf unit for tea and coffee etc cheap nescaf nasty cheap toiletries from a wall dispenser we were offered a which looked like a sleezy nightclub black carpets and walls with a high picture of prince i think i know what they were trying to achieve themed trendy but it was the most uncool aesthetic my teenage daughters laughed their heads off other british tourists agreed you could be staying anywhere no sense of history i ve stayed in better premier inn rooms very poor breakfast beware extra charges inc tax that aren t included in the booking com rate an extra was deducted from my bank weeks before my stay despite the hotel saying the additional charges for a canal view would be payable directly to the hotel i really don t understand all the other positive reviews maybe the other rooms are better either way the hotel needs to be more explicit about what you are paying for
