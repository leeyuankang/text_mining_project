when checking in i was told i had to pay a deposit even though on my booking confirmation it said i complained about this the next morning after checking my confirmation and got it back but with no access to the minibar and couldn t add anything to my room even though they had my card details also the bathroom floor was dirty the dirt could be wiped off of it needed a good mop awful view another building right next to the window no light goes into the room so quite dull and the lights themselves weren t bright would definitely upgrade breakfast way too expensive did not stay for it at all the pancake house nearby is a much better bet and cheaper
