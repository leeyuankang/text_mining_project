when we asked for two single beds we were given a double bed with two single mattresses not what we wanted i had to really insist and they managed to find a room with two separated barely single beds these beds were soooooooo narrow that i rolled out twice seriously i should also add that we are a single couple one with his arm in a cast and they gave us a room as far from the elevators as possible we did not sleep well for nights
