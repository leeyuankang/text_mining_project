we were in a renovated room facing the plaza floor which was very small not what we thought we were getting the new closet they built cut up the room and reduced the potential room space one wall painted black made it feel very dark should rethink some of the elements in the renovation would recommend a lower floor or a river view should have asked to see the room offered which i would highly recommend
