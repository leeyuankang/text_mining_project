very old equipment in the gym there was so weights and no air con we were told to lower our voices by room service lady she said she could hear us in the corridor we weren t even talking that loud not my fault walls are paper thin room was really really dark with just one small window no lights on the ceiling just lamps deco was outdated cleaners didn t clean the room properly left a tray that was brought by room service the night before didn t change our wine glasses overall disappointing experience
