had to pay a night to upgrade to a canal view room didn t have much of a choice as the original room which i was given had a really sucky view of the other building and was really dim although the hotel had a pillow menu all the pillows i picked seemed extremely uncomfortable room was recently refurbished with new mattress and fittings but the mattress had no support at all it was too soft with just a thin mattress topper i did not have a good rest at all for the nights
