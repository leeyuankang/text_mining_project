hospitality tray had no milk rang for some milk and they said come get it from kitchen myself or pay euro and they will deliver it at every other hotel milk has always been free and if brought to room always my choice to give a tip or not which i do so disappointed cleaners left glass on floor dirty then they picked up rubbish but put it on bed instead of a bin and taken away charged for items from mini bar that i hadn t touched so who took them staff tried to enter room thinking we were out at in morning odd stayed in hotels of same rating and higher than this but this was poor would never stay there again and wouldn t recommend it
