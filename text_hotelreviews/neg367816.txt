i think the rate is a bit too high the balcony was an extra charge of euro and plus the hotel added city tax of euros which is a lot had i known this will be added i wouldn t have booked as it turned out to be very expansive after all also breakfast was not included which is a shame the walls are very thin we could hear everything and it was a bit noisy but not too much
