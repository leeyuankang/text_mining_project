we first got a room in an area that was being renovated which meant morning drilling in the room right next to us we were then moved to a room that was extremely cold because the window didn t shut properly we received a radiator to make up for it however the bathrooms had no heating and were extremely cold i found some random socks in the room that didn t belong to me nor my partner i also saw one bug in the bathtub and another one next to the window the furniture is old and outdated overall this was a very bad experience and wouldn t recommend it to anyone
