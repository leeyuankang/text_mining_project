few staffs were very friendly but some are super impolite i have strong opinion about the broken promise offered by the hotel the requirement of two single beds was mentioned clearly on couple weeks ago it is seemed invisible on the other hand the staffs deal with this without any apologies shameful letting the customers to live in the harmful smell room newly renovated what do you want really ridiculous the worst services i have ever seen in europe
