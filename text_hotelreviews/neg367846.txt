few staffs were very friendly but some are super impolite i have strong opinion about the broken promise offered by the hotel the requirement of two single beds was mentioned clearly on couple weeks ago before the checking in time but seemed invisible to the hotel on the other hand without any apologises was totally reasonable after making this mistake letting the customers to live in the harmful smell room newly renovated what do you want really ridiculous the most suck services i have ever seen in europe
