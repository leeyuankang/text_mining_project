our room was cold on arrival and took quite a long time to warm up it is due for renovation so maybe that will be dealt with the bathroom is very small but the building is over years old so any reconstruction is difficult i would prefer a walk in shower to a shower over the bath as this would free up space in the bathroom but that s not everyone s preference the decor of the rooms unfortunately does not match the art deco style of the building and restaurant
