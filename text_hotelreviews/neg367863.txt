we gave stayed at the hampshire before and had a lovely stay we have always booked the suite but on this occasion we had a terrible time with the people in the next room on the first night we had to call the night porter times between and due to the noise coming from the room next door continually banging doors and partying with another couple then the party progressed to the couples arguing and fighting the night porters tried to quieten them down without success i just felt that the management could have done a bit more on the next night to help us
