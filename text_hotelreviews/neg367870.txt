went into the informal bar for a drink which we had also done the previous evening we met an absolute gem of a lady called sarah who was working there a bright bubbly character with a warm infectious personality however on the tuesday evening we sat down and my wife moved some dirty glasses over to another table immediately we heard a loud shout from the bar an older male barman shouted leave them leave them the whole bar went quiet very embarrassing when only trying to help i did ask for a polite word with him in the reception where he continued to shout at me in front of the reception staff then flew back into the bar very unpleasant definitely wasted our evening we are fair people and realise we can all have a bad day but there was no apology
