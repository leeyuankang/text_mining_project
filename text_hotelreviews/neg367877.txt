the feeling is that the management is desperately trying to save money and you feel it during your stay the furniture is run down the toilet paper is of the type you find in public bathrooms in train stations there are no complimentary water bottles just a minibar where bottle of regular water costs euros and these are just some small but irritating examples you get the feeling that they are trying to attract visitors with a low price but than overcharge you on small items and services to make up for it this is ok if the price is attractive enough but don t expect a real star hotel
