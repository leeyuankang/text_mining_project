the only part i did not like about the hotel is the tendency of the staff at reception changing price re the city tax the rate is not the same as the cost listed on their website and each new member of staff gives you a different price i find this unethical also had a problem with my bill at check in my bill was fully paid and on check out it was not naturally i was not happy but it was eventually resolved and they blamed booking com for this my suggestion is email the hotel before check in and hold the hotel to this price
