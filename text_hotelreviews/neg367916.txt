this hotel is basically ok but a bit tired and star corporate rooms are rather underwhelming and stuck in a s s time warp from point of view of a not very good tv fiddly tea coffee facilities creaking floors and beds decor etc automatic minibars shower over bath with those weird double curtains room a bit dark long corridors smelling mildly of disinfectant with unappealing carpets whole place needs a bit more zing to continue to hold market share moving forward
