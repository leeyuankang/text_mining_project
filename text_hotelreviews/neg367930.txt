this hotel seems to trade on a glorious past the room i was first allocated on floor was like an attic room with no view i was moved to larger floor room but again no view the decor of the rooms and corridors whilst clean were very very dated and well below the standard of a hotel the american bar was a huge disappointment also do not expect a welcoming lobby with nice seating areas perhaps like the photographs of many years ago they like to show breakfast was fairly good but there seemed to be very little system in place so you either waited ages for staff or came in quick succession
