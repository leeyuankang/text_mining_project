free internet was a hit and miss affair we got charged euro for some milk to be sent to our room for a cup of tea it was a room service charge the milk charge for a glass was euro so my total charge for a simple glass of milk was euros the hotel is old and very very noisy if you like to have the windows open and enjoy fresh air then don t stay here not only is there construction noise the weekend noise is horrific and we stayed on the canal side finally the tv was also limited with sound problems
