i selected this hotel as a late booking considering that normally this room would have cost over i was disappointed i have stayed in higher quality rooms for a fraction of the price there weren t even any biscuits let alone complimentary water in the fridge the cleanliness was of a high standard but the room was small and average i felt that despite the late booking discount i was paying for location rather than accommodation
