our friends were given the double room and the twin room where me and my wife stayed with year old child was small and crammed shower was broken and we had to give our child a cleanup by filling glasses of water from the sink were then told that they may not be able to fix the shower but then some manager and handyman did fix it but told us to not to adjust the hot cold settings our child had bumped his head on the side of the bed twice due to the room size and furniture and baby cot was taking us most of the space we spoke to the reception but were told that they will not be able to do anything for us baby cot and beds were so close that our child was able to get on the bed but at times lost control and fell on to the floor but the staff didnt seem to care much one of us had to spend the night awake to ensure that our kid doesn t hurt himself badly poor poor experience
