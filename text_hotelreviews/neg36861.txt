the double room is way too small for the price that you pay for people they need to seriously buy new mattresses and carpets our mattress felt like it was years old too soft and they need to put in block out in their curtains the staff in the breakfast room were inconsistent with service some days friendly other days indifferent almost like ignoring you some people just got seated and then were offered coffee tea immediately and most days we sat for a while before we got offered coffee tea or we had to get someone s attention and ask for it on our day we heard that one of the guests next to us was offered hot chocolate cappuccino etc but we were never informed that we had a choice the plates weren t always clean
