the room was very basic and a high price for a location a good miles from the beach staff were helpful when asked but there seemed to only be about staff that worked there value for money wasn t there and it certainly is not a four star hotel if they had said they were stars and knackered off of the bill then that would of made sense i would return to barcelona as the beach and port is fantastic but not with this hotel we found we had to rely on walking or the metro to go anywhere
