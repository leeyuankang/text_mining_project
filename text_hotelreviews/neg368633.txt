the bad for the price there is no breakfast included breakfast is pp in fairness you are told this when booking in my opinion it should be included my advice to people staying here pop out to one of the many local food places for a much cheaper breakfast the ugly staff are rude inconsiderate and perhaps even incompetent allow me to give you just a couple of examples of why i say this if i gave you all the examples during our stay this would be a thesis think expensive fawlty towers we arrived at the hotel to be grunted at by the reception staff initially i thought we could win him over with a smile but no everything he had to do to check us in came with an exasperated sigh everything he picked up he made sure to slam back down on the counter we were made feel very uncomfortable no greeting or basic manners reception will not answer when you ring them from your room many things went wrong with our room every time we tried to ring reception they never answered on the time having to trek to reception i asked why the phone was not answered the reply was a shrug perhaps it was broken i asked if it was going to be fixed again another shrug i asked when it would be fixed got no answer this was very frustrating the circuit board tripped in our room we had no power that was not our issue as sh t happens our issue was with how the hotel dealt with this we arrived back to our hotel with to get our mobiles charged get back out to meet friends for dinner no electricity i walked down to reception phone calls are not answered to tell them this they offered us an adapter i explained that that will not work as there is no power receptionist came up to the room to plug in the adapter walk away we called him back he just looked at the plugs shrugged yes it seems to be the communication method here
