the room had back inside machinery view so kind of missed being able to open windows and enjoy the view reception explained they were remodelling the front rooms so not their fault although rooms are of convenient size for a double it gets a bit too cramped when the sofa bed is open to turned into triple room nothing major but would have been nice to have a bit more space
