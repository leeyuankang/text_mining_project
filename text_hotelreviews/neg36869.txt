we got a room and had to ask for a bigger room in order to get the standard we are used to in hotels in the small room the air condition did not work and it was not possible to open the window the bed was altogether a horror for claustrophobic persons the bigger room was excellent had a bigger bathroom and a normal size doublebed the air condition worked properly and the bigger window could be opened at least a bit conclusion the room size should always be indicated on the booking com website as an orientation and as a reference the photos show the bigger rooms the small rooms are not acceptable in a hotel
