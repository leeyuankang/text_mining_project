ok food options in the hotel but not the best the breakfast was outrageously expensive for one day day if you book in advance for the whole stay vienna has nice coffee houses that offer cheaper options for local stuff i was served re warmed pasta at the restaurant which i didn t appreciate there are better restaurants in the area to opt for walls are thin so you get to hear the performance of your neighbors thus don t stay there with your parents
