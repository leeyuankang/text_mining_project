no extractor fan in the bathroom or if there was it wasn t working the aircon is loud and sometimes didn t seem to work the staff serving coffee for breakfast seemed a bit grumpy and got annoyed if you asked for coffee they said they would come and ask at the table but they never seemed to there was filter coffee freely available though also there is a sign telling you to wait to be seated for breakfast but usually there was no staff member there so some people just pushed past and went in it would have been nice to have tea making facilities in the room as there is in the berlin hotel
