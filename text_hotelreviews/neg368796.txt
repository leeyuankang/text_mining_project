we got a room not showed in the pictures it was in a building next to the main one so from the main elevator we had to walk really a lot to reach the room it was an underoof room small a bit claustrophobic at first sight adding the fact that there is no closet the space is even less when you have your luggage on the floor reception service a bit too much hasty they seem to be always in a hurry concerning other services we tried every day to take the bikes but they were always already taken or broken we tried every day to put the car in their parking place but it has been busy all the days no amenities in the room no water boiler to have a tea or coffe in the room
