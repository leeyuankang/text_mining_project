some of the staff at the reception and especially at the restaurant were passive aggressive it is not what you want to experience at a hotel we found the rules around payment for breakfast quite irrational during check in we had to commit to having breakfast everyday for a set fee otherwise we would have to pay euros extra per person per day for walk ins having no idea how breakfast is like at check in it is absolutely an annoying choice a guest is asked to make we ended up paying more for the same breakfast not what you want to experience at a hotel we stayed at the hotel twice our first room was quite small and it was difficult to move inside the room with multiple bags we were told it was one of the largest rooms and were then given a much larger room for our second stay
