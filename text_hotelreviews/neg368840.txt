bed was too high pillows were way too soft the funny thing of this hotel is that the slightly more expensive city view rooms are too close to the hotel and bar entrance therefore it gets extremely noisy i like to sleep with a window slightly ajar and there was way too much noise from drunk patrons right until about on saturday on sunday the cleaning stuff missed cleaning our room despite the fact that we were out from to we came back for a quick nap and shower and that s when they wanted to clean it s a pity because otherwise this hotel is quite amazing they should work a little more on these aspects
