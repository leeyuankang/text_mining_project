staff is terrible the team is extremely young and obviously badly trained at breakfast or on the rooftop terrace it is almost impossible to get them to serve you drinks at breakfast one member of staff spilled something on the floor wiped it with a wet cloth and did not bother to dry the area minutes later an elderly man slipped on the area and could have been badly hurt the staff then proceeded to wet wipe the floor again and only dried it after i pointed it out quite a few members of staff had such a limited knowledge of german that i could not understand what they were saying i am a native i understand that the hotels target audience is young but even at years old i do like to be welcomed warmly as a paying guest
