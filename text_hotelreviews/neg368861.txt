our room was tiny no storage apart from wall hooks a notice on the wall invited us to store our clothes in a suitcase under the bed since there was very little floor space accessing our clothes was difficult no space for a chair in the room either which might have been okay if there had been any public spaces in the hotel for guests to relax read etc the bar on the top floor catered for a young non resident clientele and was too packed and noisy in the evenings for comfort when i took my book up there during the day to enjoy the impressive view across the city the staff were preparing for a function and i was asked to leave we had the impression the management of this hotel wanted the best of both worlds big bucks from non resident clientele at the expense of relaxation and comfort for those who d paid to stay there we won t be going back
