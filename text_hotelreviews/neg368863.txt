as regular travellers we are used to nice business hotels and it s comodities in our trip in vienna we missed a couple of things that i hope the hotel can improve on the room has no kettle for tea or coffee the pillows were only and too soft we had very nice toiletries but no hair conditioner and the ac was too strong which led to us opening the window more than we would like as it was chilly outside and since we were facing the street a bit more noisy
