awful restaurant hadn t eaten here before as always full so this time we booked online when we arrived no booking but only half full starters were just about ok but main courses revolting decided not to have beef after being told that if i wanted it rare it would be too soft ordered gnocchi alla peperoni sauce was completely tasteless and eating gnocchi was like chewing glue my daughter ordered spaghetti alla puttanesca came with a lot of very dry tuna but no anchovies and hardly any sauce both inedible and sent back at least the waiter apologised and didn t charge the main courses must have a new cook which might expalin why it was only half full great hotel but eat elsewhere
