i understand that the hotel is circus themed but silly decor like lampshades that hit you in the head because they are hung too low and carpet rugs that sit underneath the bed instead of protecting your cold feet from the floor are annoying also i asked for a quiet room but we were rooms away from the lift and there was a constant stream of people stomping down the corridor passed our room all night make sure you ask for a room at the end of the corridor away from the lift location is just that bit too far away from the main attractions we re very agile but by the end of the day the walk back to the hotel was a real killer
