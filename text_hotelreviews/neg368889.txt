room was very small the decor was really fun and different however it seems this may have taken precedence over the function of some aspects of the room for example the bedside tables were so low they were difficult to reach from the bed the lighting in room was inadequate especially when trying to pack our suitcases at night the shower leaked onto the floor and the window between the bathroom and bedroom afforded no privacy also we found the restaurant frustrating for guests as it was so busy that it was hard to get a table
