internet wifi was available but the server required us signing on every time we re entered the hotel it was also very slow and i think an upgrade here would be great especially when travelers really so heavily on internet for travel and itineraries using the lobby computer is not really what we want to have to do it doesn t optimize our time for visiting i think the towels are thin and it would be great to see an upgrade here i d be willing to pay a few euro more per night to have a better towel given the colder temperatures in austria it would be nice to have a small coffee pot for tea coffee in the room
