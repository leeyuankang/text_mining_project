i had an important client staying at this hotel whom i had booked the room for i drove to the hotel in person to leave flowers and a goodie back for the client i told the receptionist that it was very important that they take the flowers and the bag up to the client s room three hours later the client still hadn t received anything i spoke to the manager all he offered was a lousy apology and a voucher for one drink at the bar do not book anyone important to you or your business into this hotel it could be detrimental to your business
