to start we didn t get any help with our bags and the front desk staff could see my daughter and i struggling to go up the steps into the hotel nor did they help find the room or help us with our bags to the room the hallways are extremely small you can only take one suitcase at a time and the layout is confusing with rooms behind closed doors etc the rooms are very small the first room they put us in was so cold that we had to wear our shoes and coats while in the room we did ask for an extra blanket for the bed which we got but staff weren t very happy to bring we did ask to move to another room which was warmer but even smaller the breakfast was typical but food was cold and tough even the coffee wasn t hot we go to london every three months and won t be staying here again
