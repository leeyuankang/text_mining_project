the biggest issue that i had with this hotel was their wifi policy they charge an extortionate amount each day for devices for and it s not even very good wifi should be free in the first place but if you do pay a charge which should be nowhere near as high as this then it should be a fast connection this was very weak and files were slow to load and send i was staying there for work so this was a time consuming issue the signal dropped out completely one morning at which cost me valuable work time as i was dealing with clients in asia hours ahead so it was close to the end of their working day i called down to the front desk and they said would call back in mins after they d checked the control panel after mins wait during which i could ve taken a shower but was expecting their call within mins i called back he said he was just about to call and everything was now fine just need to refresh all devices i had to call back again minutes later as refreshing hadn t worked and there was still no wifi a different member of staff answered and she had a totally different story saying that yes it s down but should be back up in mins if not call them back and they ll chase this again i explained that it needed to be working and i was paying quid for wifi that doesn t work so she said she would chase them right away it finally came back on shortly after that the tv signal was also down during this time but that wasn t as important to me when i checked out they did give me that one day wifi foc but this policy service should still be revised also the chair in the room was incredibly uncomfortable to sit in and work for any period of time
