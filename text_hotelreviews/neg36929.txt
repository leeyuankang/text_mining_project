paid on arrival when we tried to order drinks at bar later in evening embarrassing as told no card registered even though i had had to pay in cash after minutes trying to sort out then charged us three times for room on bank account and took hours to sort out on our return home and a member of staff actually lied to me telling me this was common practice
