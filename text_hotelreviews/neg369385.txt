reception were very keen to know where we were eating as we were not having breakfast or evening meals in the hotel they were quite expensive no complimentary water expensive mini bar for water room was deceptively smaller than photos showed tried to ask receptionist for help in purchasing some tampax everything closed at and no where available husband had to get on the underground to a supermarket in the suburbs reception should have some emergency packets available in my opinion if more attention had been given to our basic needs sanitary pads and water we might have felt more inclined to hang around the restaurant more its all about the detail guys
