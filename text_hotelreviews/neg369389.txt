the main remark we had with the breakfast was the staff it was not really affiance but rather slow at first i thought that it was a policy of enjoy in nice quiet slow breakfast but then we realized that our order for eggs was forgotten because a nearby table got their eggs and they ordered after us after which i had to ask the waiter where our food was when it did come they got it wrong in the sense of quantity also the choice of fruits was limited
