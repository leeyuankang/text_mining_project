for a hotel of this price range i would expect more this was my tird time in this hotel and i think last one first i came with car there was no parking at all and they do not have vallet parking they have but i was told i have to wait min for someone to pick up my car so just imagine where to put car for min and not get ticket second they do not have concierge service so i had to leave my wife with luggage to carry it while i was looking for a garage for euro night in hotel i really expect more third they do not have breakfast in the hotel they had excellent breakfast but not any more so you have to go across streeet to their sister hotel i do not have to mention that it was raining when i was going to breakfast and no one offered us to bring us breakfast in room fourth bathroom needs renovation you can see it is few years old and it does not represent hotel in the way they sell themselves this room was not worth more than euro night so i think it is completely overpriced i really liked this hotel but it is obvious time to say goodbye and find something better
