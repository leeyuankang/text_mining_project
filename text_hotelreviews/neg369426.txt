i had booked a deluxe room that stated the divan window seat was featured however we were not given a room with this feature which was very disappointing breakfast is served in the sister hotel across the street which wasnt a problem except for the extremely rude staff staff were rude when it was pointed out that there were no glasses and plates left available in the buffet section we were ignored upon arrival and treated like unwanted visitors we didnt bother returning for breakfast on the second morning
