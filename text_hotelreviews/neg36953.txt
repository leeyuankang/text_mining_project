the first room allocated to us was in the basement which had no corded phone and mobile service felt like an isolated basement bunker we eventually requested for a room swap which took some trouble because we had to go to the reception no corded phone meant we weren t able to dial from our room to reception had to pay for in room wifi but was not much of an issue because i had mobile data
