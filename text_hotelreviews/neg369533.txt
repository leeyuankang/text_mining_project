small problem with restaurant first evening they were busy and said we could not have table service outside service was good but warm second evening we sat inside again and everybody else sat outside we realised too late and our service was terribly slow food is good and reasonable price second day we came back after having been out for hot hours and room had not been cleaned sat down for minutes then a knock at the door and it was suggested we left the room while they cleaned it as they had had hours we said no get on with it and work round us they did we mentioned both these things at checkout and they made a couple of decent deductions and very apologetic we did not find a lounge bar snack service area maybe we missed it
