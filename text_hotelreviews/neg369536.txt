compared to my previous two stays at the hotel the staff service was poor when we arrived we explained we had two rooms booked as my girlfriends sister was accompaning us to which the front of house lady was quite adament that we hadnt even though we had double checked confirmation a few days prior and had already paid in full for the room the lady then found the room and offered no apology as to how stern and adament she was at first dinner service was slow and not very good we waited about minutes for our starter and then minutes for our main both were ok but nothing worth waiting for breakfast has changed from self service to wait and order by the waitress which both mornings i had to go up to them to order as i was tired of waitiing for them to take my order even though they wasnt very busy i have stayed here three times in total and thats why i returned this time but i will be looking for another hotel the next time as the service wasnt good enough this time around
