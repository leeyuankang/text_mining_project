there was no one available to help with our luggage we were told to ask concierge for assitance but we found him aloof unfriendly did he think this group of asians would not tip him actually only a few needed the help but he was unconcerned truly the first time i ve seen such an uncaring staff member or maybe both evening and morning concierges had similar nonchalant attitudes the big negatives with your otherwise nice hotel one other thing though one house keeper had washed the drinking glasses in the room but was seen using the used washcloth to wipe it dry eeuuyyy
