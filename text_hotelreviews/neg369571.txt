no air conditioning had to sleep with the windows open each night to keep the room cool we had a room right above the street very noisy there there is a delicatessen across the street that is open until each night there is a lot of activity going on outside that deli and it gets very loud between that people ambulances mopeds etc street side if you want less noise get a garden view room
