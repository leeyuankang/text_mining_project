it would be helpful if the staff gave directions to the food market by the train station this was the only place to get proper food really early on a saturday morning unless you wanted to eat in the hotel we didn t specify our preference as a couple to be fair but we got single beds not a double bed the singles were not hooked together and if either of us moved into the middle the beds moved apart we stayed on the floor we could hear the people in the room above us walking etc this was very loud i don t think they were stomping heavy footed rather the ceiling could be better sound proofed
