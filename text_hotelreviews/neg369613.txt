did not tell me i had to pay a deposit on website so unexpected cost and hotel decor was like a brothel xxx everywhere from carpets to wallpaper down side of mirrors which is like being in your own window and a horizontal mirror running the length of bed a little strange and sleazy for a hotel in my opinion only in amsterdam lol
