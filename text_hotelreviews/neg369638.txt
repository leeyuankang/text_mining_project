linen was damaged there was a hole on a sheet i was surprised that during regular cleaning nobody changed it we didn t have possibility to eat in restaurant because it was busy by groups even if you want to order soft drink you have to search staff by yourself and ask about attention to you we ordered pizza in room service it was not cut on pieces and staff didn t put even cutlery to do it by ourself those issues are not so critical but annoying pizza was good by the way
