the breakfast was not worth euros it was not bad but i expected something more for this price i compared it to my last trip to norway where i only paid the equivalent of euros a day and i had a chef asking me how i want everything cooked also i didn t like the fact that my bed was not a double it was actually two singles pulled together i could feel the separation of the two beds in the middle every night again a minor comment but i think it needs addressing
