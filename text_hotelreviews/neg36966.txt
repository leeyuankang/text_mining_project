i usually stay at the chelsea harbour hotel whenever i m in town for my business meetings the only reason i chose the park international was because there weren t any rooms available at the chelsea there is a very rude staff member by the name of mia who made my check in a complete nightmare she tried to bully me into going to another hotel down the road that i believe they have affiliations with when i insisted on checking in it s one night only she sent me to the basement i had a massive argument with her and the manager who handled the situation perfectly i must say this girl mia has zero hospitality skills and is definitely in the wrong business
