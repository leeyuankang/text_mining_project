the previous nights here were ok but when i arrived at my room on the last night saw my night dress and the line for iphone was on the bottom of the bedside table they should be on my bed and on the top of the bedside table i did not put any stuff at that place before someone threw things there what s the manner and attitude of cleaning room like this this place is usually for shoes i can t wear my night dress that night and i had flight on the next morning i reported this to the receptionist that night he asked me to send email to the manager and typed the email address for me said the manager will handle this the next morning when he s back to work i asked for an explanation and a proper solution to solve this issue the next morning the receptionist then had no idea of this case so obviously they did not handed over cases till now there s no reply no explanation and any solution from them which is so disappointed this behaviour is very bad all my experience for the previous nights are good but this experience did shock me and disgust me
