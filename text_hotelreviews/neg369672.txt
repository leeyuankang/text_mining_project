the worst item of this otherwise nice hotel the water pressure was absolutely miserable the staff explained that this was due to holland being flat but surely water towers exist in holland too or failing that standard plumbing technology allows for the installation of a pressure pump as the hotel purports to be of a high standard it would not hurt to add this little trick to an otherwise excellent experience other remarks no aircondition our rate did not include breakfast the hairdryer was as is often the case of the weak sort the very nice and beatiful modern shower had no curtain or rim on the floor leading to a regular inundation of the whole bathroom floor several coffee shops i e marijuana smoker places are near to the hotel adding a slightly seedy tone to the otherwise nice area
