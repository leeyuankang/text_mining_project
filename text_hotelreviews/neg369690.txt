wifi was terrible tried to charge you for it we were treated like a group of school kids i couldnt change my money into euros as we landed late explained this to the manager and said i would pay when it was changed they took my passport as a precaution the next day we were called three times while we were sleeping for payment once at then then again at lunch think if we were a family or older couple we would have been treated better charged a deposit which again wasnt mentioned on the booking nice hotel if you are an older couple but if you are young prepare to be patronised and treated like a child
