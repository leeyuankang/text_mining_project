our room was in the basement so we had no view apart from a brick wall approximately foot away when we were sitting in the bar on saturday night having some pre dinner drinks my husband caught something out of the corner of his eye and thought it was a spider but unfortunately it was a mouse running around the bar and restaurant we told the staff and they did nothing about it
