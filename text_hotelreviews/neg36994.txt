we were disappointed when we realised that our booking did not include breakfast when we went back to read the online details we realised that we had been rather misled with the wording all inclusive breakfast available other hotels were clearer in not including breakfast in their deal and we chose park international because it seemed to include breakfast it s our mistake but we were disappointed and felt rather misled the room size was also amazingly small possibly the smallest double bedroom we have ever stayed in compounded by the fact that we were up in the attics so the roof sloped too adding to the smallness of the room available the window in the bathroom had been left open and because it was raining a substantial amount of rain had come through and puddled onto the bathroom floor the bed was at best a double although it seemed more like a queen again after reading the small print we realised beds could be between wide which meant that the hotel had not misled but it seemed rather disappointing the room was clean well furnished and we slept well so thank you for that but all in all i don t think we would stay here again
