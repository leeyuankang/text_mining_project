coffee was terrible although it depends of person as my husband said its ok but our friend even liked it very much hair drier is not strong enough also there was no cap for bath if you get room on street side then no good to open window as noisy we had some white wine with us but the fridge is without freezer and there was no ice available in the bar so the only way to make it cool was to keep the bottle under cold running water
