except everything is bad i feel only by looking its star hotel but not functioning wifi is horrible and when i complain the guy asking me to go down and use the net temperature in the room is horrible its like staying in the oven when i complain about this he is asking me to open the window why the hell they are maintaining ac in the hotel and when we open the window whole night trains are passing through your window and feel like you are sleeping beside railway track i totally not recommend to this hotel
