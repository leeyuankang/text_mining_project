it is not a hotel maybe the room was not very clean old outdated furniture the hallway smelld funny the breakfast was ok but not fit for a star hotel on the second night we found a bed bug on the carpet and after flipping the whole bed over we found another one hidden in the bed frame i know this can happen in many higher class hotels and it s not always their fault so we didn t panic but the lack of interest and lack of internal procedure for solving the issue was extremely upsetting we did receive another room though and after searching till a m we declared it bug free both rooms was relatively quiet on the street side of the building but every morning we were woken up at by the terrible noise of the cleaning crew s cart passing several times on the hallway not the best stay we had
