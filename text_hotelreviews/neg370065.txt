the parking is too expensive euros per day geting out of the parking lot is very chalanging because there is a big slope and the door opens automaticaly but very slow so if you arrive fast in front of the exit door the car s engine dies and you slip back into a wall there is a big turn right before the exit the coffee at breakfast was awfull a stars hotel should have an espresso machine it takes about seconds to have the light in the bathroom it feels like forever
