the staff is not friendly at all with the exception of the lady from the reception who was very nice and kind even though on booking it was double room we received a twin room and they told us to move the bed closed to each other if we want a double bed we stayed there many nights and the breakfast was the same each day even poor some days when there were groups of tourists the hotel is old the cleaning ladies were making lot of noise in the morning because at o clock they were carring some rolling cases for towels and they were running with them
