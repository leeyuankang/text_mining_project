the hotel is right next to multi track railway with sidings points and much noisy traffic i requested a superior room quiet with double bed and got an average room with two singles the bedroom overlooked the railway and if this was a quiet room i dread to think what the others would be like didn t get much sleep overnight parking at per night is expensive
