you can not leave the car unattented for minute infront of the hotel to check out the staff sais it s up to the police it was ok when i checked in the staff told me it s ok but when i was checking out one car was towed away it s true it was parked infront of the hotel the guest wasn t checking out or in and the staff told me i shouldn t leave the car unattened i don t know how you can check in or out if you re travelling alone and the staff can t have a look at your car for minutes i guess it s different if you use their garage for eur night it s not for hours
