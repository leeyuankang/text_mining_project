no wifi in the room wifi in the lobby was very slow and impossible to do anything even to read e mails the charge for wifi in the room was for device for devices and for devices when asked if i could disconnect one device and connect the next i was told that this was not allowed once i used the code for one device it was unusable by another since i had to have internet in my room business traveler i paid the gbps for hours but even then internet was so slow that i decided to go to bed complaining about it was a total waste of time breakfast was decent but limited for cold meats for example they only had ham and salami i asked for turkey since i don t eat pork and they didn t have it no boiled eggs either only scrambled finally there was a serious mix up with my reservation but there was absolutely no service from the staff i ended up being charged about almost euros extra for the exact same dates that i had originally booked my room through booking i asked for the manager but he refused to help me they told me to talk to booking which told me to talk to the hotel there was a fake kindness anything else i can do for you that resulted in no service anything i asked them to do they wouldn t do it but kept asking if there was anything else they can do for me overall the staff was so inflexible that were the equivalent of machines no human consideration whatsoever for anything you might have asked
