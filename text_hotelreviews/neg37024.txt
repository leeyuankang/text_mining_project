there was a mouse that had free run of the empty restaurant area from onwards it was skating across the polished floor and even made it onto the chairs to find crumbs etc so a friend and i watched it for a bit over a few beers quite funny actually until it made its way into the bar to clean up the peanut debris left by the humans i told the staff but they seemed unconcerned and said i could leave if i wanted which would ve been fine if i hadn t have been staying there anyway i decided to call it a night i went to my room and was then serenaded for an hour or so by a coo ing pigeon that lived in some kind of wooden box outside my window if i d have wanted to spend the evening with the local wildlife i would have brought a sleeping bag slept on a roundabout and saved very poor stay and experience never again however i m sure the mouse pigeon would disagree with me they were very comfortable
