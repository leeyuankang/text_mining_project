while the full english breakfast was good the food could have been kept hotter instead of at warm temperature free wifi was available albeit only in hotel lobby bar or breakfast room and for one hour at a time whereas it would have been nice to have that included in the price of the rooms and not pay per hours use especially as one is not in the rooms for hours at a time
