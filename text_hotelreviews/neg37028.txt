booked double room with a travel cot only to find that i ve been upgraded to a triple room with no travel cot i had to figure out how my month old son to sleep staff didn t resolve the problem for our stay operation manager is impossible to find staff is useless the cot offered from staff at had no mattress and since they were fully booked i had to either figure it out by myself or go outside looking for another hotel in order to complain you need to speak to the operation manager called rory who is nowhere to be seen during our stay i ve been offered off from my next stay but even the receptionist said you wouldn t stay here again right i wouldn t expect such horrible experience from a star hotel i would never stay there again and i would never recommend it to anyone if i exclude the travel cot situation this hotel offers nothing as a star tiny rooms mold in bathroom and flickering light in the shower
