wifi was annoying frequent dropouts needing you to reset your connection and login required each time you went to use the connection pool was nice but small and a warm day fills the terrace early with only a few places to sit staff were fine without being exceptional we waited almost minutes to check in while another guest was asking for extensive directions not the staffs fault and great that they could provide the assistance and then the phone rang which was answered and dealt with all with us standing in front of the staff with no acknowledgement location is a little further out from the main attractions but close to the metro and airport bus stop
