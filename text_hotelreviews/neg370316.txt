the room smelt very strongly of something i couldn t identify not bad but definitely not pleasant i would guess some sort of cleaning agent we left the window open all afternoon but the smell was still there but my main issue is with booking as literally my primary requirement was a hotel with parking so i checked this on the search filters to my surprise the hotel didn t have parking and i had to pay to park in a car park nearby
