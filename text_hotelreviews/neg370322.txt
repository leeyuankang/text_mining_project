water is only provided on the first day i don t think its a big issue but wifi disconnects every now and then and everytime its required to re enter the username and password to login again i would also recommend to add a door to the shower area for more privacy and to avoid the spilling of water which could ultimately damage the wooden flooring this is not criticism just an advice
