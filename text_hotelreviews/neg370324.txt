pricing is way too high for the experience provided at over euros per night for a star hotel rooms rather small and views very urban residential breakfast was poor and there was no other way to even get a coffee or snacks when asked for ice for drinks purchased they stated that you have to go outside and buy locally pool area whilst smart and beds comfortable is much smaller that photos suggest only beds and or chairs all squeezed in making it uncomfortable when many more guests wanted to relax or use the pool which can really only hold people sitting in it at one time no staff apart from person on ground floor reception it was like the place was self service most of the time except there is nothing to buy to eat or drink
