sadly there are a couple of things that really let the hotel down and would in our opinion be pretty easy to solve the junior suites are on all floors the first suite and not ideally placed next to the housekeeping room so there is a lot of noise from the housekeeping door being opened closed and the room attendants and their associated noise chatter our room attendants failed badly on the second third night first night we opted just for change of towels but nights the room was not cleaned properly mini bar not replaced toiletries not replaced all round a shoddy rushed job not once but twice after we complained to front desk things were fine but the staff on housekeeping those two days badly let the hotel down just simple laziness the second problem is that wi fi whilst free throughout is not stable at all and not only keeps dropping but can remain down for long periods of time if you do find that you are the type of person that needs to work whilst travelling this can be a major interruption but solve the problems above and you have a very good pleasant experience and even without a gym or pool you would have a good stay if only those issues could be resolved
