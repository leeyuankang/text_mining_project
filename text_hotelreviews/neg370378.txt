we ve paid for a paid early check in and they gave us a room right in the first floor when i asked on the top and there were construction work happening in the lobby that seemed that our room would explode but the manager was great and offered us a new room on the top floor like i ve asked in the first place away from the construction work and a free breakfast which was great not the best but at least they sorted it out
