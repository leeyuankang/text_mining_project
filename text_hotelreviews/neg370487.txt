miserable hostile ill mannered receptionist at point of check with glasses a young women her manner seemed to act like she was doing the world a favour also noticed clients that spoke english at first were treated much better i have read reviews from non european travellers about a similar rude attitude so this might indeed have something to do with the grudging service as my appearance would fit that assumption i left tips for the cleaning staff every single day yet still they left dirty glasses on occasion and would not replace a towel even though the hotel policy said if its left in the tub it will be replaced this happened four days in a row on occasion i had to mention it twice on the last day it seemed as a sarcastic way they filled the room with more towels the needed when i reported a broken bin in the morning the receptionist said she would look into it and get it fixed when i came home later in the evening it was left as it was i reported it again to reception the lady on duty cludia was flippant someone came up to have a look then said you don t really need it replaced but after further stress said he would see that is was sorted later that evening nothing happened phoned booking at ten and suddenly the hotel started to treat me like a valued customer but of course being as it was this hotel that too failed within minutes when a rude night porter came up and ordered me to pick up the old one and give it to him like i was his slave no manners no grace no apology even for the delay even if there was some initial misunderstanding which seems surprising since i looked up the spanish word for bit before reporting it it still dragged on to long next morning staff suddenly became polite at check out the reception manager was standing over them
