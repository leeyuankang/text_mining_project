the building was a lovely early victorian one with our room at basement just below street level i would add that we were offered the room with the three single beds instead of a double and a single and we chose to accept this the room was very good with lots of space and lovely bathroom but because it was at basement level it was cold the room had lovely thick curtains but ai night the cold seemed to permeate through the walls we mentioned it to reception on leaving however it would not stop me from staying there again
