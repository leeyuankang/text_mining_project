the free wi fi was incredibly slow around max i suppose it s enough to load text emails but not something i expected in there is also a premium wi fi i noticed being broadcast but we were not told about it so i presume it comes with the premium rooms finally there was a flat screen television in the room but renting a movie was more expensive than a trip to the cinema and the screen itself was far too small to watch comfortably from the bed
