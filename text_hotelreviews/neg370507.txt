despite being a four star hotel it didn t have a swimming pool spa or gym the checkout was long mins hard to find local cabs i had to wait mins before the receptionist could call a cab as there was no cab outside the hotel the hotel is far from the city centre as a guest you spend more money commuting to the city centre by taxi vs what u save by booking here vs some centrally located star hotel
