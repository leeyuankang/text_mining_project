the breakfast is awful for a non british person only english breakfast and some cereal and meager fruits if you don t eat pork good luck when you have the courage to ask if there is a non pork meat item a lady rolling here eyes chastises you and looks at you and talks with you in a diminishing way that you are not christian making you feel the discrimination and you pay for this food and the attitude this is a hotel in kensington and they should be more respectful people of other religions in food choice they offer i asked if there is no pork item or chicken sausage how dare i ask was the cold shouldering attitude just for scrambled eggs bread and disgustingly gooey beens pounds was too much i left and found a deli to have a croissant and coffee in the street in this hotel unless you are christian and muslim or jewish you are not respected fro you food choice ignorance and rudeness is at a level hard to match they have rice an miso soup for the japanese tourists and nothing for non pork eaters is this purposeful attitude unfortunately they make you feel so also wifi is from stone age i have seen faster internet that you don t have to pay in many third world countries
