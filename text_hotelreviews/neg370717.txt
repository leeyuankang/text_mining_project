not very much we would gladly stay here again on the sunday morning there was a small hiccup at breakfast as staff struggled to keep the buffet stocked with bacon and sausage from the kitchen the supplies ran out and there was a delay of or so it was c and not particularly busy there were no problems at all on monday and tuesday so this may have been a one off issue my adult daughter stayed with is in the same room the temporary bed was of a good standard and not intrusive given the size and shape of the room but there was no close turn down service and we had to unfold the bed each night also the room was not fitted out with an extra mug bathrobe slippers towels etc the matter was promptly and efficiently dealt with within a few minutes of our call to reception but the booking was clear enough so i m not sure why this cannot be picked up before arrival i appreciate this is a city hotel not a resort hotel but for the price i expected better
