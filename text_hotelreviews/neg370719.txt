check in didn t explain what facilities were available to us we had to ask about breakfast and check out times etc also we should have been able to use the executive club but we were not told about this and only found out at breakfast the following morning because we we ate in the main restaurant and not the executive area they also kept asking us the purpose of the booking and i had explained on booking that it was a birthday treat also we had to wait minutes for some of the breakfast components and when the mushrooms arrived they were cold not very good value at per head
