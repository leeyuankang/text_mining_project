i had called the hotel the day before arriving asking for an early check in i did not feel well and knew travelling all night would not help they said they would do their best when i arrived the staff said unfortunately my room was not ready but it would be in a half hour unfortunately i did not get a key until after p m we also experienced fire alarms two out of three days which were unsettling but i guess what can you do at close to a night i thought it would be a little more customer friendly but the staff was very nice
