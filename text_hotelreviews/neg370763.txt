no bath in room even though i booked with an infant there are apparently rooms with baths but you must somehow know to request one from a food perspective not child friendly and limited accommodation of special dietary requirements for baby and cannot heat up your own baby food due to health and safety policies apparently will only offer bowl of warm water for you to heat yourself which isn t sufficient especially if you must heat chicken or the likes fridge in room wasn t at adequate temperature to keep baby food cold
