i booked one night at the marriott london country hall and when i arrived they sent me in another marriott hotel in hyde park and the reason was we re fully booked i asked why did you not tell me that and they answer me with sorry but we hadn t a email address or mobile phone number and this is a very stupid answer because i couldn t book without those informations and i also ordered a room with river view paying more and obviously they gave me a wall view hotels are cute but never again after this adventure
