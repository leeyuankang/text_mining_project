we had to wait for check in which was fine we were early i asked for a room easy access as husband was disabled yet they gave us a room well away from lifts worse thing was massive scaffolding outside room workman all day view completely restricted and they didn t tell us after i complained they emailed apology nothing else this is an expensive hotel for breakfast a night we expected at least a nice view or a discount but nothing think they cater to the high end and don t care about ordinary paying customers will not be recommending this for a stay look from the outside staff were nice room lovely not worth the money
