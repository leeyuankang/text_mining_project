i requested a double room with bed but got x singles this was only advised to me on arrival there was no bath in the room just a shower i like a soak after a days travelling the tv in the room did not work the toiletries were meagre to say the least one tiny bar of soap no shower gel the tea and coffee supplies were again very mean no hot chocolate or biscuits and certainly no complimentary water the grill bar did not have some advertised items and beware the traditional sherry trifle it s nothing of the sort just a clumpy mess of coagulated cream jam and sponge solids awful the reception said they would call me back but failed to then do so i won t be staying here again
