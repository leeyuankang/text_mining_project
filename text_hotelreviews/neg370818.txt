i had two main issues one was that i thought the bedroom and bathroom were very tired and even the amenities were not great no turn down service or water was provided in the room making it feel like a star hotel the second was a terrible breakfast experience it took in most cases attempts and over an hour to make some very basic normal eggs it was the worst breakfast experience i have ever had at a hotel
