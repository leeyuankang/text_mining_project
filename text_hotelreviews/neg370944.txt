the level is supposed to be a star experience we even stayed in a junior suite and still had a subpar experience if that tells you anything the staff are not helpful they make you walk down for anything you need instead of bringing it to you nearly half the items i tried to order either from the restaurant downstairs or the room service menu turned out to be not available we literally ordered different wines at one point and where told they didn t have any of them the level facility is hardly a facility at all its an office with a small room available for peanuts whooptie doo they make it sound pretty exclusive so bravo to marketing but if you hype something up you need to at least half deliver especially with those prices if i could reverse the entire trip i would stay literally anywhere else because at least i pay for what i recieve for a night it was sooo not worth it that i almost feel robbed because i paid star hotel prices for a star experience if you like to spend a lot of money and you have low expectations then this is the hotel for you if i can even save one person from extreme disappointment i will be happy
