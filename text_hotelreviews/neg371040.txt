staff really rude did not welcome us when we first walked through the the door did not explain anything about the checking in process just stood there in silence then said done without offering to help us with anything like directions taking our bags upstairs where the room was located where all the facilities were in the hotel etc they were incredibly unhelpful when it came to directions taxis anything you would normally expect a hotel reception to help you with room was really nice and clean however the hotel was completely let down by the rude staff will not stay there again and would not recommend
