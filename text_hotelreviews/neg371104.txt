very disappointed with the hotel overall lack of decent restaurant bar breakfast no good hotel felt cramped excluding the room and the pool may as well have not existed the worst thing though was the location of the hotel at least from transport if not nothing in that part of the city and you could do far better elsewhere poor facilities means it does not deserve a star rating in my opinion only chairs around pool sun barely reached it due to height of surrounding buildings and it was so small there was no swimming at all
