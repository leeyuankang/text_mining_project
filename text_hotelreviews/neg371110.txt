we have been downgraded to a junior suite for our first night there just because there weren t any standard deluxe suite s available even though we have been able to book one for the whole length of our stay this was disappointing however the staff has been helpful and changed our room the next day moreover it was almost always noisy and there is almost no privacy if you keep the blinders open as someone else s room would be in front of yours it was a decent experience however it was not worth the money and did not match any of the review that you see on this website i would not book again
