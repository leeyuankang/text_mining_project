this is not a hotel poor service and bad location away from everything there was noise in the common areas every morning there were undergoing repairs or smth toiletries were not fully replenished daily there was not even a bottle of water in the room or some cutleries a maid slummed our door when there was actually do not disturb sign the worse of all was this broken glass partition in the bathroom when at some point glass particles got spread around the bathroom and we both cut our feet we asked staff to fix that but it was only done by maid next day so we literary could not use the bathroom that night quite disappointing and overpaid
