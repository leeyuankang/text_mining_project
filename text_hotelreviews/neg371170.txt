prices were extortionate even by londons standards breakfast each i was charged nearly for one straight drink in the bar there is a tray in the room with a few goodies on which is part of the minibar but some friend thought this was complimentary as it was next to the tea and coffee facility and were charged the earth for it very misleading we stay in london often and have stayed in hotels and never been ripped of like this before in fact we usually receive complimentaries expected more from a jumeriah room was small for a property check in process was ridiculously long and the front desk puts block on your debit card on arrival to cover extras given the appauling costs of the extras its easy to see why
