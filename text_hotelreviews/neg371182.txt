i was disappointed to find a bathrobe in the the wardrobe on arrival with old chocolate stuck to the back off it eventhough i placed it on the floor with the dirty towels twice it was hung back without checking and not removed until i personally complained at reception staff where apologetic and offered a full complimentary breakfast as opposed to our included continental breakfast which was sufficient however i cant help but wonder if it is actually normal practice to not wash bathrobes in between guests
