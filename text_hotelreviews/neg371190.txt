no where in the booking information or hotel information was there any mention of a security deposit requirement luckily for us this wasn t an issue but definitely something which should have been made clear prior to our stay there is noise from the outside until about mainly people driving their super cars up and down the road but there s an ipod dock in the room which can help drown out the noise
