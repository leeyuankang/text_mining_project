the staff was not very polite other then the womens and washing ladies were very kind and polite the restaurant is very small and also the bar had to go out of the hotel and move to another hotel to use the spa and gym which should have been a bit more information about we were looking forward for the spa but had no information about prices etc and its quite misguidence when you order a hotel which they give pictures and information about a spa but the hotel dosent even have a spa and food was not good
