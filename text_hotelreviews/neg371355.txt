the pool is a bit smaller than i imagined and there are limited sunbeds loungers so late risers didn t get much of a look in didn t make too much difference as there was so much to explore outside the hotel but might have if we wanted to just chill out by the pool however there were always some seating or bar stools to perch on instead it is a little on the higher side of what i would usually pay but i felt that the price was fair and reflective considering the condition service comfort and location
