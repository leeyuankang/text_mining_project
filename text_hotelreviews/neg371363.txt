our superior room had only a small window and was very dark our friends booked a standard room also through booking com which was much brighter and had french doors opening onto a little juliet balcony the standard room also came with a complimentary bottle of cava when i asked at reception for a different room i was told all superior rooms are the same also no cava for us and no real explanation as to why not it wasn t a big deal but strange to include it with one room and not the other so i would suggest booking a standard room and requesting a big window balcony the superior rooms albeit bigger are not worth the extra money breakfast was good but served in the basement with no windows there is an inner courtyard atrium but this was closed off when we were there at per person you can get much better value and more pleasant surroundings in one of the many placas close to the hotel
