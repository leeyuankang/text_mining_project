for such a certainly not cheap hotel i am sure the property owners can afford to put a toilette brush and a box of tissues in the bathroom when staying with a partner you can imagine how uncomfortable it is when one goes to the toilette and there is no toilette brush also the blankets should have full covers bags and not just a small sheet we know blankets are not regularly washed so no one wants to find themselves covered directly by the blanket without the bed sheet in the middle of the night
