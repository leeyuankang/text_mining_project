its ok with relaxing music but some places it could have been lower volum we were two couples out on dinner and wanted a last drink for the saturday evening at the hotel asked for a glass of red wine at time but the bartender denied us closed at we were quiet and polite not the best service and if we shall rate the staff it cant be score in general it was very good service at the hotel
