the service is terrible they first said they would change the bedding in my tiny single room then later said that they were unable to provide non feather pillows and when asked are rude about it and i quote we are a hotel we do not cater for allergies i contacted the hotel before writing this review and gave them days to respond and they haven t so i don t think customer service is anything they really care about if you have an allergy stay away
