unfortunately the hotel advertise that each room has a balcony but none of the rooms that myself and friends stayed in had any furniture on the balcony so we were unable to sit out part of booking this hotel was that we could perhaps sit on the balcony and have a drink in the evening but this was not to be why advertise balconies in this case
