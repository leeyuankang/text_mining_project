we had booked a room and sent request asking could four share a room as we where traveling with two four year old children who would share a bed we received confirmation from booking com that the request was confirmed by hotel and would be at no extra charge however upon arrival the hotel would not stand over this and an extra room had to be booked and children and parents split up not good service the room does say max of persons but two small children should be allowed to fit in with adults the hotel also had lots of stag hen parties
