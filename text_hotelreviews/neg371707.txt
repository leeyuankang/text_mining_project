being forced to pay for the room on arrival pretty jarring after a long hot journey when all we wanted to do was freshen up as apparently this is quicker than charging everyone at check out but but of course we also had to settle the bill at check out ridiculous system that meant we just had to queue twice as long there s a reason the vast majority of hotels worldwide dont do this despite the opinion of the ill informed staff at check in for per night i would expect a mould free shower taps that don t take mins to cool down warm up and some basic amenities in the room no kettle no iron bottles of water only in the fridge felt like a large hostel not a hotel
