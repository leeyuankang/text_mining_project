reception was always busy and staff seemed overwhelmed by the number of guests checking in or out or with general queries my room key stopped working and i had to queue for minutes to speak to a receptionist about getting a new key we ordered room service but didn t receive all of the food we ordered and the tea came as a pot of hot water without a tea bag our trays weren t collected from outside the room for hours when i had to ask at reception to send someone to remove it
