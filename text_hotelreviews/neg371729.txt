well now that you have asked we did not like the drunken english hoons that were terribly intoxicated at the roof top bar these persons were obnoxious loud and were clearly heard on poolside it gets worse these intoxicated hoons about six or seven made themselves at home on the poolside deckchairs and right in front of my wife and i one them lowered his pants and proceeded to squat his bottom onto the face of one his associates horrified i immeadiatley notified staff at the bar who intervened what a disgraceful act and right in front of hotel guests who were minding their own buisness the person who committed this obscene act should have been removed from the hotel and the police called but no he was permitted to stay never again expo hotel will i ever stay here for the safety of your hotel guests your staff should practice the responsible service of alcohol this is not the first time we have seen unruly and intoxicated english persons at this hotel years ago we stayed here and witnessed an english female who was so drunk she had to be sent to her room to recover warning to future guests to be mindful of the roof top pool bar
