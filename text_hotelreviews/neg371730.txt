photos in booking com only show the new rooms not the old ones that are not worth star rating our room was old smelled weird toilette paper was not new almost no shampoos and bathroom accesories no furniture electrical appliances cables were hanging out from the walls euros per night for this is unacceptable my partner had to wait for minutes before i arrived because the hotel wanted us to pay for the room at chekin when i arrived and asked for explanations all i was told is that is corporate policy unacceptable for a star hotel
