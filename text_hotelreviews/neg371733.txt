bathroom poorly designed in that the washbasin is too close to the toilet a large person would have difficulty fitting into the space the reception staff were very impersonal and not particularly welcoming there is a wide range of food for breakfast but staff struggled to keep up with the flow of guests so there were gaps in the buffet and people had to wait the breakfast area was very noisy due to the number of people and design the electrical socket for the kettle was broken although it was a bonus to find a kettle and i plugged it in elsewhere
