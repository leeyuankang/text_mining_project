two of the three coffee machines were not working on our last day the staff were brilliant and handling it really well but the management should give them the support they deserve by ensuring that the machines are well maintained and perhaps that back up machines are available since breakfast at this hotel is always super busy perhaps because of the excellent spread coupled with the reasonable pricing and being located so close to the barcelona sants station the rooms feel a bit small there is a changing room area which is redundant in a room this size if there is a remodeling opening that space out to increase room area would be a good improvement this was my second stay in weeks at this hotel yet again i noticed that the reception staff were not as friendly or warm or helpful as the restaurant staff
