the experience overall was lovely but there were a few things that i felt ruined our trip and weren t up to what i expect from a star hotel toiletries being provided one small bottle of shampoo and shower gel between people isn t great from most star you receive shampoo condition shower gel and body cream which is stocked daily water the hotel was nice enough to provide bottles of water in our fridge on arrival but the following days we only received one bottle using this water to brush our teeth and stay hydrated in our room temp was degrees that weekend and between of us meant this went quickly aircon when trying to turn our aircon on we felt hot air coming out not cool cold air it was then on the info in the room we read that the air con heater is seasonal so at that point in the year was hot air only which i found extremely odd at the temperature was all days we were there rooftop terrace and pool this is the main reason i felt our trip was ruined i specifically chose this hotel because of its amazing views from the terrace pool and restaurant it was only when in my room and reading the hotel info that i saw these facilities do not open until may nowhere was this made clear when booking in my confirmation nor on my arrival extremely upset and disappointed by this as it was a surprise for my partner and the weather was unbelievable our swimming gear unfortunately stayed in our suitcases for the trip
