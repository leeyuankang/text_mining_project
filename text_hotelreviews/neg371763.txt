out of date and very minimal furniture no carpets ac vents were not working not as clean as one would expect we requested to change our room as there were very noisy kids in the adjacent rooms but our request was not entertained it was not clear or stated in the booking that the rooms were without carpets or else i would have not stayed in this hotel the only bad experience in barcelona
