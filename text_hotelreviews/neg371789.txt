we were directed to what can only be classed as servants quarters which were located by exiting the lift at the top floor and using stairs to access a room space that was a health and safety risk this was adjacent to a boiler room which could actually be viewed through the ventilation panels the noise from this made sleep impossible light fittings on the headboard were unsafe as they were metal and you risked hitting yourself when sitting up not how described by bookin com and certainly not worth the price paid will be very wary of booking through this site again
