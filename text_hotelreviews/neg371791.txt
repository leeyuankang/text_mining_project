i got a beds room although i booked for one person which left very lttle space in the room the bed was not uncomfortable the pillows were but is quite narrow the bathroom had a slightly strange odour likely due to pipes being old and not well drained the breakfast was entirely ordinary somewhat bellow expectations for the location and price
