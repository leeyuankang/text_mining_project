a minor quibble about an otherwise an excellent stay we booked a twin room but were first sent to a room with a double bed this should not have happened since the booking was clear and furthermore the hotel had sent a standard email a few days before arrival asking again which type of room was required the desk clerk tried to say no twin room was available until a colleague intervened and corrected him
