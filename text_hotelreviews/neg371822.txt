we had to wait nearly hrs at check in to get our rooms allocated according to the hotel of the rooms had been cancelled but they could not say by whom we then had to wait for two rooms until for one and later than pm for the last room all this was totally unacceptable one room was a family room as people were sharing we were given a standard room with an extra bed so you couldn t swing a cat extremely disappointed in the hotel as i did liaise directly with the hotel before arrival to explain this was a special occasion and i did not want any problems also disappointed with booking com as this should not have been allowed to happen when i had a confirmed booking for rooms my special request which included details of the special occasion never got to the hotel via booking com
