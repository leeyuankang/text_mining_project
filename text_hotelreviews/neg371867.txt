the staff upstairs on the terrace were rude and extremely slow i was staying there for a week with a work related matter and found myself free most afternoons i don t know whether it was because i was solo but i found the bar staff to be very uninterested and at times acted as though i was invisible on two separate incidents i had ordered food and a drink at the bar and it took over an hour for me to be served and that was only after i had reminded them wouldn t stay again
