pool quite small although fine for cooling off which is all i wanted it for we were told that we couldn t leave our stuff on our sunloungers whilst eating lunch in the hotel terrace just under the pool resulting in losing your sunloungers if you get hungry the terrace at night can be loud if you are on floor so if you are wanting a good night sleep before then request a floor lower
