if you like a firm bed this is good for you but personally it was as close to sleeping on a plank as you can get and neither my wife or i had a decent nights sleep the breakfast was mediocre and on both mornings that we stayed the hot food was tepid at best what really annoyed us however was that the pool and rooftop bar was closed without any notice to accommodate a private function the reason that we booked this hotel was for its proximity to sants station and that it had a pool we had a full day out in barcelona and returned to the hotel at about expecting a relaxing couple of hours by the pool before going out for our evening meal on arrival at the pool we found it was closed and the staff at the bar said that it was because there was a private function that evening clearly the other people in the bar wearing their swimwear were also unaware of this event we ordered a drink and sat down with our books expecting to have are relaxing hour or so but after minutes we were told to drink up and leave why didn t they warn us before we bought the drinks relegated to our room we thought we would go out onto the balcony to relax for a while unfortunately there were no seats on the balcony so that was also not possible i did make the front reception aware of my feelings as we had returned from the other side of the city specifically to lounge by the pool and when a hotel advertises it s facilities then it should make sure that they are available unfortunately the manager wasn t available to answer my questions there was no prior warning of this event and no discount offered because facilities were not available very disappointing overall
