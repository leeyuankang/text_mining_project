avoid the bar at all costs our food was mostly fine but it took three hours to have lunch having to ask multiple staff members to take an order then for everything from cutlery to ketchup to drinks was a real pain but since half of our food had arrived we felt obliged to stay at one stage the manager seemed apologetic but then seemed to have stopped caring by the time we finally got the correct bill having received one with a few different tables orders on it it was corrected finally with no apology and they asked us if we wanted to leave a tip and seemed annoyed when we said no drinks were pricey also which would have been fine if acceptable service came with them instead of fawlty towers minus the comedic value there are plenty of alternate places in the area don t waste your time
