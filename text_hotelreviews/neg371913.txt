quality was okay but not good enough for the price we paid and the number of stars the hotel receives almost everything in the hotel except for the lobby is outdated the bed and linen are of very poor quality the bedstead was in shambles and the linen consisted of a few dusty old blankets staff were friendly yet in my view neither really organized nor really focused on the customer overall the hotel was probably very good back in the or but is now in desperate need of refurbishing
