it was a shame not to have any tea and coffee making facilities in the hotel room especially early in the morning and late at night when you don t want to be going to the bar or restaurant to get a hot drink we could have ordered room service but didn t the pool was nice although very cold shame it closed at we would have stayed another hour at least on the first evening we ate at the hotel restaurant for ease the pizza we ordered was not good quality for the price we watched the staff wipe down the tables with a blue cloth which had clearly been used over and over again without being rinsed as it smelt awful we almost left but had already placed our order the staff were very pleasant though the other odd thing we found at expo is that there are no chairs on the balcony and only one chair in the room so only one person could sit outside at a time shame overall a nice hotel and with just a few tweaks could be a great hotel would return
