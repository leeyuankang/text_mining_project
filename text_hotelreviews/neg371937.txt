the bathroom was poorly cleaned i could see dusty footprints on the tiles as if they had done some maintenance and not cleaned after the rooms are so basic old tv small cheap cupboard and basic bed the bathroom is cheaply furnished it is so noisy at night as the walls are paper thin so you can hear other guests and any noise from outside
