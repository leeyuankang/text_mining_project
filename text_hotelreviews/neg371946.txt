we didn t like the first room number that was given to us on arrival it stank very badly it had nasty unbearable smell of sewage and mould we went back to reception and made a complaint the receptionist didn t look surprised he apologised and offered two separate rooms one double and one single number and for one night and promised to find another family room for the next night what he did and we have been moved to room number night after i can not say anything bad about those rooms
