family rooms do not actually exist in this hotel we are a family of small children we were also travelling with my mother so we booked a double room for mum and a family room for us and we got a double room and a room with three single beds so my poor mum had the kids and we had the double room however the rooms were not even next to each other had we only booked a family room we would not have had enough beds this is after i responded to an email from the hotel specifically informing them of our requirements decor in the rooms were horrid restaurant was severely understaffed and food was not that great would not recommend at all especially for the price there is a better hotel even closer to the station which is times better and cheaper same price we only stayed for one night as we were travelling through but i certainly would never stay there again even for one night
