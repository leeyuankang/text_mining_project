room was quite noisy especially monday am i paid for a triple room but toiletries were only provided for two and sometimes i even had to ask for those also only two cups and milk portions were left daily i arrived by taxi from the airport and paid approx euros on leaving staff asked if i wanted a taxi i said i would pick one up from the corner outside staff said they could call one for me i asked if it would be the same price and they said yes the driver started with euros on his meter rather than the which is standard and when we reached the airport he added euros onto the meter price this was an unpleasant ending i had used other taxis during our stay and this was the only unpleasant experience
