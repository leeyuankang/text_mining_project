soundproofing i could clearly hear the person next door i felt a bit rushed by the receptionists when i had questions regarding the surrounding area or nearby transport it would be nice to post a map for visitors or have one handy other than the hop on and hop off bus map which is terrible for example to show how to get to the nearest metro station for example without being rushed
