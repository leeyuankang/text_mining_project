the wifi was quite a ddisaster the signal either did not come or was very slow especially in the evenings when more people came back to their rooms we had to go to the lobby downstairs to use it where it was better the hotel unfortunately was not a help in removing this issue told us that it was because the hotel was fully occupied and thus the wifi was slow
