very tired needs updating room was small and looked out onto the street so very noisy could not talk or sleep with a window open we paid for breakfast on our last morning and was very disappointing not worth the money pleased we went out on the other days for breakfast twenty minute walk into the main attraction ie la ramblas this hotel needs to get its act together as we found star hotels nearer town that were far more superior
