rooms are small even for the european standards book a higher standard room because you end up in a dark room near the pool it is not really a pool rather a cooling tub with very few chairs around no you cannot swim there it is too small do not book the hotel for its pool rather for its great location nearby restaurants and clean modern rooms bathrooms are also rather small the breakfast not great for the price but there is a very good breakfast place around the corner
