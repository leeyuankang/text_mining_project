the disappointment was the room we had booked for our two friends as an anniversary present was far too small to be called an executive room i didn t view their room until the day we left had i seen it earlier i would have asked them to provide a larger room which they show in the photos our room although large there was no view and we had to have the blinds down day and night because anyone walking passed would be able to see us very claustrophobic
