unfortunately we got a room with a window to an internal opening you could only see other walls in a few meters i realize that someone must stay in this room but i was expecting something better for a week long stay the reception area was being renovated during our stay which changed the entrance atmosphere alas the trip was also marred by the taxi driver to the airport who drove off with a brand new mobile left on the back seat the phone was turned off less than two minutes after and the driver denied ever seeing it
