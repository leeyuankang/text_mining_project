there was some construction going on across the street from the hotel which was a bit annoying when working all night and trying to sleep in the morning this was nothing the hotel could do anything about rooms have quite good soundproofing but against a jackhammer outside no chance but at least i know next time there probably won t be construction since they should be finished then
