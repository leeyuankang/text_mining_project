i didn t appreciate being overcharged on roomservice when i questioned it i was told they didn t have a allocated button for steak so i got charged an extra for hamburger not acceptable and not a very good variety on room service i paid for steak that i couldnt eat requested really well done and it came rare our room was across from housekeeping store so noisy in the mornings
