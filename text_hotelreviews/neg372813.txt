it was noisy late at night when guests arrived home the hallways echoed no carpeting and even guests speaking in normal volume in the hallways sounded like they were in our room we were awakened every night by later night arrivals once they entered their rooms however all was quiet again felt we paid more than it was worth breakfast expensive to us
