the tv was fuzzy every channel the location is just ok it would have been better to be a bit more central and nearer to pla a de catalunya you can walk most places from the hotel but it s at least a minute walk to sagrada familia and minutes to the beach eixample has plenty of lovely streets but the street balmes is on is quite bleak and dull looking meaning the view from the hotel is not great
