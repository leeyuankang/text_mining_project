staff weren t the best they weren t very attentive some were nice some weren t on tripadvisor all double rooms are with balcony regardless of if it is twin or king our room didn t have a balcony and when we complained after waiting an hour they offered us a smaller room with balcony and it wasn t even clean the staff wasn t very kind while doing this our room wasn t properly cleaned not a good selection of breakfast all in all this place didn t feel like a doubletree let alone hilton hilton should review this hotel more often and consider their contracts this hotel doesn t deserve the hilton name but has it s price
