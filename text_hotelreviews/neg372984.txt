the room was dirty along with the lifts being out of order the toilet did not flush in the room and the telly remote did not work the swimming pool looked good but after allowing my son who is to swim in the pool he came out and his legs and body turned red i had to shower him for nearly an hour to get the chlorine off he was extremely upset the fire escape we had to use was in my mind dangerous as the levels changed and the stairs changed from white to black this was confusing and could lead to people miss judging the steps and falling one afternoon we stood at the bar for about and left in the end as the bar tender ignored us the breakfast was not good as the cooked food was badly presented and not cooked very well
