staff was impolite we arrived with the child and they did not assist us with the luggage we asked for the parking place in the garage and they just gave us card with the location of nearby garage where we could park our car rooms need renovation we expected that they follow the hilton standards and from that reason we selected them however this was very disappointing we will never come again in this hotel
