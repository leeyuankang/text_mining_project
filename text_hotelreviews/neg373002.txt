very disappointed that both the bar and restaurant were completely closed due to refurbishment the whole time we were there for all we wanted to explore the city this really dampened our experience as we do like to have a few drinks in the bar either at the start or at the end of an evening the replacement area had no bar or atmosphere and not really any staff present to order a drink the first we knew about this was a letter in our room as we arrived spa and wellness centre was also a bit of a joke sauna wasn t even switched on
