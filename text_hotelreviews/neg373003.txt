the hotel has two parts my experience of one of them is not too good we were accommodated in two rooms in the part from number of floor in this part the corridor to rooms was very poor and old carpet and walls the windows in both rooms were overstruck by not transparent foil the view was to some yard we were not able to see what was in this yard because we were unable to open the window totally only to narrow spacing and in one of our rooms was spreading the very bed small from out through the windows the air conditioning in one of our rooms was unfortunately broken because of the bed small we were enforced to have closed our windows and due to the fact that the air conditioning was out of order in the room there was very hot air
