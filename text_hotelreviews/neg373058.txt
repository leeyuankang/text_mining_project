this hotel tried to be modern and with design however the finger print door opening did not really work for us only of us were able to use this technique therefore there was one time it did not work for my mom years old and she really needed to use the toilet and so i have to ask the guest relationship manager to come help us open the door and he was quite annoyed and rude maybe he was busy with something else but we didn t expect that kind of bad attitude one lady staff at breakfast was also very rude overall speaking i would not recommend to my friends and would not go back to this hotel
