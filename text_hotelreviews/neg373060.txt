furnishing in the room a bit dated no face towels and old bath towels no mirror facing the sink making it very awkward to shave brush teeth apply makeup etc requested a small vanity mirror at least but nothing requested extra towels none delivered requested some first aid disinfectant nada all requests to the reception were ignored without any response strange advice is to see the room before your stay in it
