unfortunately when we were there the rooftop bar was closed as it only opens in summer not sure why as weather in barcelona allows to stay outside already in may when we were there there was a private party in the garden on our first night with loud music until midnight that we couldn t avoid even in the bedroom finally there was no door to the bathroom and when we asked whether there was another room available with a door to the bathroom we were told that this was only available for luxury superior rooms it seems odd that this is a luxury in this category of hotel
