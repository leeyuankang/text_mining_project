there was a group of older gentlemen using the swimming pool sans trucks in the middle of the afternoon which was really weird awkward inappropriate the hotel staff were very apologetic and sorted it out immediately though service in the restaurant was a little slow but my only real gripe was at being charged an extra euro for asking the barman to fill the champagne glass properly
