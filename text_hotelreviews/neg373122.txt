the breakfast was ridiculously expensive as compared to the rest of my dining experiences in the city it was good just seemed unnecessarily high also my safe didn t work they thought they fixed it but didn t and never did even after being reminded also a light bulb was out that wasn t replaced after a couple of reminders last they didn t change the drinking cups in the bathroom each day when they cleaned all minor issues that would not prevent me from choosing this hotel again
