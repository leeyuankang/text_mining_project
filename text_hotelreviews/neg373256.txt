the room was very small and the window looked at the window of the room ft away so we could never have the curtains open yes we could have paid for an upgrade but we had spent quite enough already on the trip and were just at this hotel nights with not much time in the room i couldn t justify the expense and for the amount suggested for the upgrade i could have booked a better room to start with rather than going over budget on site it would be fine for one person but luggage sets created a very tight space
