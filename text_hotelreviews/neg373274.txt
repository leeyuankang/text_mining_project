we had breakfast one of the days we stayed in the hotel i stayed in other branches of the roommate chain before and the breakfast in rm carla wasn t up to standards the staff was moody my sister actually was scolded as she picked up a croissant with a clean pair of pliers of the hotel but decided to put it back again the woman at the buffet went nuts on her about this not a great way to start your morning and some parts of the buffet weren t clean the shelves from which you can pick up cups for coffee were sticky and unclean this is really a point of improvement for a hotel that in general is pretty fabulous
