there were a few things on the large breakfast buffet that could be improved for a start the coffee even though lavazza machines were present was average maybe it is the coffee the adjustment of the machines the water or a combination of all furthermore the prepared coffee from the two machines tasted differently this was certainly not the quality i have experienced with lavazza in other places the quality of the pastries for a hotel in a city like barcelona which is known for the quality of its bakeries was average they could do better the scrambled eggs and the bacon were overdone
