the rooms sometimes were cleaned right and sometimes were left dirty and missing items like toilet paper tissue etc the phone in the room did not work and it did not get fixed in the days i was there anytime i needed something instead of calling i needed to come downstairs the tub in the shower was broken so i reported it so i could take a bath it was fixed the towel holder was lose and ended it up breaking and hurting my foot my room was too noise having a balcony facing the street was not a good idea i had a bad experience with an employee named noemi who insulted my intelligence a few times asking me to call myself the phone company if i wanted my room phone to work that was not my job
