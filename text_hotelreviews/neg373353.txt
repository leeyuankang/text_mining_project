the hotel didn t have an outstanding sense of cleanness specially shower and hallways that although dark you could see them dirty and second but just as a suggestion they offered me a terrace room for extra the night i had rooms booked so only upgraded one to my disappointment it was the same amount of square meters than a regular room but divided between room and terrace so don t take it go to a regular double room space wise was much more comfortable the bathroom in this terrace room was very small it could not have people at the same time standing there the double room had a decent size bathroom
