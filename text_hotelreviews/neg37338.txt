on arrival we was advised there would be a holding deposit which would be returned up to hours after check out but i advised staff on reception that there was nowhere on booking com that states this i was then told from a gentleman sitting in the reception area on his laptop that in fact it does state this i later found out this man was the general manger he didn t introduce himself he was abrupt and arrogant which i felt was disappointing for such high class of hotel i was told the next day by the very helpful man on reception that he had checked booking com and i was right it didn t state this on there so i suggest the rather rude ignorant general manager checks things out before giving incorrect information maybe a course on customer service would be of benefit to the general manager
