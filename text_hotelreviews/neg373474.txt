our superior room was very small and the aircon very noisy i know this is london but for the price you can do a lot better room service stopped at pm but the menu in our room didn t mention that so a snack planned for our return from a night out didn t happen sandwiches were available but there was no menu for that we had to go to reception to find all this out as the phone in the room didn t work no action on that was taken by reception staff will not be returning here
