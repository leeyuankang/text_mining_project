there was a price difference between booking com and the hotel the hotel reception decided at at night after travelling for hours that the pricing issue needed to be dealt with before i checked in it is disappointing that when a guest is tired and just wants to go to their room that a minute discussion is needed over pricing this not the first time with this hotel
