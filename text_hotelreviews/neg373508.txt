initially i was checked in to an accessibility room without any notice so i asked them to change it then the new room we moved was very small although it is called superior double room it was really hard to move with only two adults in the room the door of the room was really hard to open and limited the space for getting into the room there were maintenance works nearby and it started everyday from thu sun at am inclduing saturday and sunday overall it is was a really bad experience considering the gbp daily rates i would not recommend this hotel to anyone worst experience through booking com
