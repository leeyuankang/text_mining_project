we stayed in rooms on the first night due to horribly noisy air conditioning systems in the rooms the first room s system made noise constantly we then moved to a second room where a loud buzzing happened about minutes after we settled down to sleep this stopped after about minutes and then started again minutes later we were then moved to a third room and provided with ear plugs as they couldn t guarantee the air con would be any better the following night we were upgraded to a lovely room where thankfully the air con stayed quiet for the night
