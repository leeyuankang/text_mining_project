d cor for this deluxe room was tired as an observation particularly in the bathroom due to the flooding phenomenon the air con was set to heat only following the cold snap in recent weeks and despite setting it to degrees heavily pregnant and desperate to cool down the system simply continued to heat the room this only really became apparent overnight by which point i was terribly uncomfortable and unable to sleep due to the twin evils of heat and a very noisy deluxe room located against the road on the floor final death knell to the decidedly below par experience came the following morning when the bathroom flooded in short order following a shower to avoid this the head would have needed to be angled to the furthest corner of the walk in cubicle rendering it ineffective for its primary function ie water on skin the walk in shower was the selling point of the room for me and i had spoken in advance with a pretty surly example of a reservations clerk and had explained that i would be nearing my due date and in need of quiet and a walk in shower arrangement she wasn t paying attention during the conversation and it became evident during our stay that my requests had fallen on deaf ears poor show for a hotel that ought to be punching at least to its weight and currently isn t a very upsetting overnight experience which unfortunately set the tone for what was to be a special time away before becoming parents again years after the birth of our first daughter
