our room was clean a nice size the bed was great the wallpaper was stained discolored which was out of place in such a otherwise pleasant updated room the position of the toilet was boxed in by the large sink awkward shower was nice size of bathroom also good lastly the blinds overlooking the street were too see through the door to the bathroom was frosted glass or something one could see the outline of the person using the bath odd to be sure the hotel was so nice in other ways i would go there again
