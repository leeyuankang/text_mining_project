the service throughout the hotel was standard until it came to breakfast the staff were rude an would not accept our booking even though confirmation was shown we were a large group as part of a wedding party and when approaching the staff about why we had waited over an hour for poached eggs on toast her reaction was i m not the chef so we all ate seperatley and most of the food was inedible as we waited so long for our meal we were also late to check out and almost late for our return train not to be expected from this hotel
