room was very small bed was queen size hotel windows were old and some wind was coming is and they offered very little temperature protection some sweets left near the window were colder that from the fridge the next day maid didn t refill the shower gel every day i would say it is a hotel that got due to a great location they bombed us with upgrade offers many times but we expected to stay out a lot and didn t care didn t know about the queen size bed though will probably stay there again if price is right also better have breakfast outside of the hotel as in the hotel it is rather poor and costs a lot more than at a restaurant nearby
