i didn t like the fact that at night i heard noise from outside in the street and inside the hotel in the corridors i would expect rooms to be more sound proof it s a shame the room is so tiny and there s no bar at the hotel premises i also didn t like at all that while the taxi from the hotel was booked no problem they didn t let me know there was an extra pound charge for card payments i specified i d pay by card
