furniture and bed are to a good standard the room itself was tired there was an old window which wasn t water right and condensation was a real problem with their being a puddle on the window seat in the morning this moisture was effecting the room as there was damp on the ceiling and above the window the window should be uvpc double glazed to stop the damp and also reduce the noise of wind and city life which was a problem when floors up the bathtub also leaked leaving more puddles in the bathroom upstairs for the price of a night you don t expect this
