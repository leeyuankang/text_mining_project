service is so slow we contacted house keeping for an extra pillow and some tea coffee sachets had to chase it times and even when it was delivered we never got the pillow gave up in the end after the room was cleaned for the first day the cleaners took the cups away and never brought them back we booked a table in the restaurant for the first night and it took over an hour before our meal was brought to us and whilst it wasn t the worst meal we ve ever had it certainly wasn t the best whilst eating we noted quite a few people complaining after our main we were handed the desert menu and minutes later a waiter came up took the menus off us and said sorry it is too late for desert and the kitchen is now closed just gone on a friday evening in london and the kitchen was closed maybe if they served meals quicker they d be able to serve desert too this happened to other tables too do find local restaurants for breakfast and dinner as it will be far superior on checking out there was a query on the bill where reception said we were due a refund but they had no idea why and said they would check days later we re still waiting to hear despite chasing
