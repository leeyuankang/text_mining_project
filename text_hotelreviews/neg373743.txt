general maintenance of the room was a bit poor from a hotel of this standard door of mini bar fridge coming off its hinges batteries flat in tv remote and shower that leaks out the door it was also frustrating to have the do not disturb sign on the door when our son was sleeping and then having housekeeping ring the telephone twice to ask when they could make up the room and then someone else knocking on the door another day to do some sort of routine inspection
