a high price for an edge of central london hotel that did not include an english breakfast within the business booking cost then the small print on the restaurant menu that then adds vat and then a service charge meal cost then much larger than originally indicated we have normally staid at the charring cross hotel or other then grumond hotels all of which were fully booked for our potential stay night hence the booking with you via booking com that then caused problems since you only sent confirmation of one of the two single room bookings i had made to me my business partner did not seem to have a room booked
