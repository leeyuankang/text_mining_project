everything was very expensive and the wifi connection was very spotty also the way that the rooms are set up with the bed next to the door is very concerning if i was staying there alone i wouldn t have wanted to sleep right next to the door the final thing was that there was no currency exchange on site we had to walk quite a bit to go to a currency exchange location that was close to a mile away not very convenient
