corny style rooms are very small it is hardly possible to fit in the toilette level of equipment the really worst was breakfast which is supposed to be served between and at around business travelers were waiting for breakfast at empty tables no buffet system we had nothing to drink i gave it up after minutes of waiting there was no staff no water tea or coffee nothing this is unacceptable even from a star hotel the hotel breakfast is euros and all you get in frustration truly the worst price value ration i have ever experienced
