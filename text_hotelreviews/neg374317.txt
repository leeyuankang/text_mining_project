in the room is a take away menu which states it can be ordered after after seeing central london and eating fairly late we decided we would grab something off that menu unfortunately when we called through we were told nothing was available by the kitchen called back to reception who informed me they must ve run out the night before breakfast time the staff were a little offish and i overheard one say to another come on get the plates moved i m not having them sitting here just chatting i cannot understand why we experienced both of these situations as the hotel was actually very quiet with what seemed only a handful of guests
