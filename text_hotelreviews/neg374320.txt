the window to my room could not be opened it was warm and stuffy throughout the night although the little fan in the room did lessen the suffering somewhat the walk to the room is very far and i cannot imagine using this hotel if i am any older or in the next couple of years when my legs and knees weaken with age it didn t help went the access card to the room didn t work twice as it is sensitive and could not be placed near mobile phones
