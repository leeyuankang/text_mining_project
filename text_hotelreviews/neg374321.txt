i have stayed at this hotel before and normally everything is fine on this occasion the pc responsible for coding the key cards was not working so no access to your room without a member of staff accompanying you to unlock it the kitchen were unable to do any food due to a problem with the gas and presumably this is the reason why there was also no hot water i understand that things do go wrong but i don t accept that it couldn t have been fixed over the time period it happened also the staff didn t seem to know what was going on communication could have been better
