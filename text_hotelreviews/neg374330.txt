paying for parking even though we was guests the exterior is shabby we had a long walk and two lifts to our rooms our room was dark with very little lighting in the room no air con could not open the windows very shabby bathroom the light on the dressing table did not work so had to get ready with very dim light no beer in the bar and the wine was awful the garden was a mess with napkins on the floor tables not cleared no table service guest asleep at one table noise of refurb across the whole hotel alarms going off very poor breakfast when we came down there was very little food on the counters once we had finished our breakfast they had restocked greasy cheap sausages cheap bread just very poor quality all round from a star could not wait to leave star at best
