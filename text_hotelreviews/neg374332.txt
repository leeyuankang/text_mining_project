i understand that they are currently updating the hotel but stains on carpet no aircon in rooms it gets very hot during the day even with the fan going constantly pillows were very hard breakfast on the second morning was ok but the sausages weren t cooked properly and still looked pink whereas the morning before they were all browned off nicely i think they were having issues with the chef as i could overhear conversations between staff room was good for what i needed one thing that annoyed me was the toiletries shampoo shower wash and body lotion were all half empty and the dressing table was sticky with ring marks but i cleared that up myself hotel does need to updated and so do carpets in rooms i m a hotelier so maybe i m being a bit more picky
