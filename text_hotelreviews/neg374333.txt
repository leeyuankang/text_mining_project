i stayed in a room which was in the church end of the building i know it is an old building so accept the windows were as old as the building but because of this there was mildew on the window concrete frames i expect this to look old but not with mildew this could definitely have been cleaned and was not due to the fact that it was old but due to the fact that needed cleaning better i am and have been cleaning areas of houses for a number of years and know what i saw could be cleaned the room smelt constantly of mildew and the smell did make me heave after sleeping in their for the night if i was in another part of the building i am sure my stay would have been perfect now i have mentioned this i am sure it will be cleaner in the future i have pictures but cannot work out how to download from my phone
