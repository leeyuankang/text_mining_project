this hotel states they have plenty of free parking it s a lie to add insult when showing the reference to their quote on booking com l was told and l quote free parking is free subject to availability however as we ve sold the parking rights to an outside contractor there is no free parking available i am a frequent business traveller and never normally write reviews however l promised the receptionist l would make a point of leaving one for this stay so here you have it oh whilst l m writing your internet is also about as good as your customer service skills
