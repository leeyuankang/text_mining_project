your website states that there is ample free parking on site however this is not true if you book through booking com and not them they have the audacity to charge you per night to park they do not charge guests for parking if they book through them directly when i challenged this and told them they could not charge me as the booking com website says parking is free they reluctantly refunded me and said they would contact booking com and get it changed one month later and the website still says parking is free this hotel has really gone downhill the property is tired and dated and needs a complete overhaul the furniture needs updating and they need to inject some ambience and personality into the place it could be a fantastic property if someone with a flair for interior design got their hands on it
