i didn t like that my bed was on the wall next to the hallway so i can hear and feel doors closing and people walking my room was incredibly warm if you have the window close and fan off the light coming through my door from the hallway was really bright and had to use a pillow to hide the light the elevator was really old and felt unsafe using it
