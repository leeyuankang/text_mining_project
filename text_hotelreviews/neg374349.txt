i was very disappointed with the bar which was so dis organised we attended a charity ball and stayed over the bar had no bottles of prosecco or champagne which seemed ridiculous as there was a hotel full and people willing to spend money as all dressed up attending an event the bar staff didn t know their drinks and ran out of glasses also in some bars you couldn t use cards only cash i had registered as a coeliac for the meal i was offered no gluten free rolls had to ask twice to ensure my starter and mains were gluten free then i didn t get any pudding and after times of asking they bought a bowl of chocolate ice cream which was awful i don t normally make a fuss but the tickets for this event were each and the hotel should be able to cater for dietary requirements esp as they had prior warning
