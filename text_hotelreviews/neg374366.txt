staff are very rude issued the wrong from firstly i had requested a superior double room and was issued a small twin room i contacted reception who was rude they then moved me to a double room which again was not a superior size as i had previously stayed at this hotel weeks prior and was given a superior room this stay was for two nights and the room was extremely smaller the staff response was we are fully booked which was not the correct response i was looking for as this added to my doubt that i was in a smaller room then i had paid booked after being told by the receptionist we could use a specific door to exit into the gardens to smoke we was rudely told by another member of staff that we could not that the receptionist was wrong or she had not told us that we could use such door and we need to go to the front of the building considering we are on the floor this is an extremely long walk
