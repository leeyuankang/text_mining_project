when i arrived both the iron and kettle didn t work due to a problem with the electrics they were eventually fixed but the iron provided wasn t fit for purpose and actually burnt through my jumper the room wasn t overly clean with marks in the sink and toilet the bed was a small single as booked but was extremely uncomfortable it was noisy throughout the night into the early hours due to a party conference i have never left a review before but felt the need to do so this time as would go as far as saying it was the worst experience i ve had staying away i would not recommend this hotel
