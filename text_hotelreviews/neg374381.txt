we were only staying at the hotel for one night and arrived late afternoon on a saturday the customer service was poor on arrival and it felt very unprofessional it was at this point we ordered a breakfast for the next morning and also paid our bill the corridors leading to the bedrooms smelt terrible similar to swimming pool toilets the bedroom which was a superior double was the most basic room we have stayed in and we have absolutely no idea why it was rated superior the complimentary shampoo and conditioner had been used and one had very little left in it the room was small and far too hot the shower was luke warm no mirror anywhere near the dressing table and the lighting was incredibly poor before our evening out we went to the bar for a drink and something light to eat we ordered at when the bar opened for food and our club sandwich arrived minutes later poor service unfortunately due to one of us being unwell we had to check out early which was late saturday night we asked if it was possible to have the we paid for breakfast hours earlier refunded to which we were told no once it s booked it s booked we found this very odd as it s not as if the chef had started cooking we will definitely not be returning or recommending this hotel very disappointing
