the noise from staff all morning and afternoon outside of my room room was loud and frustrating as i just wanted to relax and sleep but couldn t because all i heard was the conversations and doors opening and closing selection of tv channels was limited i asked for sausages baked beans and hash browns for breakfast and i got given bacon instead of hash browns i was too hungry to have to request to swap for the right items i wanted to use the iron however after i had put water in it it began to leak so therefore i opted against it which left me looking scruffy as i couldn t iron my outfit as intended on our second night the bar staff made myself and my partner uncomfortable as i was told upon arrival at the hotel that my stay included a meal allowance but i could potentially use it towards drinks in the bar but mainly because i got there when dinner had finished as we had plans to have dinner at another venue on our night i thought that perhaps we may be able to use the allowance towards drinks instead however the lady behind the bar was very confused the query was resolved and we ended up just paying for our drinks i have to use a straw and there were only available to use it sounds like a minor issue but as there was only people in the bar area and members of on duty bar staff you d think the small details would be manageable also herself a chap also working behind the bar and another staff member who i think was off duty were chatting among themselves which was very awkward as customer service wasn t a priority overall after paying for nights upon arrival at the hotel i just can t say it was worth such an amount
