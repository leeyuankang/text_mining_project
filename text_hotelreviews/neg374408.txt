i almost did not use your hotel as due to my travelling during the day i tried calling the hotel to book a room directly and was told the hotel was fully booked i then pulled into the next available services and went on booking com and looked for a hotel in the area and guess what the hotel had a number of rooms available as i have used this chain before and my meeting the next day was close by i booked it but i was not happy but decided to talk to the reception about what had happened by booking through bookings com website the room ended up costing me more than advertised on your website i mentioned to the receptionist at the hotel and discovered she was the one who had taken my call she stated since calling a room had become available which was a lie as the hotel was no where near full which i had confirmed by the house keeping staff who were very helpful there was no apology from her no offer of a discount for the extra cost in fact nothing not even someone to take my case to my room due to this lie unfortunately although i have regularly stayed in your hotels before as i travel around the uk and do find the standard of your hotels to be very good i will not be staying again having discovered the hotel was not full i can only assume you earn more for customers to book through other websites and so do not wish customers to book directly either that or your staff do not want customers and are happy for customers to pay more either way not great as a ceo of a company if my staff acted this way i would not be happy
