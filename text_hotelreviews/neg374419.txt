pokey little single room more like a cupboard than a bedroom with a a very poor single bed my colleague paid the same price and had an adequate double room for just under i would expect something better tried to change room but was fobbed off saying that the hotel was full breakfast was very poor so all in all not much going for it have stayed this year in over couple of dozen hotels but this one is easily bottom of the list particularly as i booked it in advance my colleague booked in advance
