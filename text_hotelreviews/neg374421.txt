there were no designated car parking spaces for the hotel guests so i was ask to park on the road and move the car at a later stage which was very inconvenient i was woken by the night staff at am and asked to move my car even though nobody had complained as i was eventually in a car parking space the reason for this was that the night receptionist felt my car might be damaged by hotel staff as it was in a space near an exit that was being used to clear a room they thought it would be much better to wake a paying guest than keep an eye on the people they had either let in or employ they also had no idea why i would be upset about this as they thought they were doing me a favour unbelievable also booking through booking com i was led to believe that i was booking a room that would normally demand a rate of per night and that i was lucky enough to get a discounted rate of there is no way that room should be per night ever i have tried phoning the hotel to talk to the manager but the line is always busy
