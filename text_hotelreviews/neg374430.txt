the restaurant launched a new menu the night i stayed and the kitchen didn t have half the meals they didn t even have soup or pate i m a veggie so had a choice of one thing that came undercooked despite us waiting over an hour for the food i refused to pay for the meal or the wine consumed i realise the hotel is being re vamped and it really needs it as its a pretty tired place looks like it needs a vacuum in places
