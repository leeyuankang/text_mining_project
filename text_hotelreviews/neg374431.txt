standard room wasn t what was advertised on the website being given another room to walk in on a naked man as you can appreciate neither of us were impressed i couldn t get out of the room fast enough the staff finding this funny when i told them no hairdryer in the room i couldn t get a hot shower as the water was lukewarm quite a distance to walk from the rooms to the bar new menu was implemented on the day i arrived however they hardly had any of the dishes they were advertising it got to the point when i asked the waitress to advise what they actually had to offer which wasn t much as this would be easier than me asking for things to be told they didn t have it i work away quite often and stay in hotels on a regular basis however i will not be returning to this particular hotel
