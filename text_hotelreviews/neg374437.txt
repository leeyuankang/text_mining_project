we booked a superior room but were given a standard room which was very noisy and hot the promised fan was not provided when we complained and queried if the room was correct we were told we had not booked a superior room we insisted we had and eventually the hotel admitted a mistake had been made we were then told that all the better rooms were taken the next day we were moved to a better room an adjustment was made to the bill but it was too little too late one member of staff was very helpful
