there was a bug in our bed the tv didn t work at all didn t have any signal you would think paying for a more senior room they would check the tv it smelt of damp and the shower was freezing cold although i put the hot on full there was woodlice in the room hence why i found one in the bed plus all the wood of the bathroom door was chipped off i never ever complain about a room even if i didn t like it but when i emailed the manager i didn t even get a response back
