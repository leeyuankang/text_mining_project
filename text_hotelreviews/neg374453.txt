the photographs displayed when booking makes the place look nice and modern however the rooms do not look like the photos and we had a hideous s looking room i did not feel comfortable sleeping in this hotel that i did not even sleep in the bed i decided to pass out for minutes on the tiny table whilst hanging my bottom off the end of the seat that was provided as you can imagine it wasn t comfortable doing this but i had no choice after being mislead i did not trust the cleanliness of the hotel and ended up leaving the hotel at so i could go home and get some sleep i asked the receptionist to get the manager to give me and my partner a call as they were not in when we left but we still haven t received a call and we want a full refund for the horrendous night we had at this hotel the hotel is very confusing as well and didn t help the confusion with a wedding going on
