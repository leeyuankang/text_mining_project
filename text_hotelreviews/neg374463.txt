i was given a room that didn t fit the description of what i purchased on booking com i paid for a room with a sofa which also had a separate shower and was in a quiet location instead i got a normal double room no sofa no shower and right in front of the lifts so very noisy when i complained they blamed booking com i advised i would leave a negative review if someone didn t call me back and offer me something small in return for not getting the room i paid for no one bothered calling me back which is very poor customer service they didn t really seem to care which made my whole experience a very poor one i expected better from this hotel i ve received better service from lower star hotels
