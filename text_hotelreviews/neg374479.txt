breakfast morning one went cold very quickly plates were cold too tables weren t ready at breakfast and staff seriously overworked at breakfast too so had to wait for coffee tea along with bowls mild and even a spoon room was a little too warm with no way of adjusting temperature as far as we could see not sure this is a star hotel in my opinion
