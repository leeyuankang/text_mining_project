rooms need air conditioning or at the very least a more effective fan in the bathroom as the bathroom was very steamed up the food was not always hot and did not appear as described on the menu for dinner the communal areas of the hotel probably need a bit of a makeover a very minor point i thought the numbers on the doors didn t go with the floors like most other hotels
