bad service in the restaurant in the evening food took forever to arrive in the room there were what looked like red wine stains all down one wall the carpet was terrible covered with a variety of different coloured stains all over it didn t want to walk on it without something on our feet in the morning when we were having our showers we had to endure builders in the room above us sawing hammering and making a lot of noise not what we expected especially when they knew our room was occupied safety chain on the door had a chain but not a catch on it to enable us to use it
