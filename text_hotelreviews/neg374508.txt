no room service breakfast terrible everything swimming with grease no normal toast horrible saturated fried bread fatty bacon snotty eggs almost in edible and certainly not worth the money we tried to order the room service at about and were told we couldn t have anything not even a sandwich i m afraid to say that this was false advertising and we booked so we could use this facility which was not available we did order room service for lunch which took an hour and a half for these reasons i wouldn t stay again
