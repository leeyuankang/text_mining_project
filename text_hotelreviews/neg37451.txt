one of the days we came back to the hotel at pm i was feeling unwell and my only wish was to rest the room has not been cleaned yet so we put on the door knob the do not disturb sign and went to bed at pm the cleaning lady knocked at the door asking if we want her to make the room of course we said no on the next day she met us in the breakfast room she was working there too apologized for not being able to make our room on time and also inquired after my health i found her behavior very nice and thoughtful i think the hotel is understaffed the same few persons must prepare the rooms for the new clients and also those for the old ones and may be sometimes they do not manage it all on time
