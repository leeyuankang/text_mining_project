unfortunately it was freezing cold in the restaurant we did ask for radiators to be put on and a portable heater was also brought to us regrettably some of the evening staff serving dinner were not very experienced and one in particular was actually quite rude i just got told to bring it out when we asked for custard rather than ice cream with an apple pie which we ordered ice cream was the last thing we wanted when we were still defrosting we understand mistakes are made but it was the attitude to the request more than anything else it was also cold on ground floor and another room twin was cold no radiators working
