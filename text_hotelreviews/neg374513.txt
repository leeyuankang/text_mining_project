the internet connection was extremely poor they allowed pets but would not allow the pet to be left in the room alone so you couldn t leave to eat at a restaurant or leave to eat even in the hotel as restaurants don t allow pets the bathroom taps didn t always work the power in the room kept turning off and we had to call reception to reset it every few hours when we complained they treated us like idiots then after tried offering to book us into another hotel which we packed for and then they said they forgot about the request horrible experience
