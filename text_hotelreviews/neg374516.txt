the hotel in general was very tired and in much need of major decoration and carpeting disapointed with breakfast options and the tables were cleared but not wiped between sittings plates where not always clean when put out to use toilet bowl was cracked reported issues with door cards when returning after a long day in london only to find that the card had wiped clean and had to do the long walk back to reception to have it reset this happened every time we left the hotel one of the lifts had alinement issues and would drop an inch or so as you got in reported hotel reception is like a tradesmans entrance not a good location
