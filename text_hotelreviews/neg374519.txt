cleanliness wasn t the best and the night porters didn t do a very good job of removing other people s room service trays from the corridors which wasn t very nice to see first thing on a morning as a night supervisor in a hotel myself i know what is expected of me the room wasn t ready for us when we arrived as i believe there was some mix up with our booking which wasn t the hotels fault but the reception staff sorted this out quite promptly for us which we thank you for the walk to the bedroom was a long one and the decor was very dated and shabby there was not a very fresh smell in the corridors which you might want housekeeping to take a look at dusty would be the word i would use we wouldn t use you again but you did serve a purpose and didn t cause us too much problem sorry for the rant yours sincerely dean mckechnie
