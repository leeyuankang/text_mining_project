key cards didn t work so had to go all the way back down to reception to get them sorted out the lift is very strange we were in room so most normal hotels would have a lift to go to floor not this one to get to from ground floor reception you have to take one lift to then walk round to second lift and press again to get to so you can imagine when i got to my room and the key cards both didn t work i was fed up as it takes the most stupid of routes to get there in the first place if you can take the stairs much easier but not ideal if you have heavy luggage also it would be nice when reception check you in to know what they are talking about we were told breakfast is extra and we had our booking with us to say breakfast included it also shouldn t take two staff to serve one couple we were left waiting when one of the staff could have helped us not a great first impression
