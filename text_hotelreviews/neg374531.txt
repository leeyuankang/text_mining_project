the wifi wasn t strong enough in our room i ended up having to use my phone wifi hotspot to use my ipad the decor in the corridors was quite outdated and worn out if this had a bit of a refurb or even a repaint and a fresh carpet it would have been perfect also the lifts are quite creaky and could use a little servicing i was quite scared it would breakdown with us inside so i used the stairs for the rest of my stay
