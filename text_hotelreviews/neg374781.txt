the terrace was completely dirty and never cleaned during our stay very uncomfortable seats no view not worth paying extra housekeeping is very loud and noisy breakfast is only three selected menus you can choose from generally a mix of very sweet and very greasy food if you are staying there a couple of days it will make you sick and wanna skip it
