hotel is small with small rooms more of a motel than a hotel no buffet breakfast located on a sideroad and not the main road housekeeping not great frequently forget to replace water soap etc facilities like gym restuarant bussimess centre are very limited had a terrace where people from outside hotel come and sit and stay past midnight and being in floor we hear everything which makes it hard to sleep billed me per tea bag which were located next to the kettle and free in most hotels not sure why this hotel got a fabulous rating on booking but thats what made me book it which i regreted
