the attitude of the staff is really dissatisfied i lost my wallet during my trip in barcelona the staff forced me to clean the all bills on my second day actually i should check out and clean the bill on friday but after they know i lost my wallet on monday they told me i have to clean the all bills on tuesday if not i have to move out asap i told hotel that my wallet lost because i was so desperate in this city by myself and i want to find my wallet asap however the hotel not only cannot provide support but also make me more hopeless
