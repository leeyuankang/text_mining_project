lets start with a price that i will remember as the biggest rip off in my life euros for days and i get that an hour walk to sagriada minutes to the nearest metro station for that price i should have been set up in a penthouse view looking at the sagrada instead of having to walk there for an hour bad bad bad oh you will be close to the airport if thats any consolation but why barcelona is a beautiful city just not from that view and not in that hotel
