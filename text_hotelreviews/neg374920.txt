there s very little to do near the hotel and the neighborhood isn t particularly attractive however being so close to the u bahn means you can get anywhere with ease also mariahilf is only a minute walk away be alert at night because the park between the hotel and station is poorly lit and we were approached several times obviously none of this is the hotel s fault
