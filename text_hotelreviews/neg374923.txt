there is no room service after or similar and the restaurant closes about the same time no food at the bar except for cakes and a really lousy pizza fortunately there is kfc outlet and a gas station with good sandwiches only minutes away the room has no warderobe closets at all just a small open built in cove with hangers one can hang suits and dresses at most no drawers at all one has to keep the clothes in the suitcases on the floor most unpleasant the garage is small and curvy with tiny places for each vehicle no way to open the doors without hitting the next vehicle frankly that garage is a laugh but they charge euros per day the funniest part the elevator from the lobby runs to the second garage floor only to get to the third floor you have to exit the lobby elevator and switch to another elevator which runs only from to unbelievable and ridiculous finally to reach the stairs instead of the elevator one has to run through a maze of doors placed without any inherent logic even though the hotel looks attractive it seems that the architects massed things out
