no double beds only two joined single beds not even the mattress on top to keep the beds together sheets are very small had to often adjust my bed very poor room cleaning they don t refresh floors or wipe dust so if you stay for more than nights you ll have clouds of dust flying in the room and lying under tables and luggage no care for spa area there is no even one responsible there so used towels lying near saunas finnish sauna can be cold they offer tea but nobody cares for hot water they also offer apples but nobody replenish them lobby bar is very sad no atmosphere at all we had to permanently ask for services nothing worked smooth
