maybe not the hotel s fault but the taxi they called for me charged me euros for the short trip to the westbahnhof train station which is just tram stops away it was a sunday morning at am so traffic was light a similar taxi trip in innsbruck or berlin would not have cost more than euros but this is just a minor point and did not really spoil what was a good experience with the hotel
