first of all it was so difficult to park into the garage the size of the parking was too small also the cost was per day for the car charge i have a disc problem but there was no service to take my luggage to the room was my first time i traveled to many countries but it was first time for me that a star hotel without a service when you want to travel your first priority that you to be comfortable the water warmer was very dirty and we couldn t make a milk for our baby the staff at the restaurant was to rude i thanks that s because when they told me that the room service will cost and i told her that i will come to the restaurant even i waited for half an hour to get my bills
