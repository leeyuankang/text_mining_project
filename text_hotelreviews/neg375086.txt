standard rooms in the second floor of the garden portion of the hotel were really bad that i never recommend them to anyone this part of hotel doesn t have an elevator and rooms are not spacious the floor is very noisy maybe because it s been made from wood we ve been in holiday inn for nights we had to change our room and for this change i had to pay euros more for each night receptionist at the first night of stay didn t welcome us friendly and it was not a pleasant beginning for us but after the first night every thing bacame better
