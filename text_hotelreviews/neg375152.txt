room was a bit small i booked king bed but was initially checked in for a twin bed room after my compliant it s immediately resolved the dirty towels even the ones i left on the floor were not replaced after the day this should never happen in a star hotel the wifi was a disaster for me it worked only in the first couple of hours later i had to call their wifi provider to fix the technical issue then the last day it failed again that time not even the service provider could fix it i just simply couldn t access internet with iphone
