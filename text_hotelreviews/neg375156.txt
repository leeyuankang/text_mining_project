few shortcomings first parking probably hotel has little own parking which is not enough for all guests so receptionist offered to use public parking about min by foot from hotel with nearly the same price eur day and hotel parking price eur day this is uncomfortable but understandable in this location the worst thing is that in front of the hotel there no space even for short parking to unload baggage so you have the choice either to block for some time traffic or park somewhere further and then carry luggage to hotel what is very uncomfortable furthermore that information about parking location you get only in reception and if you are not local and don t know neither vienna nor parking rules in vienna by sure you get some stressful moments second shortcoming wifi receptionist told that recently they changed the system and problems appeared in order to access wifi each time you want to use it it s necessary to login to hotel internet page enter your name and room number it s irritating but working with laptop but if you want to access wifi from telephone or pad practically impossible beside login it s necessary to clean beforehand telephone cache memory and change some other configurations i tried it once and it was enough next already mentioned lack of refrigerator mini bar safe and cupboard in the room small thing but anyway opaque window between bathroom and the room another shortcoming sounds like a joke at the entrance to hotel there are doors first is opening automatically and attention second not beside the fact that while entering hotel with luggage it s very uncomfortable this is very unsafe expecting that second doors will open automatically as well you can easily appassionato kiss them if not more
