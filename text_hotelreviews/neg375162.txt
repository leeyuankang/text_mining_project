no kettle in the room standard room what the heck there was a kettle in a standard room in a hotel in paris too little food choice there should be all day breakfast on the menu for those who are not morning persons like me and food should be standardised i had two totally different style of shrimp mac cheese lol one is obviously full of cheddar cheese and is very flavoured the other two times were the same probably from the same chef its more like mac cheesse but just being picky here why would you use penne and say its shrimp mac cheese just wondering finally i love the sauna honestly but where are all the towels for a cold shower for those who are not as thoughtful as me wouldnt have thought of it and might end up getting sick all in all other things are well thought about i m happy to stay here
