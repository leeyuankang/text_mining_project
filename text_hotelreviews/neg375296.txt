the official rating is four stars but i would say it is more like a three star hotel staff was a bit of a hit and miss some of them were good and friendly but others were not particularly helpful i am not sure whether it was a cultural issue but we felt some of them were a bit sarcastic when dealing some of our requests the manager should train them better on how to deal with the clients breakfast has a good choice and was frequently replenished but it is not appropriate for people with food allergies as everything gets mixed and there is little care in separating the different items finally a general complaint about hotels in vienna i am not sure why but they do not seem to have the concept of a family room we were two adults and two children and had to get a special apartment that costed more than having two individual rooms which would have been inconvenient families with more than one child may need to look elsewhere
