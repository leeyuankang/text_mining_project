staff was acting more like detectives and less like receptionists they were questioning if i used my own credit card i had to show them the card and even then they had a hard time believing i could actually own that card not sure what the whole issue was about when they found out that i was alone even though i had booked for two people they removed the towels from the bathroom i found that hilarious number because the towels are miniature towels they don t offer bath towels number what does it matter since i paid for the room for two people they started questioning why i booked for two if i was alone i informed them that i always use the same setting on www booking com besides taking the towels they never checked if there were any tissues or toilette paper so i had to call in the middle of teh night to ask them to bring them the receptionist answered please call back at am when the staff is here well since i had an early flight i had to insist overall if i don t take the austrian hospitality into account i had an average stay in an average hotel the interactions were comical
