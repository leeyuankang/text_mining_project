the house keeping came to ask the service we said no as we re checking out that morning an hour later around someone just opened our door and came in for cleaning it was unbearable as we told them not to and also we checked out soon the hotel really needs to do something to connect reception and house management team so they can have info which room is checking out on the day in order to prevent disturbing the guests also those staffs are needed to have proper training
