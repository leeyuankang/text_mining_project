we had a suite and one of the radiators in the lounge did not heat up hence the room in which my daughter was sleeping was not warm i spoke to the receptionist about this and was initially given a fan heater with a promise that the fault would be remedied the following morning i had a further conversation with reception staff but still nothing was done a black mark against what was otherwise a very good hotel
