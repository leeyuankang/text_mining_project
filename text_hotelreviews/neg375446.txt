the staff were a bit abrupt and when we asked for more coffee sachets we were told that we couldn t have any as although we were in a business room we hadn t actually booked one eventually theu begrudgingly gave us one more sachet to add to the that we had used considering what we had paid for the room this behaviour seemed very petty
