the pillows were far too squishy and had trouble with the temperature of the room the duvets were so thick and made us feel so hot all night on check in we totally misheard the receptionist and thought breakfast was included was charged an absolute fortune at the end of the stay although some days we only came to the breakfast room for a glass of juice i think we had too higher expectations for the hotel from all the amazing reviews we read online it didn t quite blow us away and we found it to be totally fine but totally average
