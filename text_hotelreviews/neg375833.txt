in the disadvantages were the lack of breakfast in our reservation and the lack of view but we knew both of them before our arrival the view was not required as we booked in the center of vienna and we wanted access to metro station the breakfast would be appreciated especially in the price of per night but taking into consideration the prices in the hotels across the city the value for money was decent
