staying at this hotel was a very unpleasant experience i was on a business trip for one night and needed to work from the hotel upon my arrival the first thing i was required to do was to block euros on my credit card because we never know what the customers can do once the check in was done i asked for the wifi password and only then i was told that the wifi was out of order at least for the whole day the only alternative which i was offered was to work from the hotel s business center which turned out to be old computers in a freezing cold corner of the hotel s hall next to the entrance door in the room the curtains blind couldn t retract and one of the main lamps wouldn t work i notified the reception that the light bulb needed to be changed at first they told me that i must be mistaken since i assured them the light bulb was broken they said they would send someone to fix it but nobody ever came
