they don t have a fitness room i like to work out and booked this room thinking my girlfriend and i will train but this was not a fitness center just a sauna and a bycicle in the middle of a really small room as well as a yoga ball really disappointed for this otherwise everything else was excellent super nice hotel with really good location
