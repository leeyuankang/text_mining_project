wifi was pretty much non existent in my room the most i got was bars and i only had reception at the door and one corner in the bathroom completely unacceptable for business travelers while i added breakfast upon check in out of mornings the front desk cannot find it and i had to sign for it which ultimately caused a long check out as i had to re explain the breakfast charges
