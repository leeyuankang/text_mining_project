we arrived on a saturday at about we checked in we had a reservation the man at the front desk told us that we have to leave a guarantee of for the room and parking the room on booking was we gave the man cash but we didn t receive any receipt when we went to check out the next morning the receptionist told us that we have to pay the room and the parking we told them that we paid the guarantee they had to call the night shift to confirm that we paid and after they told us we still have to pay the parking after i told them that we left cash at the desk the man told me that he is going to throw the parking for free a very rude thing to say after the night shift wanted to make some easy cash of very disappointing
