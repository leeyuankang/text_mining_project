two doors between bathrooms and other rooms are hard to be closed due to disorders we asked the staff to repair it but even after repair one door was not completely closed we were staying in a superior room on the floor but on every morning around am we were smelling something associated with breakfast being prepared at the restaurant on the floor this was bad for our sense in facing good morning i often use nh hotel in germany but have never encountered this kind of problems i would suggest the owner of this hotel to investigate disorders of furniture when we checked in it was too hard to find out the entrance of the hotel i think it is better off setting a big signs near the entrance
