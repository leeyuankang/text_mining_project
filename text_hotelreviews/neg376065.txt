this is a pension and not a star hotel wifi was there but no real access to the internet i stood for days my room was not cleaned on the day when i approached the owner he seems not to be aware of it although this is a small hotel of about rooms although their driver was workless waiting in the lobby they charged me euro instead of euro for the hotel to airport transfer as they promised saying that i should have ordered it in advance
