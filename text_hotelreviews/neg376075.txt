location was at least a minute walk from anything up to a walk the mattresses were awful and gave us back problems the staff didn t bring new toiletries every day despite having cleaned it i even found a banana peel left on the floor by the bed after their cleaning we were accused of smoking in the room when we had never smoked a day in our lives we had to ask for them to let us turn on the air conditioning and were told we didn t need it and the a c didn t work on top of that the staff was very rude and overcharged us for a shuttle which was supposed to be euros but they charged us instead every time you left you had to give them your hotel room key and they have a system of buzzing you in to the main room and your hotel room hall that is significantly annoying there was construction in the room next to us that led to pounding on the walls all day overall not recommended for stay find a real hotel
