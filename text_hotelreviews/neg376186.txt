i stayed in my room on two mornings and my room wasn t cleaned although the cleaners worked until early evening when it was clear it would not be cleaned a cleaner from another section and reception organised for coffee etc to be provided for the mornings as this was my biggest concern when i left as recompense my payment for the mini bar small bottles of wine and small bottles of water was waived which i thought was an appropriate gesture
