i don t like breakfast buffet i was stayed another nh group in berlin and it was very perfect breakfast buffet but this nh hotel it s little bit poor and expensive euro person but you can take any sandwich across the street and you can eat at your room eith free tea and coffee person approximetly if you buy from the shop and if you want there is a long table and sitting area on the street there are a lot of coffee shops around the street close to hotel we stayed night only day we take a breakfast we cancelled other breakfast amounts
