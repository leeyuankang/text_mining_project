for the customers who come by car to the hotel please write the address of the garage inside the garage because garage is very long please indicate distance to the hotel exit i m parked at one corner of the garage and then take luggage almost through the hallways of the garage after that i moved car closer but only after my own experience this is friendly advice very good hotel could be even better
