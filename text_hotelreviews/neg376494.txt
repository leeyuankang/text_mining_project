unfortunately for the money you spend in this place you expect a far better service which you do not get the staff was not extremely nice or helpful in particular there is a lady who we asked for directions for a supermarket and looked at my brother and i as if we were from mars we also asked for directions from the airport and thank goodness my cousin lives in barcelona and saved us quite a long travel time the worst happened on our third day of our stay where the cleaning lady knocked on our door at to do the room and basically wanted to kick us out minutes later we had new guests coming into our room since it seemed that the guy at reception had given them our room we were not checking out until the next day we never got a call from reception to apologise for this confusion instead we had to go down and ask what was going on furthermore that same day the wi fi stopped working for over an hour if you want to have breakfast it is euro per person extra every day on top of the price you already pay we already knew this thanks to booking however it seems ridiculous that this establishment charges for the breakfast taking into account the price quality relation
