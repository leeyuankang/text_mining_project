the only thing was the kitchenette area no kitchen towel washing up liquid or sponge most people travel with hand luggage only so wouldn t probably bring these items they should be provided also there was no soap in the bathroom i thought like the kitchen this wasn t provided until some turned up on the last day the kitchenette wasn t cleaned either so i did that myself but these are small points and didn t have any detrimental effect on my stay it was half term so the price was very expensive but hopefully next time it will be out if season and more affordable
