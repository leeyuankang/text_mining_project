for a hotel i was very dissapointed with the breakfast as quality was poor they had a range of meat which was all pork no chicken or beef the pastry range was cold and definitely not fresh even the coco pops didn t turn the milk chocolatey how is that possible and the room walls might as well not have existed u can hear everything going on in your neighbours rooms i was with kids clearly they will not be mute then the neighbour tells my kids that others r trying to sleep very disappointed with the hotel as clearly the walls r not reinforced
