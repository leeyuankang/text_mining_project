the staff are so rude totally not a star treatment they didn t care about ur comfort as much as money they blocked an amount on my credit card without my authorization even though i paid everything in advice and told them to never use my credit card but they said that they calculated the room price wrong so they had to block an amount without my authorization so so so cheap and rude i ve never experienced such poor treatment in a star hotel hated it never again
