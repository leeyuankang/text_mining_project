the only issue was the wifi in staying in a star hotel you would expect to have free wifi the wifi was only free in the public areas ie the pool area recepion etc if you wanted to use this in your room you would have to pay euro per day they did not specify if this was per device or if it was just for the room this made it very difficult to do any work while we were on our holiday
