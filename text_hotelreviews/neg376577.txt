it was irritating to know that wi fi is not included in the room rate sounded very strange to me that for a hotel of this price and class wifi was an extra charge similarly breakfast was not included in the room rate and breakfast would cost euros per person including children such small things gave my stay a rocky start as it is boring to haggle or get charged for small add ons when you thought you had already booked yourself to luxury i do have to add that when i expressed my disappointment the staff tried to pacify by adding in some of the things noted above i wish that i did not have to start the trip by expressing this disappointment in the first place
