the hotel itself is wonderful and the staff super so difficult to be negative but the prices for food and drinks i had expected with it being a star hotel to pay a little more but the charges for soft drinks and alcohol ice creams and snacks etc even around the pool were extortionate another very minor niggle only provided with coffee capsules per day for the coffee machine and when we requested additional capsules we were told that there is usually a a charge for these the capsules are each here in the uk kindly they waived the charges and provided us with further capsules please don t let these points put you off staying at hotel arts it is a truly special hotel and we certainly hope to return
