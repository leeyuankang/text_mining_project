upon arrival cleanliness of suite lack of facilities i e room safe not one anywhere room telephones the only one we could find was in the wc in the bathroom cigarette burns on furniture sofas and side tables and despite the property being non smoking the smell of smoke was very noticeable walking to the room i e from the corridor there was a distinct smell stale smoke and from quite a distance bathroom fittings hanging off the walls dirt mould visible in the splash backs and sink holes window seats filthy drink marks sticky stains and hairs on the seating which made you not want to put anything on the surface scuff black marks to the paintwork doors etc and generally an extremely disappointing arrival back to the arts for the time the above said housekeeping came promptly we were moved to an alternative suite once that had been deep cleaned and on a higher floor still sea facing overall the duty manager couldn t have been more understanding of our plight and was extremely helpful thereafter as were the rest of the staff to ensure that there were no other hitches during our few day s stay this included discount on the room for the first night wifi and breakfasts included and a very nice lunch at the marina terrace restaurant the pool area is fine provided you don t mind other people s noise and their kids but it must be frustrating for family groups to want to make the most of the outside facilities ok it was peak season but the arts isn t necessarily the best lay over for med cruise groups it simply can t cope with the volumes of young older generations and its limited outside space
