i ve never felt so unserved at a hotel of this category things went absurd at times felt like a charity event hosted by college students wishing a good day while we need to look for towels on our own or getting the coffe order right the third time is not good enough for a hotel like this do you think anyone showed the hotel or the room take the key and your luggage and follow the crowd to the lift the only good service provided was at check out thank you antonio the room needs an overhaul but the design is nice and the view fantastic american and verysimple food in the restaurants at the price of a menu in the nice spanish restaurants nearby overall a definite no recommendation
