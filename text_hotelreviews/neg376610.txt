we had a few problems with the management and reception we were given a twin room instead of a double room although we had requested a double bed two months and a half in advance we had to argue with management for a good hour before they finally decided to give us one of their double rooms weirdly this was actually the room that we booked so we couldn t understand why they did not want to give us the double room in the first place very bad manager
