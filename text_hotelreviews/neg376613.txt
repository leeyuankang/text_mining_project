no music around the pool at all not nearly enough sunbeds when there is plenty of room for more had to go on list for hours two days in a row music choice in the franks bar is terrible very depressing not a social environment at all feel you have to whisper almost it is a little uncomfortable no later night social activity at all no music anywhere nowhere to go after to enjoy a social night you have to leave the hotel unfortunately needs a party place to go at least drinks by the pool with music with the loungers removed and area should be turned into something special at night this hotel is better for older couples or those who just want peace and quiet day and night and who don t need a sunbed also over for a tiny plastic bottle of water in the room was i feel not value for money and being they are left out on the side you assume they are complimentary
