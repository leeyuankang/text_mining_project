i was disappointed with the fact that there were hidden charges euros per day for internet is outrageous euros per day per room was also unnecessary having to wait over mins to have luggage collected and then no one came so we had to cart our own luggage downstairs the staff were mostly interns and they tried their best but they were inexperienced and were being exploited in general the hotel was overpriced and i felt the hotel were taking advantage of clintele who clearly are of a higher income bracket so hotel owners naively think value for money is not important well it is
