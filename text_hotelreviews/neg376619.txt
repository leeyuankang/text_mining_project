the rooms were clean but not clean as in walls in bathrooms were not sparky clean we arranged for private transfers prior to our stay my husband rang and we email confirmed but no transfer was arranged so that was frustrating and not really acknowledged by the hotel a taxi was easy to get at and about euros cheaper so next time i d save the money and go for a taxi
