everything costs extra breakfast use of the spa wifi it is free on our local bus please bear in mind you will only get the room and everything else costs a lot extra making it extremely poor value for families they also took more than the whole cost of our stay from our credit card as a guarantee when we arrived even though they said we would not be charged and then charged a second full amount when we paid our bill we had to wait for over a week for our card to be refunded with the first guarantee debit so allow for this we have stayed in many star hotels in different parts of the world but this has never been a problem before
