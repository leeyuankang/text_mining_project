too much staff to offer a glass of water or call a lift but not enough staff at reception this hotel is really poor value for money wifi and minibar are so expensive the hotel is modern design but you arriving in the bell boy area and having to take a lift to reach reception is bad in my opinion the facility are small bar area lobby the room was not ready when we arrived we were travelling with our young daughter and there was no bed for her you book a room for and there is one bed overall the room was expensive and really not value for money
