the hotel is ageing a little carpets in the hallways have visible stains also bed made too much squeeking sounds the b o tv is great but doesnt show any hd channels also the music system is outdated it is not a dock for phone and does not support bluetooth so all you can enjoy on the system is radio and cds if you still carry them in this ipod age the parking on site was very expensive at euros a night
