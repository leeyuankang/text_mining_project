on the first night my room had extremely loud cracking and smashing noises within the walls all night we arrived late and were in bed already when it started so tried sleeping through it however at it was just too unbearable on calling reception to complain and ask to be moved they told me they knew when it was windy there were problems on my floor i asked why then knowing there was strong wind forecasted did they put me on that floor there was no answer to that i then asked how they would compensate for all of this they very cheekily offered me a discount for the night obviously this made me extremely angry and the attitude was insulting i told them that was not good enough and they then agreed not to charge for the night after this incident no management contacted us to see if everything was now ok with our stay and there was no follow up from the front desk so in a hotel of this standard with the reputation it has i found the way they dealt with this disappointing
