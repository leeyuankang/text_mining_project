the airconditioning was not working in our room we felt that the filters have not been replaced cleaned since it is summer and we have kids with us we made it a point to book accomodations with airconditioning it was very hot in our room my children had to take several baths and sleep in their nappies just to endure the night the carpet in the room was dirty we requested the hotel to leave the aircoditioning on in our room when we left in the morning so that it would be cooler by the time that we arrived in the afternoon there was no improvement i had to cancel our booking the following night because the heat was just unbearable the staff was gracious enough to call booking com and facilitate the cancellation at no extra charge and to offer compensation by not letting us pay for parking still it was the most uncomfortable accomodation our family has ever booked via booking com
