i don t recommand the hotel we didn t have a room with two single beds as we booked and i had to sleel either in the same bed with my collegue or in a very small and uncomfortable extra bed we both tried this bed and had backpains afterwards when we asked at the reception the reason we didn t get the room we booked they said that a bigger group had booked several rooms after us in the hotel so they were more entitled to rooms with single beds that we were because they were paying more this is not a good reason for me
