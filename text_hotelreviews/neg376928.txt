staff was not very helpful when we just arrived in the hotel at mid night it was very cold almost degree the moment we opened the door to our room it was so cold because the window was open the room was small but it still took a long time to warm the room up after we turned the heating on when i complained to the receptionist he said well i cannot tell you why the window was open all right i didn t expect that
