wifi is expensive and barely usable for business purposes or video streaming bandwidth limited to mobile roaming was fast and cheaper on my company contract place missed to put my desk address on the invoice even though discussed before missed out on that myself due complaining on the unclear and very wifi offers even though this place is in itself nice except for the dirty carpets in my room not being able to work in my room without roaming overuse is just giving the whole experience an totally unnecessary note will likely not book leonardo hotels again
