watch out for the internet access it costs eur for and it is close to not being usable the garage is a nightmare especially if you own a bigger car than vw golf for any sort of limousine or bigger driving in and out turns into a half an hour endeavour i realise one tries to use as much space as possible but it was just too much i managed to scratch my car by driving out and it is not for the lack of experience or due to speed at the end if you look at the wall close to the exit you will see a whole palette of colours perhaps making one door instead of two and introducing a traffic light system would be a solution
