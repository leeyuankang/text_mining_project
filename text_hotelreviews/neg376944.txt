the bathroom door was frosted glass and sometimes didn t stay closed which meant that using the bathroom wasn t particularly private paying extra for internet that i had to update every hours and refresh everytime i used a device was inconvenient if i was traveling for leisure this might not have mattered so much it was also annoying to be restricted to only two devices or pay extra the room was on the small side
