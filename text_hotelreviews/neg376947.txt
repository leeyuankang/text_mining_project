the triple room actually is a double bed plus a pull out bed a pull out bed is not comfortable and takes much space in the room not comfortable and not recommended for adults staying in that room they shouldn t have that option at the first place in my opinion very small shower glass cubicle the bathroom is ok driveway to the parking lot is very small can t accommodate seats van need to park somewhere else if you drive one
