the receptionist was very incompetent uncooperative and impolite she was late ordering my taxi despite prior notice and was very rude to me so i arrived late at the airport when i first arrived i was shocked when i entered my room because it had a low slanted ceiling like an attic so i called the recetionist and asked to change the room because this gives me shortness of breath and her response was basically deal with it
