wifi wasn t very strong which was frustrating and you could only have devices connected at any time wifi should be accessible and free to all patrons breakfast no toasting facility for bread could have had a few more options e g cooked tomatoes otherwise ok location was too far from the centre and had less soul though we found good restaurants nearby that were a bit off the beaten track e g hawider great little burger and beer joint and mill really good food and nice interior
