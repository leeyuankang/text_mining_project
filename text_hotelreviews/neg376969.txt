the beds were not overly soft and mattresses felt old the springs could be felt they were not uncomfortable but not luxurious either there was also a previously filled out comment card over a week old based on the date the writer put left in the room binder and the soap unit in the shower was empty this leads me to think that while the room looked clean the housekeeping may not be as thorough as i would expect
