this hotel is rather strange compared to others in vienna issue no leonardo hotel does not have free wifi in the rooms that is absolutely unacceptable in the modern world issue no even when you buy paid wifi connection for hrs it works very slow in addition their paid connection only works for two devices a day if you log into devices in the morning you cannot use wifi on other devices in the course of the day issue no the hotel is located rather far from the center of vienna
