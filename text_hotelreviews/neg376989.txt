i am really surprised that a star hotel doesn t offer free wi fi to its guests we got one hour for free and the wifi connection was slow and disconnected often it almost wasn t worth using i wouldn t bother to pay euros a day to use the suboptimal wifi another major issue is that the walls are paper thin so we could hear everything from our neighbors on either side of us one neighbor spoke italian another english we could clearly hear them playing music at night or chatting in the morning there s also noise from the hallway lastly the toiletries in the hotel are bare bones there is a liquid hand soap next to the sink and a shampoo body soap combo in the stand up shower
