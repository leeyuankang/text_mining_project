the staff although not too unpleasant to myself or my partner were very rude to some guests regarding small scale questions and issues the staff can make or break a stay at a hotel the wifi was also a disappointment first you have to pay for hours and it didn t even work on the second floor this was mentioned to the staff twice and they eventually gave us a new wifi voucher which also did not work it would have been nice to eat at the hotel however we were told the restaurant is only for group tours
