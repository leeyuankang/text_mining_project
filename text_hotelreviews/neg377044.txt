there was mold in bathroom there seemed to be an issue with ac as it randomly shut off after a few minutes leaving the room rather uncomfortable the tv had a similar issue where it would not completely shut off but go to a blue screen leaving us unable to shut it off completely and it would then stay like this for several hours sometimes
