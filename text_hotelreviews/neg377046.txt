the staff at breakfast were a bit ridiculous we were in a rush to sit down and eat as we had to check out and leave not long after we ate we told them we wanted to pay for the two of us to have breakfast and the man behind the counter couldn t understand what we were saying even though we were holding money to show him he then called over another staff member and we told her we would like to pay for the breakfast she then called over another staff member who finally took our money and let us eat it took about minutes for a minute job to be done and it was all a bit ridiculous
