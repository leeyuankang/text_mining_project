wifi in rooms is per day i can t remember that i have stayed lately in some hotel which charges this service there are computers in the lobby with free internet true but so early we took non refundable offer and the room was small with tiny bathroom and not so nice view we stayed just two nights after our great summer vacation so we didn t want to bother with complaining not so bad hotel in general but my worst hotel decision
