i will never come back here because of staff attitude it all comes on check in which was disaster firstly they asked me for guarantee i gave them my gold visa card but then it appeared that i have to pay advance they treated us like scam although it was my visit of this hotel then every time before we got a free internet this time they charged it when i told about my disappointment nobody paid attention at the check out day room service times came in our room in early morning and disturb us so we were tired and exhausted on our way back from every angle it was horrible accommodation
