the air conditioning system could be better maintained it was a little bit stinky on the corridors from time to time a water in the shower had a little bit unstable temperature sometimes it needed few minutes to stabilize between cold and hot the shower cubicle had small traces of dirt as far as i remember there was no option to turn on off the main light using bed switches it s slightly inconvenient but not a big deal the room was quite small but comfortable
