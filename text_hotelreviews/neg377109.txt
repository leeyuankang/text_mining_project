i have been to this hotel before because location is perfect for me but there are few things i dont like cleaning was better than last time but stil there was horrible smell inside the shower there was missing reading light by the armchair too dark and nobody told me there is a fitnes n relax lounge on the floor which is really shame cos i have been here a few times before and could have use it before
