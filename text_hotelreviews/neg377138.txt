the hotel receives an extra point for having its own parking however the access to it is way too narrow was a bit nervous before leaving the garage but did feel comfortable knowing that my car is in a safe place another minus would be the omlette which did not seemed to be made out of fresh eggs but rather from powdered ones its a pity because overall the food was good including the pancakes
