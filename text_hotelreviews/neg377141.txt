they have an underground parking for a night to be honest is terrible i do not suggest to park there because i personally have scratched my car i m attaching some pictures where you can see that all the walls and doors are damaged because of the small space with a door saloon car you have to be carelful about entering and leaving the parking i told the hotel s stuff what happend and they do not care they told me that they do not have complains and i should fix my car on my ensurance also they told me that the parking is not theirs is rented and they are not reaponsable for any damages now my question is why pay night for a service that a good hotel shoud offer for free in the proce for the room shirtly said i was dissapointed because there was no manager yo talk to and the ladies from the reception are not helpful at all my personal opinion is that is a pitty that one nice hotel chain like leonardo having a good image has to suffer because of some small problems that are able to fix my sugestion is please fix and enlarge the entry from each floor of the parking
