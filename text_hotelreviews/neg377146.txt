stuff is not very friendly in the morning we announced that we will leave the car in the garage but when we arrived there was no free space although it was said we don t have to reserve it after us a few more cars came and no one had nowhere to park totaly chaos and not to mention that garage is awful lack of parking space so narrow that you have to be very careful not to scratch your car
