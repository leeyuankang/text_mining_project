the superior rooms were so small and the bathroom had sliding glass doors which you can see people sitting on the toilet and showering the glass door didn t fit properly which meant there was a half inch gap between the door and wall when shut you could see quite clearly into the room no proper clothes space we were told there was a restaurant but it was only for breakfast which made christmas difficult for meals the free wifi was never working throughout the stay of days and as we had to upgrade to a suite for more space we were supposed to have high speed wifi in the room this was non existence very disappointed and would have moved straight away to another hotel if we hadn t already paid in full for our stay
