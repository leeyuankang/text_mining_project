as with most hotels in vienna breakfast is not included it costs and i found it quite mediocre fortunately there are plenty of caf s in the neighbourhood the bathroom also felt a bit small for a superior suite the shower was fine but the washbasin and the area around it was a bit cramped but it s a small matter over all i was very pleased with my stay
