when we rung from reception for any items we were told to come to reception we were on the seventh floor so it was very frustrating even just to get wifi we had to go down staff were friendly to a point we have often been in hotels where the staff are more than willing to give you ideas on where to eat sight see and i found if asking any questions we were imposing on them overall lovely hotel i guess it s not nice when you feel welcomed at times we felt we were intruding by asking for things etc
