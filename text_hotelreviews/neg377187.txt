when i made the booking booking com said the wi fi is free but it turned out otherwise i made a complaint to booking com then they replied that their page didn t said it s free i provided proof that they changed the desciption after i made the complaint and then they apologized and offered to refund the wi fi charge still it s very short sighted for a star hotel to charge eur per day for the wi fi there are plenty of hotels with free wi fi in the area not to say in vienna
