the staff were quite underwhelming in terms of being welcoming or accomodating they had a doorman who just stood there and watched as we struggled in the door with our bags he also didn t help with taking bags to the room so not sure what he s paid to do we sat downstairs at the bar for like minutes without anyone coming past to greet us or take an order they weren t busy no one else was there but they were open so we ended up leaving disappointing staff
