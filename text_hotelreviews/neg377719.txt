double bed is actually two single beds attached together i asked to change the room because i had thought that these are actually twin rooms but i was said that all the rooms are the same there are no telephones and mini bars in the room which is extremely inconvenient expecially if you live on the floor the location of the hotel is not ideal too far from everything
