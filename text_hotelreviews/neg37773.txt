nobody offered me help with my luggage on arrival nor on my departure so i had to struggle all alone with my heavy suitcases not once was i offered any assistance from the staff very poor service the bathroom was awful the shower over the bath is very old fashioned i ordered a club sandwich from room service which wasn t good at all the lettuce was wilted and brown and the turkey was unevenly cut the fries were good but then again those were probably pre cut and frozen i stayed for nights each night my room was made up differently i strongly believe that a hotel should have consistencey the bed should be made in the same way every time and the pillows fluffed to perfection
