location was horrible i booked it as an airport hotel and the taxi cost eu from the airport it was in the middle of an industrial area complete with steaming smokestacks and featureless buildings there were no other options for eating outside the hotel within a minute walk and it didn t feel safe enough in the dark there was no area for the taxi to pull up to the door so i had to drag my bags from the street not a long distance but not what i wanted to do at pm the wireless was not very good could hear people in the hallway very clearly
