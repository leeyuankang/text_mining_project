i have been very seriously disappointed because i asked the receptionist to book a taxi to the airport result was an black taxi with no meter no receipt and a ridiculously expensive cost tried to negotiate unsuccessfully it seemed to be the part of the cake was for the hotel receptionist very unfair and disappointing
