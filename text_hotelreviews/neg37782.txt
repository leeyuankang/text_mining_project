we were offered an upgrade for an extra eur including breakfast better room and access to the executive lounge where drinks and cocktails are served from to don t be seduced the lounge is a tiny attic room which has only rank wine and old canapes the room wasnt much better than on previous stays and the breakfast is bad value
