not only did the staff on arrival ask to copy the details of my credit card this is ok but they also noted down the cvv number from the back of the credit card this means that the hotel has all the information to use my credit card for internet purchases since this is unacceptable i asked the receptionist to delete the cvv but she refused this policy should be changed otherwise good hotel
