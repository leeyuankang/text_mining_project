no alcohol served here although there are bars and pubs nearby we ate at the restaurant and had a wonderful server but the food was not very good and pretty expensive breakfast was good but at each is overpriced we had to move rooms twice because of a heavy smell of natural gas or butane on that side of the building the staff moved us quickly each time and all staff was kind and professional about moving us small drawbacks and we would still stay again
