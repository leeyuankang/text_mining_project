the hotel isn t honest on its website you are led to believe they serve alcohol but in fact they lost their licence in and instead of being honest when we asked why they don t serve any they lied to our face told us the fridge in our room wasn t working so we was unable to have a beer from the fridge although it s a non alcoholic beer anyways the bed is uncomfortable and solid as a rock and the pillows is awful i wouldn t class it as a pillow in fact maybe half a pillow i wouldn t stay here again i feel as if i was shafted with the money i spend for just nights
