the hotel was very bad internet a couple of days did not work at all it was reported that there were technical lining it is very strange that in the hotel lobby in the restaurant there is no alcohol not even beer or wine on foot the center is far away this must be understood when ordering this hotel there is nowhere to go for a walk but actually in amsterdam there is a place to take a walk
