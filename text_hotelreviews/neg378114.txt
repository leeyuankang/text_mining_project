both my boyfriend and i thought that the breakfast prices was a bit ridiculous the food in the hotel overall was quite expensive and is not all that great at all we ate out almost every day although there were not many restaurants around either unless you travelled into the centre which is not always ideal i did not like how the hotel doesn t accept cash and in our case they did not accept our debit cards either as they only accept credit cards the facilities in the room were very mediocre the hairdryer was not powerful and when we attempted to iron our clothes the iron was leaking lots of water and the ironing board was broken we did however notify the front desk and they supplied a new one
