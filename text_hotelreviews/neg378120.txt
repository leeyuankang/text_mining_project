there was no wifi for our night stay which was a disappointment as we had brought an ipad to watch movies in the evenings it also meant we couldn t check online for where to find the best of anything we used our amsterdam book instead although this wasn t ideal as it was old there is no restaurant or shops near the hotel so we had to take trams into the main city to eat although the hotel does offer dinner i am told that they used to offer a dinner buffet but this was not the case when we stayed at the end of may after the first night the room was cleaned but the coffee and tea was not replenished we ordered room service entrec te beef which was delicious and cheese pizzas which were not that great didnt seem fresh
