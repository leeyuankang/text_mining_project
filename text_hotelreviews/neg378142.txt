beds were hard and uncomfortable location wasn t the best as its next a main road and was quite noisy so didn t get much sleep it also required taxis to get into town as its a minute walk to amsterdam city centre although a tram does stop right outside the hotel my partner and i try to avoid public transport one huge downside was that due to a recent change in local licensing laws they could not serve any alcohol in the bar or the restaurant
