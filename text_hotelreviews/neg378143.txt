interior of room is a bit dated but comfortable bit of a mismatch as the bathroom looked remodeled and modern missed the coffee refill in the room at room make up and we missed it the next morning internet in our room was super slow but it was very quick in the computer room downstairs just inconvenient that we needed to take our laptop downstairs
