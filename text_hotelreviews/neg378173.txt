the golden tulip supplied disposable wash cloths for their guest in each room at first i thought it to be a sanitary option to the cloth ones unfortunately i soon found out that it wasn t i booked two rooms at for three nights and one night for a total package of paid in full at check in the second day the towels were replaced but not the disposable wash cloths i called down to the desk and asked to have wash cloths replaced the receptionist informed me that they are not replaceable i told her that i was not informed of the disposable wash cloth policy then there was an awkward pause and she asked if their was something else i hung up went in the hall and asked the cleaning staff for two wash cloths for myself and my husband why would they expect a guest to reuse disposable wash cloths i don t get it in addition almost all the furniture in the room was damaged even the coffe cup saucer was chipped the spring mattress was hard and flat what upscale hotels still uses old spring mattresses
