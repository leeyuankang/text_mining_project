the hotel restaurant was just ok for dinner we decided to go to casa a michael across the road instead and it was much better at less cost the menu was limited and didn t explain dishes fully a wine bar type of alternative with a wider range of more affordable food would suit families better so many guests are staying in the hotel that really you should have a buzzing atmospheric restaurant in the evenings and you don t it s quiet empty quite cold and without charm the staff are very nice and they are a great asset to the hotel
