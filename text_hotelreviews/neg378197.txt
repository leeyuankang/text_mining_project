the woman preparing pancakes was rushed by her supervisor in result she was forced to put a doughy not thoroughly cooked pancake on my plate she seemed to know but apparently had to listen when her boss motioned for her to give out the pancakes she gave me a guilty apologetic look as she told me it may not be done i would have rather waited a little longer for a proper pancake perhaps they should consider putting two cooks on to make pancakes if it is such a popular item
