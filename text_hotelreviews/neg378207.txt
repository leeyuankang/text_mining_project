there was smoke smell in the room my year old son showed me next day that there is a plastic cover on the ceiling the guest who stayed there before had covered the smoke detector with a plastic cover and smoked inside the room i don t blame the hotel for that but what i didn t really like was the attitude of some staff who threw the cover on my carpet that too not even in the dust bin after i informed about the plastic cover on ceiling when i informed this calling reception the staff was very cool about it and they said that housekeeping will clean it when they clean the room
