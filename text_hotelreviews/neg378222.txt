on the second day of our stay the coffee machine didn t work so we were unable to have a drink and room service only left us one towel which was disappointing the hairdryer provided was very sub standard and if you have shoulder length or longer hair i would recommend taking your own hairdryer or allowing extra time to dry your hair there was only one lift working throughout our stay overall i would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to amsterdam
