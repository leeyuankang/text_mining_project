the hotel currently has no licence to serve alcohol as i believe they forgot to renew i think you should make that very clear on your booking systems or remove it until they have regained their licence when i asked the barman if there was somewhere that we could get a beer locally he mentioned the local chinese restaurant and said they may let you sit at a table and have a drink without ordering food i wasn t sure if he was being sarcastic or unhelpful or didn t know if there were other local options on day two i took a walk around and found a great bar minutes from the hotel and they told me there were many others around and also good options in local westerpark very unsatisfactory and not very helpful on the part of the hotel i definitely wouldn t book it again
