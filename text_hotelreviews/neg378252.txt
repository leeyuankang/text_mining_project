overall a great hotel a couple of minor criticisms the breakfast is slightly overpriced but that being said it has a wide variety of choice and tastes great we noticed that someone had crudely drawn a massive penis in biro in the elevator we found this highly amusing but the old lady who joined us in the elevator wasn t too impressed i think more attention to the elevator cleanliness as there was also litter on the floor and grubby mirrors
