there was a problem with the windows loads of water was getting in the window sill was covered in puddles of water we informed the reception which offered us to move rooms or they could clean it up we choose to stay where we were and we would be out all day so if they could clean it it would be great by the time we got back to the hotel it wasn t done again the next day we just asked for some extra towels to be put in the room for us to clean it up ourselves but again this was not done the water was dripping onto the floor we were told this was a problem in a lot of the rooms as a hotel we did not expect a leaky window really let the atmosphere of the hotel down
