the staff the receptionist where ever so rude not helpful at all first problem we had was waking up to a horrible stench coming from the bathroom there was a drain problem so we had to be moved to another room was easily sorted so thought everything would be okay for the remainder of the trip well i was wrong my whole outfit from the first day had been left in the bathroom of the room they had originally gave us i was completely shocked to get to reception and the lack of care and help was unbelievable they wasn t bothered in the slightest and i almost felt like i was being a problem by complaining apparently my clothes were nowhere to be seen and had grown legs and walked off by themselves so we left the hotel with none of the missing belongings no apologies no reply or response from the manager absolutely appalling customer service completely ruined our experience here oh and this was our second stay and now our last at the golden tulip because we loved the style of the hotel and the food was amazing what a shame to be completely let down by the staff
