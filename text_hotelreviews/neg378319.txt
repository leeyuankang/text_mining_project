the additional cost for breakfast was quite high about pp so we did not have breakfast at the hotel furthermore the location of the hotel is quite far off the city centre however there is a tram line no directly next to the hotel which goes to museumsplein with the famous van gogh and rijksmuseum etc from there it s just a few minutes walking or cycling to the city centre all in all except for the pricy breakfast we had nothing to complain
