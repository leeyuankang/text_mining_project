the location was poor we knew it was a train stop out of town but problem was there was absolutely nothing else in the vicinity this wouldn t have been so bad if the hotel had facilities but we weren t advised until we checked it that they didn t even have a bar licence so sold no alcoholic beverages at all and there was nowhere local to buy them despite the location details stating it was only from the central station this is a bit misleading because despite this proximity it takes a good to get into town by whichever mode of transport tram or train once you take the stops changes walks and waits between trains into account we arrived around to be told our rooms weren t ready but would hopefully be ready for us by this was reasonable enough given our early arrival time given the distance into town and back we opted to wait in the bar area without a drink but had to re apporach reception at when they hadn t come back to us they advised us one room was now ready but the second hadn t been started on yet and wouldn t be ready until after we opted to all change in the one available room of us so we could head into town for the new years eve celebrations the only other gripe was at point of booking we were given the option to choose bed configuration this gave rise to the expectation they could meet this but they couldn t the request for a quad room our teenage children was met but the double bed request for my husband and i was not we had twin beds given the two rooms had cost us just over euros for one night all in all it was a bit disappointing
