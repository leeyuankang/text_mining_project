we made a booking months before going away when i hadn t received a confirmation email i rang to see if we had definatly confirmed a room i was told i hadn t so i made a quick booking online when i arrived they informed me that i had made bookings for people when infact i wanted booking for of us i was made to pay for the most expensive room which was euros when originally my first booking was only euros i was told there was nothing i could do about it and it was my fault poor service poor attitude
