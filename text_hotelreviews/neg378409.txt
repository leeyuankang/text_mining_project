they have mini vending machine inside room which was out of function due to some software problem alternatively they suggested to come down to bar for ice or beverages by which am so addict to so i had to go down most of my stay but i won t consider it as bad matter as they gave ice for free there were no fridge or mini bar included in room description some how they made it up for this matter by offering the ice beverage from ground floor bar
