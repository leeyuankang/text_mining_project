the staff with the notable exception of anna who worked in the bar and was lovely and another member of the catering staff whose name i don t know the reception desk staff were generally polite enough when they were actually dealing with you but they managed to make you feel invisible while you were waiting you never knew whether or not they had seen you and they often continued to talk among themselves one even continued to arrange piles of envelopes as we stood waiting at the desk the bed sheets weren t changed as often as was indicated in the hotel literature clean sheets were simply left piled on a bedroom chair and in the end we had to leave a note asking that they be changed also the room could have been better dusted especially the window sill and the bathroom
