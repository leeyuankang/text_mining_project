the mini bar machines in the rooms they are vending machines and no fridges the drinks are not cold and are out of date tip dont get cold drinks sodas from the bar or machines for a bottle go down to the car park use the vending machine for the same price get a bottle also the resturant is only a bjffett style for felt the place was a little expensive but nice if you want something special
