all first of all the location is far away from the center buses for arriving in downtown with minutes of waiting in between therefore you need one hour to get to down town or back to the hotel therefore often we had to use taxi especially in the evening regarding the staff only one boy with glasses was nice and useful he suggested me to buy the bus card all the other ladies were awful unpleasant gross and completely useless pillows were huge and we couldn t sleep properly i had to sleep without any pillow because of course at the reception said there were no other type the phone between rooms was not working and they never fix it we were traveling with my old father and i had to go up and down several times every day in order to share info or going out in at the same time we asked to change room in order to be at the same floor and of course it was not possible even if we offer to pay the difference the breakfast in general the quality is not too bad but the cleaning is very bad they put fruits on different shelf the first morning one apple fell into the yogurt bowl and the guy put is hand without any gloves inside the yogurt bowl in order to remove the apple i couldn t believe to my eyes few minutes before he was removing dirty dishes from the tables a russian lady with long hair were touching bread with her hair i told it to the guy and nothing happen
