we had a room reservation one of the rooms was very small and requested for that room to be changed the staff went out of their way not to accomodate us on a different room first they claimed not to have a room available then that they did but had to wait hours to be changed but we had to leave the room immediately finally they wanted to charge euros because the coffe machine had been used manager janine zooties stated that she did not care about me complaining because all complaints went to her she refused to give me her last name and said that it was a very difficult name i would not recommend this hotel i do travel a lot and would not return to this hotel
