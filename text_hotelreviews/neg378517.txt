during the check in the receptionist saw that i was with my girlfriend she didn t have the perception and or consideration to ask if we preffered a double bedroom or even offer a bigger bedroom if i paid more she just gave me the keys and smiled professionaly when i arrived at my room i was very disappointed because she put us in a room with two single beds very strange for a stars hotel not asking the guest what is best for him i tried to ask if it was possible to change the room but the receptionists were rude and said that today they couldn t do anything only tomorrow i felt that they didn t care about my complain and didn t want to solve my problem in order to not screwing my special holiday with my girlfriend it was brazilian valentine s day june i decided to stay in the room and create no problem the wifi connection was horrible the signal was very low and the support was not helpful for an alleged stars hotel it is a shame not to provide a stable and fast wifi connection to all guests airports who has thousands of people everyday do it smoothly and efficiently capital expenditures must be directed to it infrastructure in order to solve this i was mad because i couldn t contact my familly neither watch my favorite videos channels on youtube tv channels were not enough the towels were dirty they had a strong smell grotty we had to dry ourselves with the face towel i was affraid to call the receptionist and be charged by asking a new towel no open frigobar was available no microwave was available it is not nice to be obliged to eat in the hotel restaurant as a stars hotel you should at least dispose a common place for people to heat their meals how do people with special diets do how mothers can heat their baby food the beverage machine available was broke i couldn t even buy a bottle of water
