the hotel s location was awful contrary to advertised the hotel is not close at all to the city centre and you have to take two trams and at least minutes to get there there is no urban life around the hotel no shops no pharmacies no caf s no grocery stores no bakeries no nothing the hotel s breakfast is too crowded and well below the level one would expect from a presumed star hotel simply tasteless food straight from the supermarket box to finalize the hotel was way too expensive for what it offers better go for an airport hotel and take the train everyday to the city
