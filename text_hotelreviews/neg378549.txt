it would have been nice if they have a wellness area at the hotel where one could enjoy a relaxing massage etc after a long day of sight seeing an indoor pool would also be perfect too just another tiny recommendation it would really be nice to keep the hotel s reputation if the public toilets be kept clean all the time though this is really hard i guess and the hallways be vacuumed regularly too i guess this is also a bit challenging on the hotel s part for it means hiring more housekeeping staffs
