we only stayed for three days at the golden tulip and we didn t try the breakfast nor the dinner because we wanted to explore other restaurants and cafes in amsterdam although i m i m pretty sure they were pretty high standard and good value so the only thing we didn t like was that we couldn t find many other good restaurants in the neighborhood so you will have to head down closer to city center to find some but then there s plenty downtown too so if you want to dine and eat breakfast close by i d recommend eating at the hotel
