there is no concierge in the hotel so everyone must wait in a long very slow moving line to ask simple questions some of the staff were rude not willing to give directions tourist information rude staff the older barman was rude ignored our repeated requests at the bar for our bill i e afternoon snack he just walked away from us when we asked a third time also one staff member on the front responded to a query about cost of parking nothing is free in this world only the sunrise we asked for an extra bed were given a larger room instead at an additional cost but no help to move rooms we had pack up and bring our luggage to reception before we left on our tour that evening we had to collect our bags and find our own way to the room plus the key didn t work so we d another trip to reception and waited in line again
