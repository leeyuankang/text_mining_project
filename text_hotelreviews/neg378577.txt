i wouldn t go as far as to say i didn t like it but thought it would be better if there was some light snack type meals served beyond similar to that served up until you could buy a slice of pizza fries and a couple of other things but not huge choice and sometimes if travelling with kids it would be handy to be honest though more often than not we would be in the city centre at that time of the day and not use this but others with younger children might the night we were going to the airport it would have been good though
