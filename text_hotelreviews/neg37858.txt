worst ever waldorf facing main street very noisy all the time first night we had a double bed on the second floor noises by the cars can be heard everywhere bathroom is a mass the spray is the most fantastic one i have ever seen it can make the whole bathroom wet and without another one to take shower together u cannot successfully finish washing your hair isn t it romantic the next day they agreed to change us to another room and the mirror on the wall of the bathroom nearly fell down thriller movies plenty of stars hotels around much more cozy than this
