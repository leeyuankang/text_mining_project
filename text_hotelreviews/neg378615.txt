i hated that there was a vending machine instead of a fridge in the room i cannot get over the non smoking hotel concept i mean at least a room or for smokers i paid gd money to relax n that includes me smoking a cigarette in my room if i choose and not to get dressed n go down to do so moreover on top of all of that i was charged for every day i parked my car in the hotel which is ridiculous and redundant where hotels usually provide a valet parking service let alone a free parking with the room
