only slight downside is that the location is not central it s probably too far to walk if you have bags but not impossible there is a tram stop outside the hotel number takes you to the center in about minutes or you can change to for different areas around the city we didn t find the distance a problem and we were happy to get the team which runs til each night after this there is a night bus every hour from the central station
