we arrived in the bar at and really wanted to order some food after a long day out the lunch menu finished at which i thought was extremely early there was food available at only small food slices of pizza fries etc i approached the bar at to ask about the food that was available the woman behind the bar repeatedly said that there was no food until before walking off i found her extremely rude as i only wanted to ask her about the types of pizza available i also wanted to order some drinks i also thought it was a bit silly to not take our order for the sake of minutes when i went back to the bar to ask about the pizza and order the woman repeatedly kept trying to walk away before i was finished talking i asked her what pizza was available and she said either plain or meat i ordered one of each however when the pizza arrived both were covered in vegetables and not what we ordered despite her saying there was only two types available i found the bar lady extremely rude and unaccommodating especially since there was only two other people in the bar its not as if she was too busy i also found it very strange that food stops at and the only food available is small food at this was annoying as there did not seem to be anywhere close by to get food other than a chinese which was closed
