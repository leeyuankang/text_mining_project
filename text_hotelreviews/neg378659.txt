because i m a vegan i only ate at the hotel s dining room once the buffet is quite extensive with many many options unless you re a vegan it s also pretty pricey especially if the only thing you can eat from it is the bok choy and broccoli thankfully amsterdam is pretty vegan friendly though so i didn t go hungry it would be nice if the hotel would offer more plant based options though
