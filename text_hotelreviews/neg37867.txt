this hotel room is billed as a a night accommodation and it did not meet that level of standard we paid half that amount through bookings com so for what we paid the room was ok but we had better value at another paris hotel the room was small but our biggest concern was the shower the tiles on the boarding the rubberized shower portion are very slippery
