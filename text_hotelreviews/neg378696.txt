one request we made the only request was a thin soft pillow a hotel that claims to be rated that can not facilitate this request indeed not even warn us in advance that you stock just one deep pillow will not score highly our comfort was taken away by golden tulip not facilitating this specific request it was disappointing not to receive a response before our arrival
