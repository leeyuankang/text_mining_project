we did not like how the reception office works we had to wait a lot for the receptionists response the answers to our questions were not satisfactory for example we asked to recommend us nearby post office from where we can send a parsel and did not get clear answer where to go when we checked out in the morning we asked for the invoice for car parking for which we already paid in advance for the whole stay and receptionist told us that he can t print the invoice without parking ticket it was in the car downstairs and we gad to go there we asked for the invoice for the breakfast for which we already paid and did not get the receipt and the receptionist asked us to wait when the restaurant will open we just wondering why to complicate simple things and to ask clients to do a lot of additional movements while checkung out
