when we arrived with our friends we were told that their room had been cancelled the week before because when the hotel tried their visa card just a week before it said it had expired they sent a message to booking com who in turn e mailed me to say that the card had expired we were away from home travelling in europe and didn t had sporadic wifi for two weeks so i wasn t bothering to check e mails on checking when we arrived at our hotel i found out that the message was only sent to us in this regard just a week or so previously and we did not get it it was very inconvenient to arrive without a room this room had been confirmed six months previously with a card that had not expired the hotel was totally booked and there wasn t a room for our friends gary and josephine dawe they had to stay in our room and we had to pay an extra for having the only room available with two extra beds we had to go through the inconvenience and disadvantage of having to double up the next day our friends had to move again to a room that became available they used the same visa card they had given in the very beginning
