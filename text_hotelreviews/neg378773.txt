the aircon in my room was not working and it was really hot told staff who were reluctant to do anything immediate however they called a specialist the next day but then i had a rough nite due to the airco not working and on the second day they changed my room as it turned out the aircon in the other room had a major fault my only gripe was that after all my effort to explain to staff that the aircondition was not working and that the room was very hot the staff on call took it with a pinch of salt and advised that it would work only after some minutes but i already explained it was on for over an hour and still not working next day they gave me free breakfast for the inconvenience i still think the staff should be more responsive to guests requests especially when there is something wrong in the room
