dinner and breakfast ridiculously over priced it s about a mum journey over trams to get into dam square so if you were wanting a night in the hotel you were asked to pay each for a buffet yeah the food was good but there s only do much you can eat also the beds we had were horrible singles pushed together with horrible yellow mattress bed could have been more comfortable
