during a one night stay i had to contact with different ladies at the front desk this does not apply to all but the youngest lady that i asked how to go into town by tram almost scolded me by saying that it was written in the map they had given us while checking in she was complaining that no one was reading the map and kept asking them to be honest the map they gave was a print out and i had a colourful one so i did not pay attention to that map it is her job to explain and she explained so what is the point in being rude meanwhile you have to take two trams to the central station where you can get a canal tour and transfer time between the two trams can be long it took us minutes just to return to the hotel last point is the parking garage it is fine and well organized well lit but after paying for the parking ticket by credit card at the machine do not lose more than minutes as we are on holiday it took us some time maybe minutes to get ready to go on the road and the gate did not open and charged us another euros so we had to go back and pay that amount
