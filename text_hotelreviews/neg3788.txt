no gym as its being refurbed which was not clear on the site apart from right at the bottom also i was not allowed to then change hotel after i discovered this when i brought it up with the staff in the morning who were a little short i was then emailed far to late saying i could change but by that time i was already at work also you changed the price of the booking the second night to add insult because of demand which apparently was on the site too absolute joke how you can get away with that
