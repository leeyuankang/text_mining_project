what a difference since my previous stay in the summer my room was like a shoebox the wardrobe was taken up by the hotel s bathrobe which when i transferred it to the bathroom meant i had to go into it sideways room was so small when you used the loo you knocked the loo roll off its holder most of the mini bar was placed on the bedside cabinet i had to place my small case on the desk chair and left a lot in it as i couldn t find a drawer immediately complained but told nothing could be done that day as the hotel was full i was told i could move on the following day which i declined due to time constraints in fact i was so upset by everything i booked an early flight home the same day which cost me over a they still charged me for the second night which i didn t think was the best public relations move as i certainly would not use this hotel again and would not recommend it to anyone else a big thank you to the hotel manager who was too busy with a meeting at the other end of the reception to speak to me personally
