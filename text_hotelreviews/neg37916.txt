the staff wasn t very helpful first when we checked in they didn t tell us about breakfast so we assumed there was no breakfast it was only in the morning while i was going out around that i noticed the breakfast room second we had asked for a late check in exception because we had to get ready for a wedding but when we came back to our room after noon to start getting ready our card didn t work and we had to explain to the receptionist that we had a late check in besides the cleaning lady came an knocked at our door again at even after we confirmed the late check in with the reception we d hope that for such a hotel it would be better handled and less stressful for clients
