i was chocked to see that the receptionist noted down my full credit card number and expiry date on my check in form this is not only an noncompliance to most cc companies security measures but also very risky as people with access to this information can do fraudulent transactions on my credit card to omit this risk most other hotels use the possibility to block an amount on your card which is much saver for the hotel and the hotel guest
