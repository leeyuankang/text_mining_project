the pool photos are a lie the fumes from the boats when they park next to the hotel caused my husbands asthma to trigger horrendous the pool bar service and food were poor at best the bowl of chips served contains about quarter of a basket of dry chips very very poor value if we hadn t had to pay on arrival we would have moved hotels this is a hotel for short stays when the boats come in forget it for anything else dinner is non existent the bar has no atmosphere and the upstairs bar was shut for of the nights we were there for private functions so dont call it a bar its a function space
