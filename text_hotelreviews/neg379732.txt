check in is pathetic this is the th time we have used this hotel because of its location and the check in experience just gets worse this time we arrived at and finally got our room at the safe didnt work reception said they would be up to sort it in minutes and minutes later they still hadnt arrived another phone call to get some response the pool area is very tired all the flagstones on the floor move very dangerous the shower head put water everywhere except over you and anything you used in the room like water milk or coffee was not replaced the next day certainly not star standards
