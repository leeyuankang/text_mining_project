we arrived on a early flight when asked at time of booking it was noted that if we could require a room before unfortunately there was no room available though they did offer us to keep our cases and we could freshen up there was a bit of mix up as when it got to they were still saying a room wasn t available unless we excepted single beds or if we could wait another hour to which i complained then a room was made available
