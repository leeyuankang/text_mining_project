the prices throughout the hotel bars etc were extortionate we only had one drink in the bar and a couple of juices by the pool because of the price the pool was much smaller than we expected however we did not use it so cannot comment further we booked room only as the charge per person per day for breakfast was high at euros we had tea coffee facilities in the room and bought pastries in the supermarket for breakfast
