we booked a family suite that was almost double our friends rooms that they booked it was just two rooms with adjoining front area we were put on the second floor with no view and our friends were put on the seventh floor with a beautiful view small pool i would ve expected a much bigger but beautiful views and great bartenders food selection in the eating areas needs to be more kid friendly the room service menu was more family friendly than the restaurants we ended up eating food in the room
