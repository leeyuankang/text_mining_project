my only complaint with the hotel was the food it was very expensive and not the best we had tapas in the floor bar they were awful we also had room service and the portions were tiny for a caesar salad and it was the tiniest size i have ever seen much smaller than a starter size i found this salad quite offensive i would come back to the hotel but i would worry about the food i would not eat in the hotel but i always need breakfast in the hotel so this would put me off returning we had room service breakfast and ate in the hotel for breakfast both poor in the restaurant slightly better and very overpriced
