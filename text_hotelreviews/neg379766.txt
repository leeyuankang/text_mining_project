unfortunately the day we were checking out there was a taxi strike in barcelona we ended up almost missing our flight trying to figure out how to best get to the airport it surprised me that the hotel did not notify us of this when we were checking out that morning i also found that for a star hotel there was not a lot of star qualities on one day i asked for our room to be cleaned and they must have forgotten on that day i had to ask again when we got back to the hotel late that night as they had also forgotten to do turndown service they also ran out of green tea and a pillow i was after these things are minor but for a star i would expect more
