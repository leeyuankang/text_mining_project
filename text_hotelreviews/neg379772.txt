i ve booked the premier room with balcony with extra large double bed being convinced tricked by the pictures that a stars hotel on the sea coast in barcelona can only have great views for a premier room we got to the hotel at first strange thing instead of scanning my credit card they ve made me pay the whole stay in advance hotel policy they said ok i ve paid then asked for the card to go upstairs but surprise there s not room yet the hotel was too busy the night before so they re still cleaning the room for us not great but ok we have to wait at least one hour they ask our phone number to call us when the room is ready in the meantime they offer us a card to get any complementary drink we d like from the hotel bar we get to the bar and ask for an aperol and a beer surprise again they can only offer us beer and wine as complementary drinks finally the bar tender is offering us a small aperol hm stars you say ok an hour and a half passes and we get no call so we show ourselves to the front desk surprise again the room is ready since half hour but nobody bothered to tell us we go upstairs and there comes the nastiest suprise the room faces the court yard which is surrounded by the conference center so we re looking at walls the bed is not double but a twin and not that we cared about the room size the view was what we wanted but the room is nowhere near the more like this time we re angry we return to the front desk and we calmly although we shouldn t be calm anymore express our dissatisfaction the first thing the manager tries is to trick me she claims that is a premier room and of course she claims that the misleading pictures presented on booking com are not firm offer now i m angry
