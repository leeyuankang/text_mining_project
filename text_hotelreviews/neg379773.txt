the hotel is located far away from everything at least minutes to decent restaurants and minutes from night life and is horrendously overpriced for what is provided i travelled in mid season mid week and paid euros i had problems in eurostars at valencia too i would not reccomend this eurostars chain at all the barcelona eurostars hotel was okay but for a high priced star hotel there were scratches on the floor lights that didn t work properly and general inattentiveness from staff after check in the pool is very tiny and the sauna is located in the bathroom in the gym a cleaner walked into the room even though we were checking out in minutes at which demonstrated to be disorganisation the hotel is generally far from everything and the roof bar closes at the roof bar was one of the main reasons i picked the hotel as they advertise a ambient rooftop bar but there is no ambience at all and staff were not polite on the rooftop bar when i was asking some questions about the area there was one nice staff member who let me take some photos at midnight whilst he cleaned the gym i would have been quite upset if i didn t get these photos also there is no security whatsoever the lifts are not locked and the hotel is accessible from the outside perimetre i noticed at night there was teens hanging around that clearly shouldn t have been near the facility save your money do not stay here
