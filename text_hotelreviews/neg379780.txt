it s a typical mass production hotel i booked for nights but i left only after night to stay in another star hotel however i had to pay nights due to booking com cancellation policy and i wouldn t mind doing that i stayed in many stars hotels in my life and that can t be one of them starting from the entrance of the hotel is very dull and creepy the room is big that s true and it has a view from the floor which is a very limited over the sea which was blocked by a big vessel that block almost the whole view the commiseration with the reservation team in the hotel was a disaster i had to text them and call them couple of times to assure my stay would be comfortable before booking they promised my an upgrade to a superior room in the floor and they did so but really the room wasn t clean i saw stains on the glass of the window that can t clean and the bath tub has some black residual stains and i had to clean them hard before getting in the shower has residuals hair from the previous guest the tv wasn t facing the bed so i had to wist my body all the time it wasn t comfortable at all the room wasn t sound proof at all as i was hearing the guest next room turning on very loud music when i informed the hotel and complained they promised me another room in the floor that is smaller but has a better view to the city i appreciated that from their side but i thought if i had to pack i d rather leave to another hotel with a better location the location of the hotel is quite bad as i had to walk minutes to get to the rambla streat i didn t try the swimming pool neither the breakfast so i can t comment about that i appreciate though some efforts of some individuals in the hotel that tried to make my stay more comfortable
