the hotel and furnishings are very worn and damaged andreally need an upgrade the bed was really saggy and you could see the indentation of each side where people have been sleeping it smelt very musty and the basin drains were plugged when i arrived in the room i unplugged them to wash my hands and when i returned a few hours later the whole room smelt like dirty drains also when i turned on the light in the night there were silverfish moths everywhere and i hope none are now in my suitcase eating my clothes i would stay elsewhere
