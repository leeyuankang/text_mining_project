i booked for adults and children but when i checked in they refused to give me the room with the price i booked because they said i should booked a bigger room even though i mentioned that we are adults and kids they asked me to pay double the price for a bigger room however i told them that booking com accepted my booking they said i should solve this problem with booking and they would help me if i booked my room directly from the hotle s website because of that my trip s budget became less because the extra money i paid for the room and my family didn t enjoy the trip because of that worth to mention that when they forced me to take a bigger room suit they said it is only for persons and i should book another room for my kids i tried with them for some time then they allowed us to stay together in the same room
