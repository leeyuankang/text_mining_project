main first floor lobby area being renovated meant that the hotel didn t have much to offer in terms of hotel lobby features the qube lobby bar restaurant outside of floor was ok but disconnected and not well used while in a good location hotel is out of the main city centre where the tourist places are so it was always a long walk or taxi ride to go to the gothic quarter or anywhere worth visiting being a little out of the central area it gives you nice views of the city from over the marina so overall good but not great
