right next to the hotel there is a moring place for ferries which are quite noisy continuous low staccato drone of heavy engine often for many hours even during the night there does not appear to be any significant sound proofing of the rooms against this problem which is not acceptable for a star hotel for me this is already enough reason not to return to this hotel the bed in the room is quite soft and not flat there was a pronounced dimple on one side showing that the mattrass had exceeded it s functional life time and should have been replaced already
