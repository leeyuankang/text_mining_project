not good reception services no lounge restaurant not really inviting not very efficient in the timing of room cleaning often in the late afternoon roooms where not cleaned disappointing the lack of flexibility for late check out in the afternoon unless paying the entire rate of course not a stars in our view price not worth the quality and not client oriented would not return for sure it is more a business place for people staying few nights
