the hotel s hot tub was out of order which was not mentioned and a bit misleading the pool is a lot smaller than pictured and had a large chunk of wood broken off one side with nails exposed long wait for checking in despite many staff also the hallways reek of smoke that spills into the room even after requesting a non smoking facility the location is a bit out of the way not very near many attractions absolutely worst paella ever at hotel restaurant and extremely slow service
