i really didn t like this hotel which ironically was the most expensive one we got relocated here so didn t choose it specifically it is a business hotel and not for leisure the dark wood is quite depressing and the rooms are a nice size but dark and not very welcoming it wasn t in the marina and the roof terrace was not very inviting also its not good if you feel claustrophobic
