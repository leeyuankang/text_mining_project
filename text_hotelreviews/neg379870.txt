the bed was too soft there were no boxes of tissues very unbecoming of stars hotel the location is a very long walk to the super market or restaurants the hotel was not generous in giving laundry bags tooth brushes and paste our request for early check in was totally ignored till i had to insist on checking in as stipulatated because they could not get room ready even after my internet request stated clearly we had travelled hours flight and were tired i was sick after this hours flight and despite my request this hotel just cannot make room earlier quite ridiculous
