rooftop pool is only a dipping pool photos make it look much bigger the paving slabs on the rooftop are all very loose so you have to be careful when walking particularly older people very easy to trip up do not get booked into room you will be able to swim around the bathroom it s an old shower that sprays water everywhere quite dangerous on a marble floor when you have to step in and out of a bathtub deluxe rooms with single beds have separate shower area much better tea coffee doesn t get replaced after the first day if you ve used it food and drink is very expensive
