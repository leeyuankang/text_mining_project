this hotel claims a star rating in my opinion it is not rooftop terrace was dissapointing with broken flooring and broken loungers around the pool area wifi on the rooftop terrace also very poor staffing levels were also inadequate around the pool and bar area during the day time i would not recommend this property to another traveller stay in the city centre as the location is not great in my opinion
