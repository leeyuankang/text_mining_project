no continental breakfast only facial tissues in a packet in the baths very irritating cheap toilet paper service fee for ice delivered to room location is dicey having to use the roundabout entrance at the wtc this roundabout and the lights are very difficult to figure out and the roundabout is dangerous to negotiate we got stopped by police for running a red light to the hotel entrance at the wtc because the light was so high up over our car and on the side of the road that we didn t even know it was there driving in barcelona is pretty awful anyway so the hotel could make it easier to get to the hotel with much better directions
