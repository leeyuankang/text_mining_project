the pool area was smaller than we expected but this didn t spoil our trip whilst the room was lovely it was not actually the room we booked and having waited until we were then told it was still not ready and offered the alternative which we took by then we were exhausted from travelling so decided to take what was offered however it really was a lovely room just not what we booked
