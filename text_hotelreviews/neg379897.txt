no exceptions to any early check in before pm we had to wait from a m off boarded from cruise ship until pm before they would issue a room claimed no rooms available must be issues with their house cleaning staff and no hospitality to cruise clientele many guests were treated this way which is unfortunate especially for the price they charge restaurant services limited and not friendly all of this occurred with our first stay before the cruise as well so this seems to be consistent level of service they were actually minutes late in getting us a room upon check in this was frustrating since we travel a lot and this is not the norm for most hotels
