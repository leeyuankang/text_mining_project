seemed under managed staff were not very invested in making customers happy they seemed confused and unhappy most of the time priced as a business hotel it gets some of the basics wrong for example it took minutes to get a cup of coffee at breakfast both days rooms are well designed but have significant maintenance issues knobs missing etc so it feels like new build even when it isn t i think there is a need for improved management not least at the front desk and in the restaurant barcelona has a lot of options and this place isn t earning its money oh and the pool is really a large bathtub so don t believe the pictures on the website definately not a venue for a family vacation also considerable evidence of how to say it hooking up of a professional nature basically this hotel would be a better fit in eastern europe than one of the world s greatest cities
