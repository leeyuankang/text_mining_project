bedroom was dusty had a balcony but no seats to sit out on it very pricey drinks gym entrance doors left open so it was far to warm to work out properly as air con will only work properly when doors windows closed pancakes pree cooked for breakfast left to dry up under a warming lamp awful so glad we didn t have one of the rooms at the back of the hotel as they overlook a large office block with no other views
