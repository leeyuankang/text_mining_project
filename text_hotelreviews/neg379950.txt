at almost a night there was no breakfast included in that price nor was parking included it s really hard to give hotels top notch ratings when they refuse to even include the basics the pool was a slightly oversized hot tub actually in sweden we ve enjoyed a hot tub larger than their pool there is an adorable boutique hotel in the middle of the city that has a way nicer pool but a rooftop that isn t even the size of this place wish we were still there it starts with an o if you re interested and serves some of the best tapas in town cocktails here started at we went to some really nice restaurants and their cocktails weren t even that price so i m not sure what you re paying for because it certainly wasn t the ambiance other patrons were of questionable character there were american frat boys old russian men with child brides or escorts and a guy with gang terrorist themed tattoos all over his body multiple locations in the building guests were extremely loud and up until one night and another group was up until the next night keep in mind we were here during the middle of the week somewhere else people were smoking pot which filled our room with the smell needless to say we didn t get much rest our room was never made up until well after we would go out all day come back for a break or to use the pool and without fail they would knock on our door sometime between to clean our room so we would leave again to accommodate their late cleaning schedule plus when you take a shower the water gets all over the bathroom floor and make sure your curtains are closed if you have a courtyard side room or all the office workers in the building that make up the open square will get quite the show better off sticking with the travelodge or ilk if you re going to stay at a chain hotel
