the swimming pool was really small only for a dip not for swimming not enough of deck chair on the roof we didn t manage to get any deck chair to rest and enjoy the view for our entire stay i personally feel that the security at this hotel is too loose anyone can just walk in and out the hotel and enjoy the facilities no scanning of room card required for the use of lift to get to all level no staff at roof level s counter no identity required to use the facilities of the hotel feel unsafe and there is one early morning around someone knocked on the door without identifying themselves and i was too scared to open the door as not sure who is out there it can be anyone bathtub was not very clean with blackish discoloration hence i dare not to use at all
