this is a star hotel hiding under the heading of stars the staff from the minute we checked in were not very helpful at all despite reading on trip advisor that they were happy joyful and helpful at all times we were supposedly given an upgrade at check in but i doubt very much that we were at breakfast time on the first morning the waiteress took my plate before even finishing my food then the subsequent days the waiters had to be asked to clear the plates when we ordered drinks in the bar they took forever to be served bathroom toiletries were none existent unless you asked reception for them to be supplied to say the place has a swimming pool what a joke it was more like the size of a kids paddling pool in conclusion i wouldn t recommend this hotel to anyone when you check into a star hotel you expect to get the star treatment this hotel falls well short of that
