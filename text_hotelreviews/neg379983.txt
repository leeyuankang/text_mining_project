we had requested a high floor room with ocean view but on arrival the hotel was near capacity and whilst we were offered an upgrade on floor we declined as was a smoking room the only room in our category left was on the floor which was close to a conference room being used in the day and we could slightly hear music drifting up from the bar so not exactly ideal service at times a little slow in the bar
