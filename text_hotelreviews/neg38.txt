the only thing that would of been better is if i had booked more nights but apart from that there is not really much i dislike about the hotel i suppose if there is one thing the room i had did not have a view only other rooms but i dont tend to go on holiday to sit in my hotel room staring out the window so not really a great deal i can find that i did not like plus stayed for nights and this place was perfect for that
