would not stay here again for a leisure trip the late discount seemed appealing but the star prices for everything reduced our usage of the facilities e g euros for a minibar coke ok if i was on a business trip and costs were covered that would be fine or ok for the very well off i suppose the tv had very limited english channels and you can only watch so much news i know that this opinion is subjective however i am reviewing on the basis of a leisure trip with an older child and they look for a lot of food and drink and tv i once asked if we could take drinks from the bar to the room and got a negative response suggesting that we should order from the room as there was a service charge so again not really an ideal environment if trying to relax on holiday very business orientated all that aside the only thing that was an actual fault was that the air conditioning could not be controlled in the room there was a control panel but it did not matter what i tried it did not adjust the a c i even switched it off and it did not affect anything a bit noisy draugthy and cold at night and too warm during the day i remember seeing a previous review mention this and i just thought it would be a unique problem when i tried to adjust it a lock key symbol started flashing so i can only assume the room a c is centrally controlled and that the control panels were for use at some point in the past
