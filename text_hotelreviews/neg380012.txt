poor service particularly in the bar had to ask times for a bottle of water one evening the staff seem to be rushing around and everything seemed uncoordinated offered a complimentary cocktail but after a meal and several drinks at the bar and restaurant they took the money off the cheaper glasses of cava we had not the cocktails waited ages for the food to arrive only offer complimentary bottles of water in the room on the first night really not impressed with our overall experience here and will not be returning
