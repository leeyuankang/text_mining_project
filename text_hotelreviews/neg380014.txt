the room was disappointing for the price lights weren t working in the bathroom so we showered in the dark rang reception to ask for them to be changed and i was on hold for over mins before the call was answered said they would be changed but this didn t happen the jacuzzi bath didn t work and there was no shower curtain so the bathroom would be soaked in mins luckily house keeping were good and came up and mopped the floor after every shower nb just ask reception on your way out don t bother phoning all the facilities gym etc were closed over the weekend we stayed and there was no advance warning very disappointing
