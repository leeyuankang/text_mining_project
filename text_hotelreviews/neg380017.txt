it is a decent star big size hotel but it has nothing special the staff is ok but does not connect with you there are too many guests and everything is rather un personal the foyer and the bar leave a cold impression the breakfast in the morning is a disaster food is good but you have to first stand to mins in the queue before you get a table as they simply don t have the space for all their guests this is a luxury hotel without a soul and you don t feel special good enough for business but not for leisure we did not like it
