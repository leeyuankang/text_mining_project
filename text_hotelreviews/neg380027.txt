the only slight concern is that whilst the hotel has a lovely setting and almost idyllic location it is about minutes stroll to las ramblas and about mins to the gothic quarter and el born just something to consider if you re not able to walk too far not a problem for us though and of course you can use the metro and there s also a taxi line outside
