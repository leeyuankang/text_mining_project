food poisoning hotel management i was made sick from the breakfast buffet by bad smoked salmon three hours later i was vomiting non stop timers and had very bad diarrhea for three hours a doctor was called to our room and gave me two injections one for naseau and confimed if i was ok in hours it was food poisioning that is what happened as hours i was fine again but i was then too weak to drive and the hotel at first refused our one night extended stay request and then charged us for the additional night we had to stay the general manager would not contact me after three requests and the on duty manager was evasive and rude and completely unhelpful or sympathetic food hygiene in this hotel is a big problem and should be avoided at all cost unless you want to spend hours violently sick in bed
