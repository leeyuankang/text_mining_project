i didn t like the bed was over used and not renewed the shower was rusty and doesn t match a high standard hotel there was no lotion or even beauty kit and when i requested for q tips cotton there was none the other disaster was at breakfast in the morning i have never been in a hotel where i have to stand in a que waiting to be seated and the worst yet to come with servants who where very occupied that they forgot to serve anything we request i won t forget a servant who took the cheese from my plate by his hand to clear the plate and put my partner s plate on it and this same servant got us the tea without spoons or plates for times i felt ashamed in front of my partner because i picked this hotel with confidence that it would be the perfect one since i ve been there couple of years ago and was impressed but not anymore
