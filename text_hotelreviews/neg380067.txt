i came with a friend who booked an ordinary room my self i booked a suite when we arrived the staff at the reception up graded my friends room to a suite and offered him free break fast and when i asked them they should do the same with me and upgrade my suite to a higher category they refused and even they charged me for the breakfast although it is me who convenced my friend to come to this hotel to finish the story i decided to go for a higher suite which is looking over the sea and the city and instead of giving me the non smoker suite they gave me a suite in smooking area and told me all similar suites are occupied and when i refused to take it then only they gave another suite non smoking and they said it was a mistake i felt really sorry i had selected this lousy hotel
