room are only at the front there is no real seaview non descript hotel tucked into the wtc very small swimming pool on roof top meters by meters but my biggest complaint is the absurd pricing for breakfast and for drinks totally insane to pay euros per person for breakfast drinks too fresh orange juice euro gin tonic euro if a hotel has to destinguiish itself by pouring drinks from a bottle at these prices manegement please take action this has nothing to do with being exclusive this is nuts
