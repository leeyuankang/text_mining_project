the family suite was not family friendly not connected on the inside as it was when we stayed there years ago the outer door to the suite would not lock the room was a bit worn breakfast was not included in the high price the pool was small and there was no hotel shuttle or transportation to the main attractions given that the hotel is a bit out of the way
