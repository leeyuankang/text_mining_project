very nice hotel but there is absolutely no reason to stay at this hotel it is just far enough away to be inconvenient it has zero pace or vibe we stayed a week at the w hotel very cool and two days in sitges great beach town and could not get back in the w upon our return would never stay here again yet it s very nice
