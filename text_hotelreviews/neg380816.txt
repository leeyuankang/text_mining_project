i would have liked someone constantly at the reception and not an empty desk all the time the room is spatious has a nice large bath tub and a large shower the toilet is separate from the bathroom when i think about a business hotel i would expect a full mini bar not an empty fridge like we had also a espresso machine and a water heater some tea or coffee capsules well all of this things were unfortunately missing as well as a bottle of water which is seen in the most hotels these days but not here the beds are really confortable maybe a too soft mattress and pillows for some we had a lovely breakfast everything was there and delicious
