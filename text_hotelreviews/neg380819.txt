this is not star hotel there was nothing in mini bar no possibility to make coffee in suit no extra mile for guests only basic things like shampoo and soap on pictures on booking it looked like very luxury suit but when you enter the door it was far behind stars not even one small carpet in the suit overall gave very cold impression
