it is a bit pricey we didn t have breakfast it costs eur person and there are not so many options in the area just one small cafe in front of the hotel which serves only coffee no food pastry available but this is not a huge issue we bought some groceries and kept it in the minibar it might be nice to have a kettle in the room to at least prepare some tea coffee the neighborhood is not really lively embassies and residential area so if you are searching for coffees restaurants and night life this might not be the best choice for you
