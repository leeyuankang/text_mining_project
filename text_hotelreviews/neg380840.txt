i staed in this hotel but i couldn t open the window for the days because the blind was broken i asked to fix it or change to the other room but the staff said just wait and there is no room anymore and they also reject to refund so i had to wait almost and finally the repairman came but just fix i couldn t touch the blind if i touch it broken again i m so afraid because this hotel is very clean and the mager s service was very good but they had to check the blind
