we booked a residence suit because we wanted to have a little kitchen in our room when we arrived we saw that there was no kitchen so we complained and they told us that they did not have residence rooms available and that they will fix it the next day i have the impression that if we don t say anything they would have charged us with the residence room price for an inferior category room the next day after we remained them about the room they upgraded us to a better one when we had to pay we told them that for the first night we should pay less as the room where we slept was an inferior one according to the staff we have to pay the same as we have been upgraded at the end we did pay the same but i do not agree with that as all we wanted was a room with a kitchen and we did not ask for the upgrade so if they do not have what we book they should provide us with something better without any extra cost and if we have to use an inferior category room because their mistake we should pay less for that night internet did not work very well the strongest wifi signal we got in our room did not work we called to tell them and they said that they knew and that they will call a technician in nights we stayed there they did not fix it we could use another wifi with a very little strength that it just worked in a little part of the room for the price we paid we expected a better service
