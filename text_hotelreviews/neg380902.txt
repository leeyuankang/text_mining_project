i found the boiling bottle had remaining tea inside door to toilet cannot be closed glass door to the balcony is actually not a door but an half open window shower water changes from warm to cold unexpectedly breakfast is far below star standard parking is extremely expensive unlike other hotels which usually offer free or much lower cost for parking though not very far to scenic spots it still needs a minutes walk to the nearest one over all i don t think it is worthy for such a high room rate
