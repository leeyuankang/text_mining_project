various problems with the rooms booked by our group not sure if the staff didn t know their jobs or didn t care this was not a language problem as we understood each other perfectly many faults were reported by our group lights not working broken tap shower held up with a cable tie nothing ever done about any of the problems and when reminded simply said yes we have a note of it took nearly half an hour to check out as the member of staff couldn t get my card to work in the handheld card reader there was no problem with my card just that she didn t seem to know how to operate the machine she became fed up placed the blame with me and asked me to pay by another means as she couldn t take payment eventually minutes later another member of staff finally pushed the correct buttons and hey ho it worked fine no apology kettle in the room but nowhere near an electrical socket so had to balance on the bedside cabinet nespresso pods provided nothing else but no nespresso machine no fault of the hotel but this is the financial commercial district of barcelona fine for business but not a leisure trip
