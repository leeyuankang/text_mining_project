booking classed this as a luxury hotel shame on you booking com this at best would be star when being graded on luxury only plastic plug to use between sink bath and bidet bath had holes which had been filled but the plug obviously didn t fit the anyway luxury having a laugh the facitilities are none felt more like a apartment without tea or coffee in the room will provide a kettle if you ask just take your own tea coffee etc location is a good walk or bus ride to the centre not for people who aren t able to or don t enjoy a good stroll this hotel would be better classing themselves as an mini apartments providing kettle toasters few cups etc in rooms
