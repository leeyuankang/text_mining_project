hotel staff very unfriendly room was not ready when promised reservation said for people and the room given initially was for room was on floor and the smell of tabbaco was horrible sheets where not clean pillows were like bricks horrible beds and sofa bed was very uncomfortable for the family location was ok and some nice restaurants nearby for family dinning as other reviews the pictures of the hotel in this website are not what in reality are noisy as some construction or remodeling on the hotel or nearby was during the day overall awful experience and do not recommend for the price of over euros for nights look elsewhere please
