although we had a kettle and coffee machine there were no tea bags or coffee capsules the mini bar had a half drunken bottle of water in it and was never replenished the decor was tired the staff were young and prone to making mistakes such as giving other people our key and room number while we were still in it had to chase a group of young man out of our room which seemed to amuse the reception staff no idea what the breakfast was like because we were never told where or what time so not likely to return there are many hotels in barcelona si no need to settle for incompetence
