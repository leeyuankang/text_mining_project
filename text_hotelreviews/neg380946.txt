the air conditioning was not working to point out though we did not notify the hotel until check out as we spent very little time in the hotel and the temperature was liveable sleeping with an open window does not work if you are a light sleeper as the street is noisy the overall cleaning was not up to the standard especially in the bathroom re bathroom we believe that the hotel has been is being renovated as the pictures were different from what we got breakfast was not great and the facilities again not very clean even if this may depend on how sensitive one is
