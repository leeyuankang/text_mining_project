i think the guest contact should be better we arrived after lunch and a member of staff told us that our room would be ready in we chose to wait and settle instead of leaving the luggage on the locker it ended up being of wait not with them letting us know or apologising just us constantly asking another event was that the internet was down we needed that to buy tickets and plan also no feedbacks just us chasing them for it we got a triple room and the air conditioning power wasn t enough for the space our room was facing the street it s a very busy noisy area at night which woke me up many times overall very average for a star hotel
