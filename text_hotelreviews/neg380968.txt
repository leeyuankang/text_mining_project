internet wasn t working which was quite a problem for us as we depend on it so much but it wasn t the fault of the hotel breakfast items ran out before we got there at around am extra fee for using the safe prefer to make it a deposit for return of key suggest that reception has a decent map of where the hotel is in relation to key sites and tourist bus services
