i ve stayed in this hotel many times over the years but not for years really disappointed this time dislikes missing hotel room equipment including kettle tv remote pen paper etc according to the hotel staff all apparently all taken by previous guests unfortunately none of the items was replaced by staff prior to my check in thank goodness the previous guests decided to leave the bed behind also annoying was that some facilities advertised on website were no longer provided by the hotel such as free tea coffee biscuits in lounge at certain times for meetings and socialising etc
