first off i have no idea how this hotel is stars it felt more i was extremely disappointed in my room as you can hear everything it sounded like i was sleeping outside because the windows and walls are poorly insulated for sound you can hear everyone checking in if you are in the s for rooms i could only sleep with my noise canceling headphones and music playing due to the terrible insulation if you get stuck with the s rooms you are doomed i kept hearing how there werent many rooms available so i avoided changing my rooms and going through more stress the traffic is loud and the staff can be aloof i asked for help with something and the girl at the front desk was cold and brushed me off i really should have changed hotels and regret booking catalonia barcelona hotel last minute
