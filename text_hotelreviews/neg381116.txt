the whole thing is a cheap business hotel the bed slid around on the floor at the slightest movement of your body so i had to push it back into position several times every night the shower glass doors were apart so the floor of the bathroom was swimming in water after every shower the wall paper was peeling the building itself is ugly ugy ugly the hotel faces a busy street so as soon as you open the windows the room will fill up with exhaust fumes sickening breakfast is expensive the staff at the reception was primitive and offensive
