the hotel is definitely not star i would suggest only stars at the most everything felt a little bit dirty room was next to door for pool access room at top of staircase so was very noisy could hear water running in other rooms so i knew each time someone has used the toilet bath would not drain had to use a knife to release the plug staff in breakfast room did not behave in a way that made you feel welcome their priority was getting things packed up by close of service time rather than creating a comfortable environment i checked out one day early as i was not thrilled with the hotel and i had to ask times if i could receive a partial refund times i was told the manager wasn t available this is somewhat understandable but as i couldn t be given a straight answer i was unable to book the next leg of my trip in the end i was given a refund for one night which was good i d rate the hotel out of i ve stayed in worse but if i went back to barcelona i would not stay here again
