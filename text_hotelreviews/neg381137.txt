no wi fi too far from the center too nosy impossible to open the windows and it s impossible not to open them because it s too stuffy if you need smth from the personal you need to wait for long time the worst is parking it s a space in the cellar where the only normal places are busy by stuff several places for guests don t have normal way out you will need to creep mm by mm to park in and park out because of the passage is too narrow to do it without any risk for your car
