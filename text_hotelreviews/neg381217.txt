we missed our shuttle to the airport from the hotel because we were late for minutes we were fine to the fact that the hotel driver had to leave us but the attitude of the staff towards us were definitely not nice the way they talk is annoying and rude maybe they weren t happy that we were a bit late but we were not even angry or complaining we just wanted extra help to get other means of transport to airport so minus point for service this time
