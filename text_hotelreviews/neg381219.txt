i have stayed in other mercures and the breakfast wasn t as varied the make your own coffee machine was in an awkward position and there was always a queue in previous hotels the staff bring you coffee pots to your table and this machine meant we didn t get to enjoy our meal together as one of us was in a queue for a good portion of the meal for a hot drink they need to refill food a little quicker as the fruit salad was mainly grapes and a little disappointing
