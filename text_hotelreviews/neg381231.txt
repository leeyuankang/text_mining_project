there was an annoying display touch panel that you had to press for room cleaning and do not disturb which glowed really bright when you turned the lights out to sleep we stuck a couple of plasters over it to dim it lol ask for a higher floor if possible we were on and it wasn t that private unless blinds down and curtains drawn
