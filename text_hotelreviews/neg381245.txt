the first team of receptionists when we first got there our rooms were not ready yet so we left our bags in custody were very very nice and friendly we rented bikes in the afternoon when we returned to the hotel at around the new receptionists were not nice because they did not want to honor what the earlier receptionists offered to us regarding the bike rental period we were told we could use the bikes during a hour period of time meaning since we rented them at almost noon we could still use them the next day until noon but the afternoon receptionists said we couldn t and were rude about explaining why not to there were a man and a woman it was obvious the man was not happy about our claim when we ask him to please give us our luggage he just directed us to the room and pointed at our luggage so we could go and pick them up ourselves not that we couldn t do it by ourselves but his behaviour was not nice at all we couldn t park our bikes because there was not enough space so that same man said he would do it for us and later will bring the bike keys back to our rooms but after him and his boss woman decided not to honor our rental period and we complained about it he later called our room and told us we would have to go downstairs to get the keys opuselves we ended up not using the bikes the next day
