the hotel is minutes from the city center unless you take the train then it s less than minutes to amsterdam centraal the area around the hotel is industrial clean but boring there s nothing to do in the vicinity in my opinion the hotel is severly overpriced but it was the best we could do on a short notice and on an especially busy week end the toilet s door does not close properly and i personally do not like the open shower though it was working properly i don t like that type of shower
