we had such a drama on checking out i booked rooms for friends and myself both paying separately when we checked out however when i tried to pay and check out of my own room my card failed and i was forced to pay by my personal payment card on checking with the bank i had been charged twice for the room so i returned to the hotel and explained the situation that i had been charged twice the gentleman who dealt with my concern explained this is normal procedure that the hotel take an authoritative payment blocking money and then it is returned however it can take a number of days to return the payment not allowing me to complete the actual transaction for payment on the room i couldn t quite believe this was standard practice and therefore asked to speak to the manager no manager available surprising so who would help he then said there was a duty manager available why he wouldn t be suggested in place of the manager i do not know however the duty managed came to reception and immediately resolved the situation fantastic apologised for the problem agreed i was right and everything was put right he was kind enough to extend hospitality to my friends and partner who had been waiting some time whilst i argued with receptionist who was more interested in girls that were walking out the hotel than allowing me to explain the situation this is purely a mistake made on check out and of course took some time to resolve however i wanted to extend my thanks to the duty manage in his swift and very lovely approach to resolution this wouldn t put me off using this hotel again although perhaps the desk staff could benefit from additional training
