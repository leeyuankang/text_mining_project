breakfast buffet was poor standard price is ridiculous and the promo price we got it at was still too much we got there mins before breakfast was over and the food was dead as if was cooked hours ago and wasn t fresh the food should be fresh regardless of what time to arrive the selection was not great and boiled eggs were cold would advise against the breakfast here
