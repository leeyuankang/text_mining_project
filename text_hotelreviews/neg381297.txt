we arrived quite late and chose this hotel as we knew we wouldn t be travelling into the city that night we wanted a nice meal and bit of luxury annoying that we were only told after check in that the sky bar restaurant was closed told at reception this was due to refurbishment but later we found out from staff it was due to staff walkout atmosphere and morale in the bar was very flat and low only stayed for one drink and went back to our room to enjoy our supplies from the supermarket
