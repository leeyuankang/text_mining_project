one particular lady in the restaurant was very rude food was perfect service was sloppy my partner was given his meal but mine was given to the table next to us by the time that my meal came my partner had finished his meal was told that they would not take his meal away and put under the heat lamp as it wouldnt taste as nice not really our issue also was repeatedly told that they were under staffed once again as a paying customer not really our problem sorry
