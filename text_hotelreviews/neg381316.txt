i travel a lot and i can say this was the worst stay ever specially the staff i forgot the receptionist name but i remember maria or something she treated us like school boys without any respect or decency or professionalism luckily a gentleman receptionist called nick was present and was very nice man who helped a little bit this maria or sira or whatever should have proper training or sit at home
