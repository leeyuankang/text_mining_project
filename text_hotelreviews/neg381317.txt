the reception staff were rude and unhelpful and the worst thing was even though you prepaid through this site you were asked to produce the credit card you initially paid with luckily i had mine but hadn t seen this under your terms and conditions and four other people checking in had not seen it either and didn t have their initial credit card so they had to be refunded and repay which was causing extreme problems this has put me off using booking com in future and all the reception staff need sacking they are really so rude
