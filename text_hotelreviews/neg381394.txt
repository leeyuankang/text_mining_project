i booked this property based on the location reviews everyone was saying it was the best location only stop away on the sprinter they were right very near but next time i want one in the center to be really really close so i won t stay again because i want one in the centre but i will recommend this lovely hotel to anyone who s up for using public transport whilst on holiday
