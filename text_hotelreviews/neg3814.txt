location not far from gard de nord otherwise somewhat out of the way until we found our way around the metro which was good breakfast not impressive little choice coffee not hot bar had limited opening times closed early so no customers no atmosphere d cor seating was good so if the management put some effort into it would do a lot better ice bar was a great novelty but at we didn t fancy it perhaps next time we will brave it also a kettle in the room would be helpful
