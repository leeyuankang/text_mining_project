we were little disappointed to not have a bath in the room when all the photos show lovely roll top baths but the rain shower was good our cold tap was running hot too not something i d expect in such a pricey hotel but it is an old building i suppose as mentioned before they did let us take bottled water for free in recompense the breakfast options were a little limited and incredibly over priced considering how much the rooms are so we did not bother
