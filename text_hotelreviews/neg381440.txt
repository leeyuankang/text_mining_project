we paid for a double bed but we got two collated beds there was no top mattress overlapping the two beds consequently there was a rift in which we fell during the night the structure of the bathroom was designed in a way that the floor was flooded as soon as we took a shower when we wanted to use the mirror wash our hands we had to accept standing in wide puddles the area around the hotel is bleak we were forced to pay upfront on the day of our arrival but it was not stated on the website we used for the booking when we shared our surprise about this unexpected ask we were told that it was the policy of the hotel in a tone that made me feel like a walking wallet following this first contact i did not even dare bringing up the unacceptable issues we faced in our room it was the first time of my life i booked a room in a mercure hotel i never even considered booking a room before because mercure meant to me high end hotel with top quality and high price it was the last time of my life i booked a room in a mercure hotel
