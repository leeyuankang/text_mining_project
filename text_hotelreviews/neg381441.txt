the staff weren t overly helpful when checking in we arrived at and the room wasn t ready which was fair enough and were asked to wait until came back at and were told room still wasn t ready and to take a seat because the cleaning system hadn t been updated meanwhile everyone else checking in got straight in it was until one of our party went up at that something was done they clearly needed to review their cleaning schedule as by you d expect the room to be spotless and not have socks from previous customers lying about
