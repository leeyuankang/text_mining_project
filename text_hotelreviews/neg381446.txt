i stayed at mercure back in october as we upgraded to a superior room this included drinks in our mini bar small bottle of cola sprite and oj water too a lovely lady knocked on our door each day to fill this up although this time when me and my partner stayed even tho i paid extra for the superior room and facilities the drinks were not topped up once on our night stay this isn t a major issue but would have been nice very welcoming hotel great location train stop from amsterdam central
