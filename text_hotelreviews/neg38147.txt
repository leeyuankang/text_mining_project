no tea coffee making facilities in the room as standard although the staff did bring a tray when asked if we d like some and without prompting no bar restaurant and no breakfast room i should have checked when i booked and honestly it didn t adversely affect our stay at all but i do like a hotel bar before after going out in the evening
