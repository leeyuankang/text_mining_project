the tap water was not warm and we wasted the precious time in the trip we asked for reception and were told to wait until the hote water start to come they said it is natural because many guests use showers in the morning at the same time you know we waited until a m just before the check out time but the water never became warm unfortunately we lost the whole morning because of this we hope they will improve the water heating system
