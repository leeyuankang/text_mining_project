found ourselves in the hotels sky lounge very classy amazing views etc was very impressed but unfortunately the floor staff not so much returned a dish that was ordered as not what we asked for and this caused a huge scene within the restaurant between our table and waitress not very professional and embarrassing on the restaurants behalf could of been rectified in seconds with very little fuss after this we found that our table was avoided and waited minutes for our bill a massive let down also found very limited menu for lunch quite disappointing really would advise going into city centre we tried the hiltons sky lounge on our second day and wow did it live up to expectations amazing food amazing view right over the canal and amazing service they even made us our own personalised cocktails and to my final point on arrival we were offered breakfast as extra pp which i found pretty steep as we had paid pp for a family double room so would expect to be included in price after paying over in total even if just continental this also let our stay down
