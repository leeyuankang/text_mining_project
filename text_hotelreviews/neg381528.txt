since location is far from city center i wanted to use public transportation even though there are two train stations near by the hotel the staff didn t help when asked about public transportation forced me to use taxis the cushions in the room were dirty price too expensive not to include breakfast even though the hotel is only few months old but the mattress felt like its been years old no comfort at all
