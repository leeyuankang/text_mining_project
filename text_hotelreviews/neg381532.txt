dark colours of corridors like black tunnels wardrobes were very tall over feet so i couldn t reach top shelf and there was only one other so all our clothes that didn t hang were piled on one shelf there were no drawers anywhere so all make up ipads phones keys etc etc just littered the windowsills or the dressing table made the room look untidy the shower was great but the bathroom door clashed against the wardrobe door when it was open the bedroom seemed to be a triumph of design over functionality
