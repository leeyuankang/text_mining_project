the mini bar had the previous persons half eaten food still in there vile when i had spoke to the staff about it they said it would be sorted whilst i was out only to return for it to be still in there they told me to leave it outside the room myself overall i liked the cleanliness of the hotel however when the door is shut in our room we noticed that we could see hand prints which have been smeared down the door
