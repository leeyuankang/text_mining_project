no air conditioning for nights we asked at check in to make sure it worked as we had read in previous reviews it had not we were told it was being fixed the next day but you guessed it was not i don t think they own a vacuum cleaner as carpets throughout the building were very dirty we started to notice the poor workmanship throughout the building tiling painting wallpaper etc just not finished off like they were in a hurry our room was on the second floor above the outside bar so noise and smoke were a problem at night we have spent weeks in europe and this place was the most disappointing
