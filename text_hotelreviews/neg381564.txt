the air conditioner was broken the city was hot and there wasn t another room available no one warned us about this and did not receive any discount this function fails because when booking this convenience contained in the room the breakfast is very expensive so stay tuned if it is included in the reserve because in one of my reservation was not included the hotel is in a very distant point from the downtown and attractions you need to subway tram bus for everything you have a station closer and the central station is the next stop from subway but the subway tram ticket is expensive few restaurants around
