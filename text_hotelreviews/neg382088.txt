firstly only booked this hotel because i thought it was the doubletree at amsterdam central next i had to take a minute ferry ride to this place it should be renamed to avoid this error that many other tourists have fell prey to it is not up to the hilton standards that is for sure lucky they kicked in a free breakfast as this place sits in an abandoned shipping yard the surroundings are not the nicest by any standard
