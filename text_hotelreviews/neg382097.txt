there was no dinner menu on saturday as the chef apparently had a busy lunch service and was not able to prep for the evening menu pathetic for a major hotel chain only light snacks were available breakfasts were busy but a lack of staff and one morning running out of simple things such as butter the sink in our bathroom was some quirky sloping modern affair totally impractical for normal use such as having a wet shave etc no bath just a walk in shower with low water pressure the car park has no security cameras and no warning your vehicle could be at risk and is simply an area with a high fence and a barrier which is basically pointless my car was broken into during my stay causing hundreds of pounds worth of damage
