upon arrival you have to pay a euro holding fee on a debit or credit card which i was aware of before we arrived i handed over the card and when we left i was given a receipt to say that i would be getting the money back when i arrived home i found out that they also taken another payments from my card for each luckily i contacted the bank and they refunded me for the transactions as i had not agreed for this money to be taken these payments were taken by a brooklyn hotel which i found out was the name of the hotel before it went to being a hilton so beware when handing over your card that they aren t actually taking more money than what they should be i paid the balance for the room in cash so they had no reason to take additional money other than the deposit
