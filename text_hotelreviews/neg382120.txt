we stayed in this hotel a couple of times before it was owned or at least branded by hilton when it was less than half the price it is now i know amsterdam is expensive but this hotel is not good value for money beware if you re trying to impress a new partner with a fancy hotel there is no soundproofing between the toilet and bedroom
