we went to the other double tree hilton hotel by central station by mistake we were directed to the correct location advised to get the ferry and then it was a hop and a jump away we were not told that there are two ferries running so we got the wrong one it took us mins to find and get to the hotel this involved walking through industrial sites and building sites i was not impressed especially when we got to the hotel and right outside is the ferry terminal other than that we had a great time
