despite having breakfast included in the package when we reach restaurant to have it in the morning reception people didn t inform the restaurant staff it becomes embarrassing that you are waiting so that you can have breakfast thanks to staff in restaurant they covered it nicely next day again same thing happened reception people are not bother about it and the amount of money hotel charged the room size was very unexpected it was too small that it s very hard to walk inside room being the most expensive hotel of our trip the experience was not good
