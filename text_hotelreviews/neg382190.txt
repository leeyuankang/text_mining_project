room was really small and it was noisy outside and inside we could only sleep with earplugs as it sounded in our room as if someone showered all night glad we were only there for night book the right view otherwise you will regret it the information the intern gave us when we arrived was poor and she was unfriendly in my opinion a blanket was missing in our room and the shelf in the wardrobe was very unstable
