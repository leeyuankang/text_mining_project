our major criticism of this hotel is their booking and check in policy payment for your room is deducted from your credit card soon after making your booking which in our case was several weeks before we arrived then on top of this at check in we were asked to pay an extra deposit that we felt was inappropriate we have never encountered this kind of policy before despite staying in many very fine hotels throughout europe it seems that double tree hilton doesn t have much faith in you as a guest unfortunately this experience soured our trip and we ll be avoiding this outfit in the future
