i booked rooms the same when we arrived they said it was both with views i asked for the better one as we had just got engaged so i wanted it to be special which was a sea view they gave us the wrong room we complained got told it would get sorted none of the staff communicated with each other so it didn t happen complained again and got told to come down at to get upgraded was without a room until then to just get the first room we had booked so it wasn t an upgrade and we wouldn t have bothered changing if we new this was the case but they had promised us the best room in the hotel to compensate we got locked out of our room the one night and the guy working had no idea what to do just kept saying it had never happened before we had to tell him to phone a manager or somebody to sort it as we were not happy about the situation it was totally unprofessional how he handled it considering the hilton is a big chain and should be able to sort that out immediately got no apologies for this incident
