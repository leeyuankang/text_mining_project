i strictly advised at my booking that i needed twin room and need speedy check in due to my pricise visit to the city for my business but first of all at out arrival around we were given wrong room then we were told to go to another room where there were no lights working then we had to wait without keys and going all around the hotel with the staff member wasting time being so tired and needing sleep we were straight away refused to be offered any kind of help even when the management being wrong then we were told by the member that there was no staff or no manager available and nothing can be done then i called other branch and the lady over the phone tried to explain the receptionist how to operate the system to check availability of other empty rooms taking the height of disappointment we had to accept the offer to sleep in the different room without full facilities and the room was handed over to us around nearly this had wasted the entire trip for which we travelled all the way to holland we had to wake up to go for the conference which we missed due to all this drama going on around i totally am disappointed that my entire trip went to waste just because of a hotel so unprofessional and the staff being totally disrespectful
