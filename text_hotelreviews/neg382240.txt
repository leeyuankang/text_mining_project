if i missed the mention of the security deposit in my email then ok but that was unexpected and we were young people on a budget make that more clear also the location the free ferry was fair enough but the facilities actually around the hotel were terrible i personally wandered around for over half an hour with absolutely no place to get what i needed cigarettes the hotel need a machine even one the staff can use for customers in case of emergencies because this was an actual issue for me and my friend we did not realize the level of isolation there the dark and quiet area is a little intimidating at night the bathroom door in our room wouldn t shut fully either i m not sure if that was how it was meant to be but between that and the fact that it was made of pure glass meant myself and my friend had literally no privacy what so ever
