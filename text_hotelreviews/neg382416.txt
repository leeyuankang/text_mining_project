the restaraunt here is ok not superb when it comes to starters but pretty good with main dishes like fish the nes street gets very loud at night because the red light district is nearby and couple of popular restaraunts are located in the neighbourhood the windows overlook business centre with glass walls so you d better not walk around naked
