the motif of the hotel was modernist and looks good however there was a distinct lack of practicality in the rooms for instance lack of storage space in shower i had to place my shampoo and razor on the floor of the shower there was no place to lay my bathroom kit and no place to lay my toothbrush or comb or other items also the chairs in the room looked good and allowed you to sink back into a near reclined position however they were entirely impractical when i needed a place to sit to put my shoes and socks on
