well despite my comment that the room was quiet the door was actually not so sound proof anyone being outside would sound like being inside the room not so many people running around so that helped like many european boutique hotels in general air conditioning is almost unheard of this place would probably get very stuffy in summer unless they have some master control to rule them all personally i would prefer no more than degrees at night this was more than that and this was at winter quilts are very warm so i was actually sweating a bit but i m probably more sensitive to this than most it would ve been possible to open the window though should the need have ocurred albeit at the expense of some noise
