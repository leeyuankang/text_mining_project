we booked on the basis of having a nice lobby with fireplace to relax in and warm up after a day out doing touristy stuff the hotel photos give the impression that the hotel lobby provides this however the lobby is in fact a busy restaurant and the area around the feature fireplace which was not lit once the three night we stayed there in january brrrr only has two armchairs and a sofa which was often occupied by the restaurant users plus this area was closed off when the restaurant was closed so you couldn t chill there past c there is a small lobby area beside the reception but it s not a cosy place to relax i suspect there was more comfy seats around the fireplace at some point but they were removed to put more tables in to the busy and popular restaurant also i suspect the fire isn t lit as it will be too close to said extra tables however we banked on there being a cosy lobby that we could relax in whenever we wanted without having to feel like we had to order a drink and a fire to warm our weary bones but we got neither the only but significant disappointing thing about an otherwise lovely hotel stay
