our one challenge was that not all taxis seem to know this hotel and its vehicle access is challenging from the main street because we had a bad taxi experience the hotel v provided us with complimentary breakfast for our three mornings definitely above and beyond we d definitely recommend this hotel but suggest calling ahead to make taxi arrangements with their preferred company
