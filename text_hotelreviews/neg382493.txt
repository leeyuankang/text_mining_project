the room temperature is regulated centrally means when i arrived it was ice cold i spoke to the reception and they were first reluctant to change the temperature since this was affecting all other rooms on the floor as well since another guest was also freezing they did change it and with the heating on it got acceptable the coffee machine in the room was old and rusty wouldnt want to put water in the container i was on the thrid floor and in the room was a constant sound from the air conditioning even though it was turned off my friend slept on the floor and it was very loud from other guests and the restaurant until late at night wouldnt return to that hotel
