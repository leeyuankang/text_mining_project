the concierge was virtually non existent they struggled to give us advice on where to eat among other things one particularly frustrating experience was on a saturday night where they suggested we go to a certain street and just look around i stated that a saturday night on easter long weekend is not exactly the best time to just look around and they then advised a restaurant that they said shouldn t have more than a minute wait we went and the restaurant turned us away saying that it was over and a half hour wait then we called back to our hotel concierge and asked for help as it was getting late and we needed some assistance they then claimed to have made us a reservation to a different restaurant and we showed up and the restaurant had no notice of our reservation fortunately we were able to make friends with the staff and after a tip they sat us in about minutes one drink at the bar was really a frustrating experience trying to use the concierge services at v nesplein also on other nights as well the were very reluctant and or unable to assist most of the time we just relied on recommendations we came with from other friends and or people we met in town this is inconsistent with hotels i ve stayed at that are supposed to be trendy i e standard in nyc etc who go out of their way for concierge to help with each meal reservation and nightclub assistance in addition to this we arranged various activities in the city i e van gogh museum tulip festival tickets etc through the hotel however when we got to the van gogh museum we found out that we still had to wait in lines for those attractions even though we pre bought tickets we learned from the museum that you can get e tickets directly online and you don t wait in line and save significantly more it would have been considerate for the concierge to inform us of this
