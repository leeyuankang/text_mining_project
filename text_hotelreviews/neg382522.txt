we took the expensive suite where sadly design was preferred over practicality there is no need in a room for two sofas two couches and two coffee tables while there is a great need for a real closet rather than a few open shelves also its totally unacceptable not to have a decent hotel fridge rather a drawer fridge that only fits cans especially in the suite the bed was and not as indicated on the site its a difference also one side of the bed had a sunken mattress a single very slow elevator
