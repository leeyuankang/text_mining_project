clean but not spotless furniture was scarce curtains smelled funny i think it was just the material they are made of and not wanting of cleaning i totally dislike the style colors are gloomy and it s like being in the waiting room of an old time london train station however this is just a matter of taste and not an indisputable minus there is no real lobby to speak of just a couple of horribly worn out couches guess it s a matter of taste again
