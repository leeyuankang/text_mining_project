too pricey for what if offers i asked for a european plug and the recipcient asked if i can pick it from the lobby because she is alone i know the standrads varies in cities and culture but this is quiet too casual for what you pay for this is a hotel that charged euros a night lobby is too small and no vibe just sofas facing the wall and a bathroom entrance staff needs a lot of training on how to talk to guest i asked for non smoking room and the guy who checked me in told me twice no smoking in the room
