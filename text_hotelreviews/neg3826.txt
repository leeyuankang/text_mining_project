fitness club was out of order which was the only reason i booked this particular hotel for the price the staff were vague about the situation and it never got fixed during our day stay and there are no parks nearby for running there were some strangely quirky aspects to the room layour that didn t make sense like a shower with no door or curtain which left an inch of water on the bathroom carpet there was no drain in the floor and all of this meant we could only take baths all week
