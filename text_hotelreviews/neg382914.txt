we stayed here years ago and we can easily say the rooms furniture and carpets and hallways need to be updated we have come back to this hotel for the excellent services esp breakfast quality and diversity so we can have an objective opinion on the need to maybe refurbish and replace carpets we stayed in a quiet room and everything was perfect until our last night when from a building across the hotel the inside atrium our peace was disturbed by a three hour long very loud and noisy gathering if this situation repeats the hotel should contact the neighbours
