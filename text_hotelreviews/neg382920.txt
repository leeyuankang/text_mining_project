unfortunately there is just one warm offer at breakfast sausages and scrambled eggs only although the same class hotels in vienna offer a much larger selection keep in mind that for families with children or unfamiliar people it is better to avoid such an offer since glass cabin are without curtain although it is in the photo anyway it seems not very convenient my room wasn t supplied with teapot and related items tea coffee apples in the hotel were the most tasteless in addition at second and following days apples were haven t served any more in sauna it all were completely rotten although after my remarks it were replaced turkish sauna is completely useless it does not work as it should slippers are not available so you need to bring your own so not to walk barefoot in general it is nothing to do for more than half an hour in sauna you can stand under a power shower but huge pools are forming on the floor then so you may feel ashamed with other guests
