the staff was cold and when asked about parking said that the hotel s about day is full and my only option was the next hotel didn t mention though asked that there usa a park and ride facility close with and despite the free wifi policy they have a rule printed that if you want to connect a second devise you need to upgrade to business package with day she informed us about this charge when asked and i was ready to call booking but their system allows second connection without charge following the policy so the whole thing is at least misleading
