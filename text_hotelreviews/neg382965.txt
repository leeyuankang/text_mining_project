there are sleeping issues which is unfortunate for a hotel the pillow was too thin but wide enough to double fold it and then it turned out fine the mattress is completely covered with some plastic cover which is a sin as this prevents nightly sweating to be taken care of a plastic protection cover is fine but then let guests sleep on a thick molton sheet below the normal linen sheet i wrapped myself in the duvet by this one too double folding it it was wide enough for a single sleeper to do this but two people would have had a problem by the way the duvet did not fully cover the mattress so even without the sweating issue two people would have had a problem covering themselves unless house keeping provides an additional one two minor points the room s key card did not always function immediately when removing the card from the holder the lights went out immediately a time delay of a few seconds would not leave the guest in complete darkness while still in the room i was glad to have been able to cope with the sleeping issues as i did not want to prematurely leave this otherwise excellent hotel
