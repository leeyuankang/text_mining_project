the only thing we did not appreciate was that every morning someone would just come into the room after knocking only once to check if we needed anything from the minibar i mean we could have been showering or getting dressed and we would have not been able to cover up let alone tell them not to come in we then realized that in order to prevent this we should have put the do not disturb sign outside the door i still think a great hotel such as this one should review this practice
