the door card locks are tricky to operate you need to get the exact speed and pressure when swyping otherwise the door won t open and the apartments are in a separate building when we after repeated efforts couldn t unlock the we went to reception to ask for help the receptionist i believe named mr lakatos or similar was extremely annoyed and rude and barely agreed to accompany us to unlock the room this is not how the guests should be treated
