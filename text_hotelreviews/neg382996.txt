the receptionist seemed to have a bad day from my side i felt a arrogant and superior attitude towards me which is the worst feeling as you just arrive and it is late a receptionist cannot have this attitude the first impression was lost wednesday late evening at around i was put in a room which is usually for disabled people so the washroom looks unfamiliar the room was clean and actually quite nice of course it would have been great to be in a regular room at least the receptionist could have mentally prepared me for that but he also failed on that point its a irrational point that i am making here but this stuff counts when dealing with customers things like that add up if the first moment was lost
