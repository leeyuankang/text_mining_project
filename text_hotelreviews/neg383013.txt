the layout of the room is a bit quirky you may like it or not the shower cubicle is transparent and is outside the toilet so your roommate will see you while you shower may be a problem for someone travelling with a friend in a twin room for example i tried the restaurant for lunch and i have to say the food was a bit disappointing although service was good
