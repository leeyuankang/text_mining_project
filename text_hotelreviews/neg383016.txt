hotel location on a very busy main road with sex shops close by the pillows were way too soft and although the room was very nice i m not sure about the shower being next to the bed and open to view fine if you re travelling alone but not if you are travelling with another person no privacy i would also have liked to see more english style breakfast items i e bacon grilled tomatoes etc
