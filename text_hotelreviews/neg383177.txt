i confirmed the arrival at via booking com e mail as this hotel has a hour reception upon arrival i was informed that my reservation was cancelled due to their policy of cancelling if a guest doesn t show up until that wasn t mentioned anywhere and is directly opposite of what was agreed with the staff so i had to pay directly to the hotel and not via booking com whatsoever which costed me eur more than what it should have costed vs eur as a sign of their hospitality they upgraded the room to a better one comfort deluxe room what can you do at but accept the terms of the hotel which purposely avoided booking com rules with a made up story
