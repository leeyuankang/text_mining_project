the wifi was very bad in one of our rooms we booked two double rooms except in the bathroom while in the other room was fine the location itself is not a just walking distance to action places but you need to ride once or even more it can t be really negative if you enjoy riding trams and like to have a look on city streets it s a nice experience in vienna anyway the normal double room not the special room came with no shampoo there s the shower gel of course that is shampoo as well but not all things granted in the special room no fridge and weak wifi but no really difference in size or any other thing we booked both that s why it was easy to compare
