i was badly injured when a heavy shower screen came off the bathroom wall hitting me on the head cutting and bruising me and rendering me unconscious before the hotel staff would call a doctor they wanted to see my passport which they had already seen at check in and told me that each visit by the doctor would cost me the accident and the concussion that followed totally spoilt our break the hotel refunded of my room costs but not those of my friend who stayed in the hotel to care for me and arranged a taxi for me to see some of the sights of vienna before it was time to go home but our stay was ruined
