terrible staff very rude no wifi connection in the rooms even though it states they have wifi we had to use the lobby when we complained they did nothing not even change our room extremely poor customer service the business center computers were old slow and poor internet connection when i asked a question at the front desk they were very short and abrupt when i checked out the clerk rolled her eyes and looked at her coworker as if she was annoyed with me i will say the restaurant service was very good and excellent breakfast buffet but very rude front desk concierge
