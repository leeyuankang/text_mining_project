would have liked if they reminded me about euro charge for breakfast at check in could use more towels in bathroom also the pillows on the bed were very small and flat also the staff could be more knowledgeable about public transport i was asking about whether ubahn was a good way to get somewhere and they said that i should just walk because ubahn was not close to location however i found out later that the tram went right from hotel to my location and would have saved me the long walk had they told me
