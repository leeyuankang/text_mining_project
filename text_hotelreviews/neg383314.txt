my wife had paid two months in advance for this hotel room and i was nearly refused entry because i produced a different visa card upon arrival i was even threatened that they would call the police i had called the hotel when it was booked and wanted to be assured of a quiet room at the back yes they would do that yet i had lucky room facing the busy road the room was dirty with two large black hair in my bidet lucky for me the staff knew the person the hairs would have come from the cleaning lady that was the best evidence that the cleaning lady had actually been in that room wifi did not work in my room and i had to sit in the reception area for that
