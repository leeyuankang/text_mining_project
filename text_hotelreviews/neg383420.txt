both baths didn t run work needed a new toilet people were smoking next to us and this came into our room we hate smoking the bathroom needs a extractor fan as it steamed up we tried many times to use the gym and only managed once on the last day i had booked so my son could use the gym so my son was very disappointed we would have used the restaraunt more but unfortunately although the staff were very friendly the restaurant itself was dated and food not very nice which was a shame we felt the beds were a bit hard but a good size would have been nice to have a movie channel the area was in a good location but i felt a little unsafe as the first night some homeless people were making a fire and the police dragged them away and a few nights later they returned with all their trolleys and slept outside and were a bit noisy this put us off sitting outside
