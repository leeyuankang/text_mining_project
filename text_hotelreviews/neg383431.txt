a star hotel that had no in room information about any on site amenities like restaurant or gym only a brochure about massage we went to ask about food and they referred us outside the hotel after a turbulent flight and jet lag that wasn t optimal for us we reserved a mini room which would have been sufficient for our very short stay and were upgraded but a staffer lectured us that the room wasn t really appropriate for adults more for young people traveling and warned that next time we would not be guaranteed an upgrade
