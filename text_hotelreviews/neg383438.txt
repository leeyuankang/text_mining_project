the room was very noisy with a large gap betweem the entrance door and the floor so you could hear all the noises from the hallway we barely slept also the shower was wery hard to use and we had to leave the water running for minutes before it was hot the hotel has stars but it should be rated at very basic room with highly overpriced minibar we will not return here
