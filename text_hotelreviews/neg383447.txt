the dining room was old fashioned the breakfast was cold every day the people who worked in the dining area were not very friendly u were hard pushed to get a drink in the bar due to it closing early the hotel itself was lovely but there was no pool and it was quite expensive to stay there it definitely needed more amenities the reception staff were friendly and helpful so was the manager
