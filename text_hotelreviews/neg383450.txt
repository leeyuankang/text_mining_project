there were no coffee tea making facilities in the room a small downside but would have been nice to have the option the breakfast was very poor i would not recommend including the breakfast in your stay as there are lots of small coffee shops bakery s cafes etc all around barcelona so you will find something in no time there is a little cafe just down the road from the hotel
