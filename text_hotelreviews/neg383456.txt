about the only negative things i can say about our stay at the acta hotel is the lighting system in the room could have been a little brighter a chair in the room would have helped and maybe a plug in or two around the couch area these are not strong negative comments i would recommend this hotel to anyone and i would stay there again if i ever return to this great city
