wifi was really bad the very first day we had breakfast we were severy dissapointed by it as it did not include anything spanish and as well as the food was underwhelming compared to the price from next days we started eaiting at a nearby bakery which was really good compared to the room price it did not offer any facilities in the hotel such as pool or good gym
