the worst lack off sleep ever and this from a frequent traveller due to a mattress that felt it was half filled with rags actually moved to the floor at one point it was that uncomfortable air conditioning that only blew hot air and a fridge that developed a fault midway through the night to sound like a stroke motorcyle we switched it off no ironing facilities onsite which i felt was very poor for a star and of no use if staying short term as we were next day paid for service rooms were also noisy and actually thought our neighbours had accessed our room at one point through the night sort these issues out and this place could be great as the communal areas styling was very nice and the rooms good enough room
