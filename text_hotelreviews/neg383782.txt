having clearly requested an outward looking room i was checked into a small claustrophobic internal room less than half size m squared that was advertised looking onto a wall for almost quite incredible when i requested change i was told i wasn t paying enough and if i wanted better room i should have paid for a junior suite although i was finally moved for second night it was most appalling experience i have had at any hotel
