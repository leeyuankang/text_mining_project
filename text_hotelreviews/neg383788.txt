there was some confusion about the following items but we didn t want to make a big deal out of it since we just wanted to enjoy our special day and night there was confusion during breakfast the lady told us that it is included in our price and that we can have a buffet or something from the menu we chose something from the menu got charged for it and then were told that only buffet is for free that was not clear to us when given the available options we asked for a late checkout but it wasn t clear that if we stay until we will still have to pay extra in my experience late checkouts are free first of all we spoke about that to the gentleman by the reception in the morning and he was clear that if we come even minute after he ll have to charge us for the next day there was nothing being said about getting charged for the extension of the first day in the first place then when we came back at to check out the lady behind the counter didn t really have any information about the discourse from the morning and we just didn t want to make too big of a deal so we just paid for it so it would be nice if these things were clear from the start that is all otherwise you are left in a weird situation where you don t really know what to do since you don t have any written proof of the conversation that took place
