unfortunately there was some confusion with booking com re the days of my stay i feel the hotel was quite rigid not flexible accommodating or willing to negotiate with them in this circumstance and i found this to be a disappointing juxtaposition contrast to the great service experience i encountered with the staff during my stay they said there was no availability on the day i ended up extending my stay to glad i did not let this pre stay experience tarnish my impression of the hotel the windows are small in and wish they provided a bit more light not all rooms have bathtubs
