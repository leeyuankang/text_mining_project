we booked a private tour of the canals on the day we left we thought our flight was leaving at but it was and the people next room to us were very noisy all night so sleep wasnt great it s fine these things happen in life but when we were told that we had to pay over euro s for a cancelled boat ride well that just ruined the holiday and as of my greatest friends recommended your hotel that is where stayed for our first trip to amsterdam i am a very loyal customer when it comes to hotels but we ll all be trying the intercontinental and other options from here on out
