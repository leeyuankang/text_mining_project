initially the hotel gave me a completely inacceptable room with windows towards an inner small courtyard directly outside was apparently the way to some hotel installations pool which meant to have curtains constantly closed or people directly looking into the room only after protesting i got a more acceptable albeit then also smaller room on the day the cleaning of the room was interrupted for about hours and again i had to protest to get it finally done definitely not the level of customer treat one can expect from a star hotel much too overpriced for what it provides in terms of quality and service
