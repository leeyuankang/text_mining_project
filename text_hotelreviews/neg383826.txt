whether this was a fluke and despite the fact that they gave me some credit this experience should not be generalized due to some exceptional people like the manager i dealt with jonathan from front and dionne from room service the credit is justified and i have to write the review and share my experience the credit is not meant to keep the story untold except for the flooding which was caused by another guest that left their shower on then created the leak to my room there are other aspects that are very poor the leak was excusable it was not caused by the hotels condition the leak happened on our last day that disaster was the icing on the cake still the leak on my shoes and fox fur jacket wet i never got to wear it the manager offered to help but after repeated issues i couldn t trust the service my problem with this hotel is its poor service by the select few lack of attention to details and subpar in room food dining my first day front desk offered to place dinner reservations at a restaurant that i had looked forward to going i wish i never had accepted their assistance it was meant to be for a date days from my arrival the same night i received a letter confirming the dinner was made on a different day hence i lost my place and had to go somewhere else it was a good place but was not my choice also on the same night of arrival i set up a cake to be delivered on a certain day this cake was delivered on the wrong day which ruined my surprise i also asked for an i room massage which at first was confirmed on a different day and had i not caught on i wouldn t have been able to correct it so the massage appt was done right but only because i caught the mistake beforehand on top of this the front kept calling my room to inform us of the cake and dinner reservations concierge knew it was a surprise so basically they blew the surprise by talking to the birthday celebrant
