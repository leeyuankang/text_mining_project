the hotel was redecorating it was not like the pictures shows it can be barely recognized it was a long way from elevator to my room lots of doors just imagine you are carrying one or two suitcases and you still have to open the doors again and again when you walking through a very long way besides nobody is intending to help you terrible experience the in room breakfast was not on time i was almost late on the morning very old decorations not clean enough it was definitely not worth for the price
