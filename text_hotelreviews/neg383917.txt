first of all booking com should remove the smoking option as the hotel is smoke free apparently so that was the first welcome note entered the room and found bugs on the bed with another around the windows we didn t find this pleasant either ac was okay during the day but always hot at night no one bothered to fix it breakfast selection is very limited and takes them ages to deliver your omelet and or pancakes from the kitchen although it was almost empty i must admit that the pancakes are worth the wait though the capacity at the breakfast area is limited so expect to be welcomed with a you can wait a while for a table which was the first time i experience such a thing at any hotel i have ever visited they normally seat you immediately and they should have at least offered us to sit in the bar seating area which is right next to the breakfast area all in all found the hotel decent but over priced for sure and i m not sure what s the hype in the reviews about the location as we didn t see anything special about it would we stay here again nop
