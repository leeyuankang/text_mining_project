claim to fame for this hotel is that sisi stayed there well today she will not be able to move in the room because her skirts will be too big i pity the staff who has to work for nh no airconditioning on the ground floor when i arrived it was hot outside inside it was almost unbearable the airconditioning in the rooms are also totally useless at night there is so much noise from the street no fault of the hotel noisy travellers that one had to close the window and it was not comfortable i took the duvet out of the cover and slept under that i did as for a single top sheet for the rest of my stay but they do not seem to have any my bed was made with another duvet cover but main complaint the room i was allocated was call de lux or whatever but there was nowhere to put a suitcase i placed it under the window and then fell over it every time i passed it about on one side of the bed about cm at the end of the bed and a bit more on the other side where there was a little desk with a television in line with the headboard of the bed so one has to sit at the foot of the bed to see the tv screen sit either on an office chair or a horrible little pink pouffe at the end of the bed
