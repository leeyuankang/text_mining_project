the room was a superior double with view it is poor value for money for the room is quite small just enough room to walk past the end of the bed the room badly needs more drawer space two very small drawers under the dresser just enough for toiletries and one other drawer under the safe not enough drawer space for four nights the bathroom is very modern and clean
