the first room they showed us was tiny there was nowhere to put your suitcase and the sink was in the bedroom and not the bathroom there were a couple of practical things missing from the room we actually stayed in which was much nicer and bigger than the first one and they were a soap dish there was nowhere to put the handsoap next to the sink and a luggage rack
