the fact you have to give a deposit on top of the payment hotel orangised a taxi at a fixed rate for us which was not true i ended up paying for a chocolate bar off the min bar in the room in which we did not eat or even know there was chocolate bars in the room the hotel said they would not charge for this but still did and took for it restaurant did not have steak knifes which is really poor when they have steak on the menu breakfast is per morning per person which is a rip off one of the staff behind the main desk was really pushy about paying more money for upgrades and add ons which made me feel uncomfortable
