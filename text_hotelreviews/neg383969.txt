we couldn t get on wifi from our room but then again we didn t notify the staff of the issue i believe the wifi caps at mb every hours it was a minor inconvenience since we relied on our cell data plan bought locally if you like a quiet night for sleeping on the weekend only then you should ask for a room facing the city and not the canal that faces the entertainment district
