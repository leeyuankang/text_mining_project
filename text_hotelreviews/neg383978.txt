we had to ask for a price adjustment as they could only provide one room with a view if we hadn t we would have been charged for two rooms with a view the larger room which was over the nieuwe doelenstraat was perfect apart from the fact that in the recent refurb nh had not thought to put in double glazing the air con was good but even with the windows closed the street noise was somewhat disturbing on our last night the hotel received deliveries of linen at which lasted for and sounded like someone was throwing steel crates around having got back to sleep we were woken again at by a delivery of consumables for the hotel again which went on for over mins i rang reception and was told this was normal for the hotel to receive deliveries overnight i asked if they could stop the delivery but was told no on checking out we mentioned this again to be told that our and other complaints had been passed to management but no mention if management would do anything i suggested perhaps getting daytime deliveries or double glazing the noise problem for rooms with no view is something you should be aware of especially if you are a light sleeper as the road outside is rarely quiet
