the hotel listed airconditioning as part of their room offerings upon arrival when the room didnt cool enough i was informed that what they have is more of a climate control system and not airconditioning so the room was a bit too warm for my liking this was however rectified as they provided a few fans for us to place around the room also we were told by the restaurant staff that breakfast was included in our stay which is why we ate at the hotel later on at checkout we were informed that this wasn t the case and that we would have to pay however when we informed them of the scenario they waived off the charges so where they stumbled they were willing to rectify which is a very good thing
