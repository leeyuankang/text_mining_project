staff service leaves something to be desired polite yes but informative no in light of the price charged for the breakfast the value of it can be improved by making sure that the cooked components stay hot the eggs were lukewarm borderline cold the pastries and other continental components of the breakfast were of a high standard however you may find noise from the street to be an issue during certain times of the year it did not bother me too much
