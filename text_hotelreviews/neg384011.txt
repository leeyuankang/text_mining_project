roof leak on the second night we were watching tv in the evening and heard what sounded like the shower going by itself i walked into the hall and saw that the roof was leaking it was literally pouring out like a shower head the water was not leaking in one place neither it was leaking all over the place in what looked like a pipe style configuration all around the outside and in the lines horizontally i called the duty manager who came to have a look and he said they would try and find us another room we told him we didn t want to move as it was late the following day we didn t hear from the manager or receive an apology despite being told he would get back to us which was disappointing on the customer services part see photos for roof leak evidence the roof continued to drip and bubble the roof over the course of our stay and started to look like it might fall in by the time we checked out check out upon checking out were told we had to pay another for the room upgrade which actually really annoyed me as we were told that the room was upgraded for free so i piped up pulled out our receipt and told the chap that we were given the upgrade for free and despite this we also had been given a room with water leaking through the roof to be honest i thought they should have offered a discount because of this as we had not created a fuss but instead they tried to charge us more i really couldn t believe it and was not happy about this at all no apology given and now they are trying to overcharge us the guy spoke in dutch to another staff member so i didn t know what they were saying they took off the overcharge and then charged us for city tax which was also very annoying because there was no mention of this when checking in and because we were under the impression we paid in full when checking in
