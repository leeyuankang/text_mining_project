we arrived late due to easyjet delaying the flight for three hours they guy on the reception desk said that he had no booking for us but eventually found it noone to help with luggage or show us to our room our room was very noisy the first night due to nearby restaurants and bars also our windows were covered by polythene due to some renovations so we had absolutely no view of anything we did get a slight reduction on the room rate but it still spoiled our stay and we felt they should not have been using the affected rooms our complaint seemed to come as a complete surprise to the staff really
