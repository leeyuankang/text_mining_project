the first room i was given was really good but it was at the first floor on the street side so i could hear people partying until and cars and motorbikes passing by i asked if a room was available at the upper floors but the room i was given was absolutely not a star hotel room it was like the luxurious version of a little princess attic the sink was inside the room i could barely walk between the window and the bed the wardrobe didn t even have drawers the mini bar didn t even have snacks i didn t even know where to put my suitcase the bathroom didn t have heating which was ok because it wasn t too cold outside but i can t imagine during the winter i entered the room got undressed and after five minutes a guy came in without even knocking he left without apologizing and didn t explain the reason why he came in i was quite speechless about a room i was paying more than a night they didn t give me a discount or even offered breakfast my overall experience was not satisfying at all
