despite being sympathetic to the nice young team of personnel the service was bad they delayed my cleaning for a whole extra day did not refill my minibar and as for breakfast one morning i came at am sharply and nobody paid attention to me for mins they started doing things at actually the other morning i came at the hot time and during the hot time they forgot my orders to be sure they did not charge me for the minibar and the cleaning this of course was a nice and proper thing but should not the team better work on the quality of service instead of loosing the money
