our room was not cleaned up to and we had specially request clean service and wait outside minutes this is as more strange as somebody managed to grab tips from our room which we left for clean service there were only decaffeinated coffee pods for nespresso machine distributed every day hopefully there are few very good cafes at rembrandt square so we just walked there the window in the shower room is not isolated at all there is gap between the window and the cant through which you can clearly see the channel that is why it was very cold in shower room we had to put big bath towel for thermal isolation onto the window probably this would not be an issue during the summer time
