the air conditioner leaked the first evening as well as the drain in the shower was slow to drain we put in a maintenance order online for these to be fixed the drain was repaired and it seemed the air conditioner was fixed as well unfortunately the second night the air conditioner began to leak again we were kept awake both evenings of our stay we were given a discount but felt we should have received more given we did not sleep well also the room was extremely small it was difficult for two people to move about the room there are less expensive hotels nearby with better amenities
