the room was very small with no view out either window and the bed was very uncomfortable with a definite dip in the middle we both had sore backs after the forst nights sleep which only got worse over the next couple of nights in additiiin the door was pretty much at the end of the bed and opened outwards on to the hallway therfore every time the door opened other guests can get a good view of you in or sitting on the bed ithink we were just disappointed because the room was nothing like any of the pictures on the website and the very clever photo of the hotel front is just as deceptive
