the two things i didn t like were using booking com usually allows one to cancel a reservation i didn t want to or need to cancel but it was alarming to discover that this wouldn t have been possible if i had needed to every other place i ve stayed from booking com has allowed a cancellation so this is an unwelcome and very stringent policy on your part also i know amsterdam is expensive but this was still a really expensive stay and most of the people i know even frequent travelers to europe would never consider staying at such an expensive place the price absolutely should have included breakfast i would object to the price much less if it did
