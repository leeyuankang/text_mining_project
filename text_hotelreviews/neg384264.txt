temperature control was a little off and cold air was coming in from under the door but it didn t bug me much wifi died for like minutes the only thing that bugged me was a bad smell that came from the bathroom a little bit like sewage i didn t spend much time in the room and it wasn t as noticable if you closed the door again nothing really major to complain
