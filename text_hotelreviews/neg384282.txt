we had such poor sleep the room was small with far too much furniture making it feel ever so cramped the mattress topper moved about and the bed creaked terribly and also gave me and my wife backache it woke us nearly every time we turned over poor natural daylight in the room due to facing a wall courtyard and other hotel room windows which gave no privacy when the curtains were open we were woken up on both mornings of our stay by people going up and down the wooden stairs that backed onto our room there was no milk in the room just coffee whitener yet there was a small fridge water ran down the shower frame onto the floor by the toilet every time a shower was taken the restaurant was under renovation so building work started from am i repeat we had such poor sleep
