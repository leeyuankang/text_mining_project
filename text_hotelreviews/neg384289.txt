ok for starters the pictures and review made us believe this hotel was a lot nicer that it actually was from the moment we got in we realised it is an aged hotel very small lobby with two very slow lifts that brought us up too a lovely room with twin beds as apposed too a double bed the biggest problem we had was how terrible the beds actually were extremely uncomfortable i would not go back
