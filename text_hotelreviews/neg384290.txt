the room we had was down very narrow steep stairs although our cases were brought to the room when we arrived we had to bring them back up on departure i am glad we only had small bags we would have struggled getting larger cases up the staircase no good for any larger people either the room was small and cramped and if was difficult to move round the beds as the space was that limited the mini fridge was warm so we couldn t use that the bathroom was much colder than the fridge and there was no heating in there the toiletries weren t great it would be nicer having seperate shower gel to shampoo etc power shower was excellent though
