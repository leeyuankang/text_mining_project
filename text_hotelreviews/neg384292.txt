hotel is very dated inside guests are made to sign a form upon arrival to say they will not smoke however there are outdoor stairways within the hotel where people smoke meaning the smell travels into rooms whilst exiting our room one morning and walking up the outdoor spiral staircase from the ground floor we thought it was snowing in actual fact it was just fag ash from the person smoking on the next floor lovely bathroom was very old grout yellow and unclean no fan so room smelt quite damp definitely doesn t feel like a hotel
