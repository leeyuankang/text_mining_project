room was pleasant enough but the bed was really too large for the room it was difficult to move between the sides of the bed and the wall furthermore there were two simple chairs meant for working at the desk or i suppose watching television they must be amongst the least comfortable chairs i ve ever had to sit on had i been staying longer i would have asked the front desk to find me something more suitable and i m sure they would have i was annoyed that breakfast in the hotel cost i didn t take it for this reason that s simply far more than i pay for breakfast
