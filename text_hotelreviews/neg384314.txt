normal rooms are old and cramped common areas look old and beaten all walls and furniture needing refurbishment walls are super thin and you can hear the noise coming from mostly everywhere and i am not even a light sleeper i heard the noise of people talking in plain voice two bedrooms away from mine so if you are a light sleeper this is hell reception area is just plain unwelcoming like nonexistent it is hard to read this is supposed to be a star hotel i would give it max a star in a great location i simply do not understand how with such a great location occupancy and charging such high rates there is simply no investment in making this a cosier nicer looking and more comfortable hotel to guest there is even a door signage that says needs repairing for you to hang on your wall need i say more plus the night shift staff member who talked to me on the day i could not sleep because of the noise was not very welcoming
