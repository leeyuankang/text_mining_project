shower was configured horribly it was uncomfortable and small and the water would leak into the floor water pressure was also poor bathroom products were cheap they had the all in one shower gel shampoo and conditioner no mini bar actually there was one it was just empty dirty in side bed had a thin foam thing on top of the mattress which the sheets were tucked into this meant the sheets were never right and came out when you were sleeping it felt like bathing with your socks on curtain had rips all the way through you didn t notice this until the morning when the light came through
