the room although superior was only superior in size the other rooms seemed quite small it was at the back but was very noisy bring ear plugs there was tea coffee making facilities in the room but no extras for a superior room the room wasn t very clean on arrival with bits of paper on the floor the bathroom floor and buttons for flushing the toilet were not cleaned once during our stay there are memory foam toppers on the bed which are tired with dips in the middle as these toppers make you feel hot i m not sure how hygienic they are i wouldn t rate the hotel as very clean the staff were disinterested and not very friendly i would say the hotel was over staffed breakfast was not included and we had the city tax added on arrival so it worked out quite expensive for what we got the breakfast was fine but it isn t advertised that you can have alternatives like omelettes poached eggs etc we paid a reduced rate but it would be very expensive at full price otherwise we didn t eat in the restaurant but it was empty every night which speaks volumes the hotel is very central but i would not recommend this hotel
