had to insist on moving rooms as room was dirty e g mould on walls and shower curtain the final room was just about acceptable but did not deserve a star rating and was very overpriced there was no water in the room no mini bar only plastic cups very cheap toilet paper as we paid a night this is disgraceful we stay in amsterdam on business every years and book about rooms we will not be using this hotel again
