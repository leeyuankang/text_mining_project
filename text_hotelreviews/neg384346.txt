firstly the check in process was a hassle impolitely they have accused me for not having my card i paid with and said i must have it and if not i might be kicked out of the hotel even though i paid i promised them to get a copy of it by morning time rude act was that after i have entered my room exhausted of my hours flight i hear a knock on the door i immediately open and i see the hotel people that claim that the room i have entered is not the correct one and i was moved around like rubbish wandering at bed time the worst part is ahead in the morning i had to catch a flight and i ordered a hotel shuttle to take me to the airport hours prior my flight at around when my flight is at and the drive to the airport takes minutes the receptionist let me know that there is a thing called city tax i did not have a problem to pay the euros it costs but i did not have euros on me but only australian dollars i was asking them for a solution or perhaps a close by exchange store for me to have some euros i was forced to go minutes to the central train station by myself with a promise that this is the only exchange store that was open my only request was to delay the shuttle in minutes thought hours prior an international flight is also fine surprisingly not only that the store was closed and i just wasted minutes i also missed the shuttle and they did not take care of that so i was still stuck in the hotel without my shuttle to the airport hours before my flight at this point i started to show some anger it was sorted when they said i can give them aud and in exchange i will get the same value in euros i was angry because this could be done before and save me the euros i had to pay for the taxi after i wastefully paid euros for the hotel shuttle just a horrible experience please do not do that to yourselves
