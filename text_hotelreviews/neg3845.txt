sink in bathroom extremely small we were asked for our champagne to room and didnt appear so had to get on check out also found it very disappointing to be asked to pay for room service on the spot and not able to put on room bill we were very offended by this we have stayed in hotels all over the world and never been asked to do this before in fact had returned from a wonderful holiday in hong kong just the week before and had room service and paid on check out would appreciate some feed back on this matter
