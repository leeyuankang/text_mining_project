of us arrived early in the morning we were happy to wait around the corner in the lounge while people checked out but were not impressed when we found others lined up behind us had checked in before us on the plus side we were very grateful for the early check in and the extra we paid to not have to wait for one did give us a room we were very happy with breakfast was a little costly we found a lovely cafe on a nearby corner that provided a tasty and healthy alternative many cafes do not open for breakfast early one told us
