the air conditioning didn t go cold enough so the room was quite stuffy which meant we had to open the window this unfortunately meant u heard the noise from the street in the night we did ask the hotel re this they said there is an eco system in the hotel which controls the temperature the bathroom in our room was quite open so you will need to be comfortable with your travel partner the other room in our party had more privacy so if this is a problem for you make this request when you book i would still definitely stay here again though very cool funky
