disappointed there was no bath in the room gym it was a disgrace to even call it that it had a rower bike and cross trainer and no treadmill very poor i just don t think that the hotel represented value for money we paid euros for nights monday tuesday with no breakfast included i expected more from the hotel in terms of fitness facilities and the size of the room and to have a bath included had the room been significantly cheaper then i wouldn t have been as harsh in my critique
