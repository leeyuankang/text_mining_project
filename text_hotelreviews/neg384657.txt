when we arrived it was around in the morning we hadn t slept in almost hours so we couldn t wait for our bed we were told our room was ready so we rushed upstairs to hop in to our disappointment when we opened the door our room hadn t been attended to since the previous guests used bed sheets and towels and rubbish it was quite a disappointment we went back downstairs and brought it to the attention of one of the younger male staff members but he didn t take much interest he just asked did we want our bags taken for a while we told him we saw the cleaners on our floor so we ll come back in an hour we arrived back about an hour and a half later and went up to our room and there was stil no joy nobody had cleaned it i was more upset at this point as i felt nobody cared about us so we went downstairs and brought it to the attention of a different lady who was extremely helpful and apologetic and tried everything she could to get us a room sadly there was none available so we had to leave for another hour and come back when we came back an hour later our room was finally real dy we were never so happy to see our bed they were very apologetic and advised this never happens and i understand mistakes happen but i was shocked they didn t offer an apology gesture or something they didn t seem to care very much once we had our room in order it was just bad start to the trip because we were so tired but it was absolutely beautiful and amazing after that
