check in was disappointing we were basically given our room keys and told to park the car it is best to do this first as it is not possible to stop close to the hotel other guests who were dealt with by a different member of staff seemed to be given more time however i did witness staff explaining the hotel etc and showing maps of the local area whereas for some reason we weren t even told the times for breakfast we had to queue for half an hour for the car park our rooms were ok we paid for the better room whilst the girls had a classic room the rooms are very small and the most annoying part is that there wasn t anywhere to put your belongings which couldn t be hung in the closet we had a sofa but couldn t use it as the bed was right in front the toilet and shower are frosted glass and right next to each other the floor is quite dangerous when wet i slipped twice the fridge in the room is within the drawers of the desk and is incredibly noisy so we kept it turned off regrettably it was not replenished either we ate in the hotel once in the evening the food was very good and the staff were lovely breakfast is a but of a free for all i was not offered a hot drink on any of the three mornings overall this is an ok hotel at best the corridors were quite worn and it certainly wasn t the cleanest hotel we have stayed in it s really a glorified express hotel we had also requested quiet rooms but were woken every morning at by noise from the alley way downstairs
