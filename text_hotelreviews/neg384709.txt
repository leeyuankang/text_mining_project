was so annoyed about the breakfast bento box we ordered description stated sausage and bacon but we received mushroom and bacon which wasn t even on the menu and i am allergic to mushrooms well wasted on breakfast the hotel also took extra money out of my bank account as security which would ve been fine if they didn t do it without telling me
