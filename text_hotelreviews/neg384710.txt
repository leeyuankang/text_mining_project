sadly room is looking out into the gap between buildings without daylight facing a dirty wall and the neighbors windows at away rooms like this cannot demand the premium price i paid they should be listed as special offers due to their handicap and be clearly called out in the booking options it s common practice elsewhere to have a higher rate for ocean view vs city view there should be a no view bargain offer also the hotel could work with its brilliant designers architects to find a creative solution a coat of white paint on the neighboring building for example to compensate brighten the outlook from the rooms on this side of the building clean bright curtains would help too the ones in room were grey and had not been cleaned in a while to sum it up my experience was considerably impacted by the absence of daylight and the view into a dirty dark creepy crevasse with so much effort spent on the overall design this was a real let down
