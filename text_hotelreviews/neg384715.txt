the photos shown at info of the hotel are deceptive the hotel rooms were way tinier than the pics shown we couldnt even put our luggages and bags to a proper place the restroom and the shower have no sense of privacy which would make it extremely difficult for newlyweds and couples room service is incapable of carrying out even the most simplest orders we asked for a fresh fruit in the evening and couldnt get any because the guy at the reception told us that the chef in kitchen cant prepare a fruit plate the rooms are very claustrophobic the reception who is also responsible for concierge and guest relations made us felt like they would only recommend the restaurants that they would make a commission it wasnt worth the money at all never again
