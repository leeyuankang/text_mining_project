we booked a luxury room with king size bed but the size of room is very limited so that we could not open the big luggage properly it is far from my understanding of luxury room the glass partition for bathtub doesn t work functionally which is too short to block the water coming out so the part of bathroom is easily wet i think it is not a good solution as we shall find the balance between art and feasible solution
