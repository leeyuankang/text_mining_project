very small bedroom room no storage so little space the safe was in the bathroom it was ok for one person but very tight for two we requested a bath instead of shower when we booked several months in advance no one got back to us to tell us there were only baths in the executive rooms and extra euros a night housekeeping poor the bathroom door which was about twelve inches away from the bed squeaked so loudly we had to ask for it to be oiled within minutes of arriving which was done quickly we had t ask for facecloths and shampoo which were not replaced after the first night the shelf in the shower meant for toiletries was at such an angle it was impossible to use we stayed at this hotel when it was the convent it has undergone a major refurbishment and is now very minimalist and trendy and obviously geared towards business people we would not go back we did not think it was good value
