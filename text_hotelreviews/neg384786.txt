staff are not so compatiable when i raised a question on bills they can only come back with a reason on the overcharged after over half an hour most of the conversation between the two staff serving us are conducted in dutch we led us to think that they did not want us to know what were the conversation eventually that billing problem was resolved but it took an hour to rectify that when we queued to check in it took us more than minutes though we were only second to the guest being served the staff apparently were not focused rooms are quite small though clean i think the room is not large enough for two guests to stay at the same time
