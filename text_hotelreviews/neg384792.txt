the hotel was nice my only complaint was that our room was not availailbe for us to check in until after pm since our flight arrived early we had our luggage held since that morning and came back in the afternoon there should have been no reason for our room not to be ready by check in time pm also note if you are not traveling with someone very close to you the bathroom did not have a separate door to provide privacy for showering open to room area
