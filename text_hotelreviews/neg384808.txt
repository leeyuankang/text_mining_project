we had booked a double room and based on the booking com website the size of the room was given as approximately sq metres it was nowhere near that large we had large suitcases because we were catching a cruise ship and we had nowhere to put them we felt very cramped our fellow travellers had booked at the same time as us the same type of room and theirs was a decent size
