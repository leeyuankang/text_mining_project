we arrived minutes before check in time and was told the room wasn t ready so we could hang in the bar and have a drink while we wait minutes later i checked on the room status and was told it was still not ready another minutes later we decided to leave our bags and walk the city but when we went to the front desk to give them our bags suddenly our room was ready this was over hours late pr and people had been checking in while we were waiting then the room was small which is fine but the bathroom was right next to the bed and had a frosted glass door that didn t close all the way so privacy was terrible i was disappointed because i was really excited to stay here just got off on the wrong foot and didn t get any better
