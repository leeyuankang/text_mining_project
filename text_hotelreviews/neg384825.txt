there was work being carried out in the bar downstairs which created some noise early in the morning the fire alarm was also going off when we arrived which meant a fire curtain was down over the lift door on our floor and we couldn t get out we went back down to reception for assistance and were told this would be fixed we got back in the lift and the fire curtain was still down so we had to walk up the stairs with all our luggage
