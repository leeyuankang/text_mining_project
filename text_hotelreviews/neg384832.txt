really noisy thumping music until way beyond considerable street noise and smell of dope in the room room had one of these awful glass walled toilets meaning you had zero privacy from your room mate at the times you need it most breakfast was ok but not great basically a small selection of sausage scrambled egg roast cherry tomato and potato plus assorted croissants yoghurts they also were very busy and we had to wait minutes to get a table certainly not worth euro per person per day overall a real and genuine disappointment considering we spent something like euro on two nights here dont repeat our mistake
