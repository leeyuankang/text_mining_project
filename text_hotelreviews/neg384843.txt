we arrived early a desk staff told us they could upgrade us to a bigger suite as our room wasn t ready we booked an executive twin anyway it would cost an extra per night for nights i checked their www we had a smaller room than we booked complaining a staff member showed what our suite should of been much larger so we didn t pay the extra he was saying that to everyone that came in early not a good practice
