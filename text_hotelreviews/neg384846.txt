two things the shower floor is very slippery and to overcome this problem i used a towel on the floor also no grab handles which for older persons is almost a necessity you may not be aware but the bright green aclights which cast a shadow during the nights disturbed me as i m not used to a c and sleep with open windows summer and winter which is easier in melbourne as we do not get the cold winters you do so that maybe a personal problem worth noting
