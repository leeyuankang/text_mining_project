on the last night before flight home there was party downstairs and we were invited to this function but with a young son it was not appropriate however the dj music was so loud that me and my son did not sleep until and had to be up at for flight home although we did not attend the party it felt like we were there with our hotel room vibrating i did complain along with other guests and the music eventually switched off at with no compensation for this in convenience if i wanted a club night i would have gone out
