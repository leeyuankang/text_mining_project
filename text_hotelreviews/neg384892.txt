there were a few disappointing aspects firstly the view or lack there of the only view was of a wall of the back of a building a couple of metres away which actually made the room rather dark this was an unpleasant surprise as i d paid extra for a superior double presuming that would increase the chances of a better view and i had requested if possible a view upon booking secondly at breakfast there were a number of issues both days we had to wait a while to be seated as there was not enough room we were not told about breakfast finishing early on the sunday due to an event in the hotel luckily we arrived half an hour before breakfast was due to finish however it appeared the hotel staff were clearly prioritising the event over their clientele as staff cleared most of the pastries and all of the juices away half an hour before breakfast was due to finish in order to get ready for the event so we missed out on some items i noticed some dinners missed out on hot food altogether also getting a cup of coffee is quite difficult at breakfast time dirty coffee cups were also left in our room after the first day and the air conditioning did not seem to work well so there were a few niggles which were disappointing for the price but we have great memories of our time here
