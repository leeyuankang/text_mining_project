the bad if you re a family with baby ies there is little infrastructure in place for them we were pretty much forced to move to a more expensive room at check in so a hotel provided crib could fit the crib was not very child friendly several plastic pointy edges and the hotel did not have baby seats at their restaurant elevators were small and slow eventually one of the only two of them they had broke down so it made things even slower at some points in the day check in and check out there was a cue for the elevators the hotel room was nice but it was more focused on being hip than it was on providing comfort at a point it became full of little nuisances that made it a bit less of a great experience it is still a very good place to stay and good value for your money
