i booked the room with breakfast but when i checked in there is no breakfast inclusive this is still fine until the hotel charged different amount from what i booked thru booking com i sent a complain letter to the hotel the response was very unfair please double check what you booked and what you get overthere they did not clean the coffee mugs and glasses for days the tea selection was empty i asked for a refill but never come the room was not the same with the pictures in booking com it was much more smaller and bad ugly view
