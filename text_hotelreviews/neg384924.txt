we was put at the back on our own out of the way i tried to settle the bill upon arrival i was told it was hotel policy to take payment on checkout the next day i was told i had to pay straight away this was i did not feel comfortable taking that amount of money from the machine in the evening so i waited until the next day however staff stopped our room key from working so we had to pay was made to feel like we was not posh enough to stay at this hotel bad experience
