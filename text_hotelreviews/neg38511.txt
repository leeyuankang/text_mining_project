we booked the room on behalf of our colleague because it was a retirement gift from the company i booked the room at the end of april using a business credit card which was then shown on my boss s statement that payment had gone through as we knew it would because it was a non transferable no cancellation booking i even called the hotel at the time and they said the payment will go through within the next couple of days there was no mention when booking with youselves that it was the policy of the hotel that you still have to produce the credit card even though it was already paid for on mr simons arrival which was supposed to be a relaxing time was asked to produce the card and was advised from the management that they couldn t except the payment for his booking without the card even though it was paid by our company how ridiculous he then had to pay for the already paid room from his own money and was given a refund statement for the other payment this whole situation is extremely disappointing unnecessary and an embarrassment for our colleague
