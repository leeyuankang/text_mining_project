the breakfast overall was very disappointing the bacon was streaky bacon never been served that in a hotel before scrambled egg did not look like scrambled egg the toaster took ages to brown the bread my husband had the cooked breakfast but i had a continental which was ok certainly not worth each though the tables in the breakfast room were far too close to one another and one morning we were seated on bench seating very close to others which made it difficult to move in and out our room was very small and overlooked a back yard area which had some rather noisy venting system although it did not disturb us too much during the night
