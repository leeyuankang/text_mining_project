the reception staff are really friendly but they made a mistake with my room giving me a room that two other arriving guests had been given this is really something that should be avoided i did get a free breakfast to compensate for it the other staff can be quite noisy once when i was walking down the stairs one staff member had to say sssssshhhh really loudly when he saw me coming to get them to stop yelling
