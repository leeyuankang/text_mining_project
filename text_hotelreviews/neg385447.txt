the hotel seemed to be two buildings which were connected by a walkway at first floor level the narrow lane between the buildings which i have no idea where it led to was very noisy at times with people passing along it sometimes in the early hours who were shouting and yelling one night it seemed as if large wheelie bins were being moved to be emptied but the noise of them going along the narrow lane was awful when you are trying to sleep there appeared to be no air conditioning that i was aware of which meant having the window open which did not help with the comings and goings in the lane
