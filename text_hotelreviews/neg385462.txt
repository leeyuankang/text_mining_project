we were charged deposit when we got to their hotel i asked for them to empty the fridge rather than pay as it did not state on my receipt or email even after speaking to the manager they refused to take the off i ve been to many hotels and if you do not wish to pay they just remove the contents of the fridge because of this we were unable to go out on the last night of my birthday weekend it ruined it as they didn t care that it was not stated anywhere in my email or app confirmation i would have prepared if it was stated before
