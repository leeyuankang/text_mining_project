the room was rather small and didn t easily collate with rooms shown on the hotel web site reception staff recommended restaurants on different evenings the first was an italian restaurant and was excellent but the second which was adjacent to the hotel was poor because of poor service and an over cooked meal finally whilst we enjoyed the breakfast and its range of food as a vegetarian i would have appreciated vegetarian sausages and other vegetarian options
