our amsterdam experience was ruined by the ridiculous booking policy of taking secured pre payment having booked rooms for three nights the hotel actually secured first night costs one week before the stay x why for rooms when asking the manager the answer was no idea however it got worse on check in they then secured the full three nights cost from my accounts not just the remaining so effectively they secured night stay for nights just over from my account against a stay that cost that was our spending money so imagine being in the most expensive european city with a chunk of our own money that we cannot access we ask the hotel to remove and they just paid lip service to us several times they were asled yo sort out even the duty manager was asked but we got no help unfortunately even now back from the holiday the secured money is still not cleared i would suggest avoiding this hotel like the plague ive travelled the world and never experienced such incompetence
