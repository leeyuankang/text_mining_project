rooms are somewhat worn furnishings could use some updating bathroom is very small cleanliness is quite substandard indeed as i found peanuts on the carpet floor which must have come from an earlier guest i do not want to speculate on how long it has been there and quite some dust as well showerhead was adorned with some long hairs for a hotel that charges quite steep prices this is quite unacceptable indeed
