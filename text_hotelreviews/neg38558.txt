the room service cooked breakfast that we payed each extra for was of much poorer quality than the breakfast that we had on the second morning in the breakfast room it was quite dry and came with salad although the hr bar was a good idea as mentioned above in reality we had to wait a long time for someone to appear and when they did the service was pretty brusque the drink prices were also very high though i suppose that is london for you
