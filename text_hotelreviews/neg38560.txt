my single room was over hot i turned heating down on arrival and kept window open all night the sound proofing above room not brilliant as could hear guests flushing etc but they were quiet at night and the rest of the hotel was very hushed i d request top floor in future there are lifts kept tripping over plinth between bed and bath a potential hazard it was also a shame nearest tube closed but bus stops close by so easy and regular access to oxford street via or could also walk to nottinghill
