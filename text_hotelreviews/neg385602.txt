i booked an executive double room and was giving a standard double room the room was old and over used aircondition was not working properly contacted the women in the front disk to fix the problem but they were not able to do so and they didn t want to change the room instead they brought a fan but the gentlemen in the front desk working at night changed my room to an executive double room
