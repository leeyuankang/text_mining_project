the hotel is always busy i guess thanks to its location so there is almost always a queue at check ins and check outs breakfasts are okay but not excellent as i saw in some reviews here i got a double bed even though i booked a twin one but it was actually two shifted beds with one mattress the mattress was not comfy at all when you turn in bed it makes your partner jump on the other side of the bed or the other way round the room is not so spotless as expected couple of strangers hair here and there and under the nightstand i found pits of cherries with layer of dust
