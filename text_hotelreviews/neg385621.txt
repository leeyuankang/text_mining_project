the beds are very uncomfortable mattress are not secured and as you move around on the bed or when getting into bed the mattress moves this prevented us having a good night sleep as you were frightened to move my husband actually moved near the edge of the bed and the mattress tipped up he was lucky not to fall on the floor something needs to be done to secure this issue
