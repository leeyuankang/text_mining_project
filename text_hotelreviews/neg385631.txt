our hotel room was dirty and smelt of smoke we also found hairs in the bathroom when we raised this as an issue with the staff we were told that there is nothing they could do to help and refused to switch rooms for us i felt it was very expensive for the quality of the room we were given staff were friendly until we said there was a problem i would give a lower rating if possible but they did have free wifi would avoid if possible
