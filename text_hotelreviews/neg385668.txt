that we had to ring the morning of checking out to find out if we could get a late one or not and after paying that amount i thought it was quite unfair that we could not get one should be allowed to check the night before instead of the morning of as we wanted to get a good night sleep before travelling again sadly once we woke to see if we could get one we could not get back to sleep and were exhausted on arrival home
