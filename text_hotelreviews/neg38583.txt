our room was absolutely tiny which was super disappointing considering i had booked an executive double room months in advanced and it was still for nights ideal only for business transit solo guests the staff need to work on their customer service and demeanour they come across really rude and annoyed when dealing with guests which can be quite upsetting for tourists
