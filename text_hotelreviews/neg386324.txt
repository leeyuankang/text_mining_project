there are about balconies in a row with a view of tower bridge but they need some true privacy dividers rather then just the planter that currently keeps them separate it was awkward when guests on either side were either out in their robes or when they were smoking also the way out to the balcony is a large door sized window unfortunately we had to keep it open in order to hear our son and be sure he was sleeping the wind caught the window a lot and since there s no way to secure it my husband got nailed with it in the arm several times a little resistance added to the window that s usable from the outside would be great
