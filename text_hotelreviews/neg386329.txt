i had to be picky to find fault they had great blackout curtains but the glass door to the bathroom let in light to pull down the blind in the bathroom necessitated climbing in the bath unless i was missing something the bed was on small legs so i think things could roll under maybe why i found a crisp package not ours underneath missed by cleaners this is not a con for us but be warned there is not much in the area at night or weekends if you like buzz
