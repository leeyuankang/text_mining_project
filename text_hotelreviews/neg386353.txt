the establishment seems to have an old wing and a new one while the price is the same the rooms are not of the same size and comfort we had to ask to change the rooms which the receptionist gladly helped us with the pillows are not that comfortable too soft and the shower ventilation was full of dust and didn t seem to work properly anymore other than these few details our stay was great
