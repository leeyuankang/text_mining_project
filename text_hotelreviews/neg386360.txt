the breakfast was dreadful the staff didn t understand our requests we had to wait ages and still didn t get what we had asked for all with a smile this doesn t make up for cold eggs and no toast i was also allotted a room in the new building with out warning and without the receptionists discovering that i could not walk as far or negotiate steps this was rectified immediately but it was quite upsetting nevertheless
