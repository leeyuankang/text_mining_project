i ve been offered basement room at first no window just a small opening on the ceiling which lets no light in smells terribly noisy air conditioning klostrophobic these rooms shouldn t be used as guest rooms considering the per night price tag good thing is that the night manager was able to accommodate me in another room which was the last available room and way decent then the basement one i m afraid i may not choice this hotel again just because of the risk i may be given the basement room and without an option to change it next time
