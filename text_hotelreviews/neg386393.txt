the room and bathroom were very cold turning up the ac to higher temperature didn t help much not at all in the bathroom it was probably our last time in that hotel for that reason i was uncomfortable taking a shower it was so cold the lobby has nice couches to sit on and enjoy a drink but no music in the evening makes it feel dull and cold
