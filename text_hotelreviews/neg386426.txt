our stay was the first weekend in december i chose this hotel for it s location and the review scores i expected and paid for a king sized bed but it was just a normal double i did query this with the staff but they were adamant that it was a king sized bed it was the smallest king sized bed i ve ever slept in the lounge area in the hotel wasn t particularly comfortable or welcoming it was more reminiscent of a waiting area than a lounge the seating was awful massive cushioned seats great if you re really tall with no proper backs to them just a wall and a small cushion to rest back on or padded stools to sit on we just wanted to sit and chat with a drink for a couple of hours after a shopping expedition the service in the restaurant especially for drinks was exceptionally slow even though the restaurant wasn t particularly busy at that point i would have expected an a la carte menu in the restaurant but we were told we had the fixed price festive menu to choose off and it would remain so until christmas the food however was very well cooked the whole place was a tad lack lustre but it didn t ruin a fabulous weekend there are many hotels in this area of london and we will choose a different one next time
