the staff of the restaurant is bad as there is no system in place it seems for taking orders and serving the meals my dinner was served too cold and i had to send it back when it finally came back my girlfriend finished hers and my side dishes were not reheated they had forgotten this even though they took it to reheat so i had to eat alone the breakfast the morning after had pieces of plastic in the food and again my girlfriend and i were therefore eating apart from each other something is really off in this restaurant even though we got a apologies this experience really spoiled it for us and we would not go back to the apex hotels again as it seems to be a trend in not being able to deliver a good experience plenty of hotels in london which can do better
