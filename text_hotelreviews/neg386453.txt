we only had breakfast no other meals but the food quality was awful and overpriced the pancakes were dry the crispy american style bacon was not in the slightest bit crispy and the substitution for parts of the full english breakfast didn t even come we also had to ask twice again for the toast we had ordered definitely not worth the high price and although we would definitely stay here again we d go for breakfast somewhere else
