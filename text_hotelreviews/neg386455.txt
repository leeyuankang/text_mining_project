our son had an accident as small kids sometimes do an peed the bed overnight the hotel was prepared with a barrier sheet installed but they put the dirty sheets back on the bed after we stripped them off in the end i think it was a communication problem and it was promptly and courteously resolved they also took advantage of our request for extending our stay by offering a significantly higher rate however they did reduce the cost and i am confident all other hotels in the popular area would do the same
