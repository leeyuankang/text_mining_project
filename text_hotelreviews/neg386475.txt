pillows were awful and so soft the kids and our heads fell right through to the bed underneath some staff were good but i found a couple of them to be very alouf rather than happy and helpful a smile goes a long way and some of the staff mainly the male ones to the honest could do with a slap with a happy stick the room whilst on the top floor was incredibly noisy you could hear every single drunk person early hours of the morning as though they were in our room and the smashing of bottles from the bins being loaded from various pubs and hotels around was so loud it woke us all at midnight and the early hours of the morning also a lot of construction going on around the hotel so if you want complete peace this is not the place they really needed to double glaze the windows and the seals better for an inner city hotel
