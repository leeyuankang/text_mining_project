the pillows were not great one was slightly bigger than the other but when you put your head down they went completely flat and both my partner and i found them very uncomfortable and it made it hard to sleep also the bed could have done with a proper duvet cover as it made the bed cold as it was very thin we weren t also informed on our arrival that the bathroom had disabled facilities this may be that all the standard rooms have these facilities at the hotel which is great but it would have been nice to be informed of this either when booking or on arrival and given the option of a different room if applicable as we felt a bit guilty occupying this room when we didn t need such facilities
