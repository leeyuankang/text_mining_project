the room we had to move room times for the nights we were there and the last room we were moved to was extremely small the first nights we were in a small room later in they move us to a room in an executive floor the room is times larger and is considered a suite although that size of that room would be considered a standard size in the us after spending nights in the larger room the plumbing on the entire floor didn t work and it discharged a very unpleasant smell in to the rooms again had to move to another room that s even smaller than the first one you can only get on the bed from one side to open the window you have to get on the bed and you can t open your luggage unless it s laid on the bed but we managed the staff since many of the staff if not all are not british native most are from eastern europe reception wasn t warm they re cold but professional except for one tall young man i think his name is michael whose customer service skill is of those starwood hotels level second to none we re very appreciative of everything he did for us
