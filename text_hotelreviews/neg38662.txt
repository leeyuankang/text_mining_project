first room room tiny room just enough room for double bed pushed against wall window with one bedside table no prob as i was on my own but tv positioned sideways so you could not watch it from the bed and i did not want to sit in a chair in front of tv coffee maker was in cupboard the electric lead could not be plugged in to use on top of the table so only way to use was to crouch down on floor and potentially destroy thje cupboard with humidity solution make guests aware this is a small room suited to one person or cozy for and add more plugs and reposition ttv simple staff were helpful and moved me but only late in evening when they knew what inventory was left room much better thank you
