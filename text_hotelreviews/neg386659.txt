the room had no natural light and on booking i requested a view the receptionist was very unhelpful when i queried this saying it is a city twin what did i expect we were then woken by loud hammering on the door at by a drunken guest who had been in the hotel bar drinking all night the cooked breakfasts were very slow and sub standard we also had a lengthy booking our process as we were invoiced for the breakfast but this was include in the room rate i showed her the confirmation with it clearly written and after several phone calls they finally believed me and agreed to take it off all in all very embarrassing and disappointing
