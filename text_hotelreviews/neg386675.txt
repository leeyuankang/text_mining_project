the buffet breakfast was a big let down specailly after reading a number of positive reviews on the net if you opt for inclusive of breakfast room rate the breakfast cost is included in your room rent and the cost is quite high but the breakfast choice is very limited with just a few breads and croisants and a couple of other items you are also handed a printed menu which consists of all the things which you really want to eat like a hot omelette etc but you have to pay extra for these the supervisory staff at the breakfast section seriously needs some training in being friendly and welcoming guests may be some staff from the reception area should be shifted here a colleague who was with me had booked a room for a week through booking com and had booked the breakfast too due to some error by the booking com site this was not communicated to the hotel while having his breakfast he was interrupted by the staff thrice to discuss the matter which i found hightly embarrassing
