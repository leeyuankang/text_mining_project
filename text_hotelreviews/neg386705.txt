we were given a basement room despite requesting a room higher up with a view the room which while was comfortable clean spacious and quiet still felt very detached from the rest of the hotel importantly there was a need to get a lift which was always busy just to get from reception to the basement one level there were no stairs which raised a question of evacuation in the event of a fire
