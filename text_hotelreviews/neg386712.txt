we ate four times in the restaurant and literally every piece of meat we both had was overcooked even the kippers a kipper is hot smoked and so already cooked it does not need to be grilled to within an inch of becoming a crisp in order to prepare it i did get the cost of my kipper deducted from my bill but i would have preferred a moist tasty kipper for my breakfast during our stay we also had the turkey escalope rib eye steak and barnsley lamb chop all of these were seriously over cooked leaving them tough and dry the starters and deserts we tried were good but rather lacking in imagination with very little variety from the deserts in all what i am saying is that the hotel and its staff at front of house were good and very enjoyable but if we had stayed more than two nights i definitely would not have dinned in the restaurant again
