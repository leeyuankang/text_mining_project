hotel has clearly done a deal with golden tours bus tours we asked the concierge if he could recommend us a good bus tour he sold us tickets for the golden tours busses the tour was abysmal and not worth the time or money we spent on it breakfast was poor just a buffet food was a bit cold luckily we hadn t had to pay for breakfast bc the hotel had made a mistake with our room so they gave us free breakfast in return but if we had paid i d have been complaining about the breakfast to the staff in charge
