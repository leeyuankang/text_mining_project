next to the hotel there is an empty building for many years which is absolutely disgusting and all the dust and horrible smell comes to the hotel rooms i am pretty sure they are rats everywhere and i don t understand how this hotel is rated with stars and best western agrees to give their franchise to such a horrible hotel they have the ventilation on to absorb the bad smell with the result of creating massive noise during the day and night
