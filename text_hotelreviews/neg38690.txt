the reception staff needs to learn about service not very nice service the rooms are very different in size and the beds are not large beds as stated they are cm max in all double rooms only family rooms have cm we first got a room next to the elevator was so small that we could not get suitcases in there we got another one which was okay our friends got a room with a view to the garbage shaft where the noise started at o clock in the morning they were moved finally to a nice room on the floor so beware to ask for a bigger or nicer room some of the rooms should be discounted in price
