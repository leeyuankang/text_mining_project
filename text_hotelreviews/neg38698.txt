if one had to quibble the room was really small and the wardrobe was mostly taken up by the ironing board and by a large safe large enough for a notebook i couldn t even unpack a small suitcase this will be a problem for anyone staying for more than a night or two the neighbouring building is in a state of decay and it is a bit of a shocker but this has nothing to do with the mornington and renovations now seem to be getting under way there
