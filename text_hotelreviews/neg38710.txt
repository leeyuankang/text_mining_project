the room is super small it s difficult to open our luggage in the room the double bed is super small for two people the ventilation in the toilet is extremely poor the toilet smell was disgusting when we first entered the room there was no ventilation in the toilet although the staff claimed that there s an automatic one not an electric one but i really don t think there s i was glad that i only had to stay there for one night definitely not value for money
