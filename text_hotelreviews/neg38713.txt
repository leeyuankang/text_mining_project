when we first arrived at the hotel we were greeted by a receptionist who wasn t very pleasant at all we had asked to check in from but she rudely told us that we were too early and that our room would not be ready until which was fine but overall the staff hadn t got very good communication skills and i feel it took the good out of the hotel
