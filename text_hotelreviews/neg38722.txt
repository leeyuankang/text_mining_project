there were ants on the second floor in my room in the bathroom so i had to ask reception to offer me another room at first they just called cleaning staff to wash the bathroom but the problem was not solved i insisted on a room change so i was given a very cosy room on the floor with no problems at all on the whole i am satisfied with my stay
