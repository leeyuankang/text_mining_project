the size of the room was far too small the double bed was wedged in an alcove could only get in on one side not able to use chair for desk only stayed one night so not a problem for us bathroom too small it was as if the room was chopped in half or even a third we stayed one night only should we have stayed longer we would have asked to change rooms
