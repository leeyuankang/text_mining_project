the breakfast was quite poor and we had issues on checkout where they wanted to charged us for additional breakfast this is a combination of an issue with booking com making a reservation for people when apparently only people were entitled to breakfast but also the hotels fault for not informing prior to us having breakfast and taking money from my account with no prior authorization i have also been charged twice for one of the breakfasts but still no refund has been given the staff at reception were not very helpful and refused to try and speed up the process given we were late for our flight a really poor way to end a special family trip for my sisters birthday
