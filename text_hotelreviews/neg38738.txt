it was a little noisy with doors banging and echoing through the property but when i requested a quieter room hotel staff obliged there is no restaurant in the hotel apart from breakfast room but that is all that is really necessary when you are in london with so many good places to eat around it s a shame the outside of the property is not as nice as the inside and that next door the building is in a very dilapidated state however the area is a safe one to stay in and walk around at night
