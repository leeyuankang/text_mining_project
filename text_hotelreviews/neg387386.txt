not so much a negative but on check in they were falling over themselves to tell us how we had a complimentary mini bar and a nespresso machine which would be restocked daily the nespresso machine came with capsules not restocked for night and the mini bar had cans of pepsi an orange juice two waters and one heineken also not restocked for night it wasn t expected so if they hadn t made a big deal i wouldn t have cared but beer for two people seemed a little stingy we didn t mention this to them and again not so exactly a negative but they didn t really manage our expectations well
