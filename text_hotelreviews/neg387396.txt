room very small nothing like expectations from the picture about either side of the bed but one side was under the eves so you had to duck and shuffle along to get in the bed bed was like a plank of wood extremely firm room was noisy as it was right opposite the lift so could hear it clanking and groaning all night may have been more obvious because of not being able to sleep because of the bed rooms very hot in the day and very cold overnight heating seemed to go off around and come back on full force about did not have breakfast because even with the discount offered on arrival it was still very overpriced
