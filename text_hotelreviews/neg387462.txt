we had booked and paid for a double room but on arrival were told that there had been a technical problem and so we were given a very small double room for our first night we assume that it was in fact a single room which had been given a small double bed we had to get out of bed to turn off the room light there was no bedside light we were moved to the booked double room on the following day as compensation we were eventually given a complimentary drink each and a free breakfast for one morning
