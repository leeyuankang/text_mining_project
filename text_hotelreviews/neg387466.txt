our free mini bar in our room supplied us with chocolate toblerone and pringles we came back late and were hungry so we decided to have them as a snack only to find they were gone we can only assume a member of staff from the hotel entered our room when we were out and took the toblerone and pringles this really annoyed us on principal and the fact we had only just left a coffee shop and started to really get hunger pangs if you know what i mean we don t expect to have things taken form our room when we are not there also we were late risers and didn t leave the hotel to around half each day the chamber maids said they would come later to empty our bin and give fresh towels this did not happen maybe they were too busy stealing our pringles and toblerone
