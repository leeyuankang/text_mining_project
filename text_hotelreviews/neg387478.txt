the room was on the top third floor and due to a sloping roof the wall overhung the bed this meant we had to be careful not to knock our heads in addition the air conditioning didn t work very well so our sleep was disturbed due to the heat in the room so avoid the third floor and check the air conditioning before accepting the room the room we had was poor value
