entry is up about steep outside steps which is difficult with a large suitcase and unaided i dealt with three different women at the front desk between my arrival and late departure the next day i sensed that although friendly all could use more training in both knowledge of the area and hospitality the bathroom could definitely use a safety bar in the shower it is only a minute walk to paddington station for the heathrow express very convenient however this is a bit of a challenge in the rain and pulling a large case taxis from the hotel charge a hefty price because the station is so close so it is better to walk
