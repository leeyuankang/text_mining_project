thought the safety deposit box held at reception a bit expensive especially if you are staying more than a few days really missed not having a safe in the room bit disappointed with the location of our room window was opaqued as looked onto the marble stair well had to ask for it to be opened closed noises at night if left open as sound travels up the marble stair way when people are coming in in very jolly moods room could have done with a main light as it was a bit dim with just the small bedside wall lights so not having an outside window made this worse
