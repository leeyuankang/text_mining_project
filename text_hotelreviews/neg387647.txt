they lied in there advert they say they have air conditioning which was my only criteria when booking and when we got there it was not there apparently it s seasonal and they only turn it on for a small part of the year reguardless of whether it s hot or not they offered no refund or even part refund when i questioned the desk i was told there was no one there who could deal with it and the manager wasn t going to be in until the day we left and there was nothing they could do this is supposed to be surely there should be someone who can deal with your problems especially at a weekend they say they have double beds but their idea of a double bed is singles pushed together which resulted in me or my partner falling into the gap each night when the beds split apart the walls in the room were dirty there was mold in the shower this won t affect most customers but it just shows another lie that they told me i m a big fan and previous to my stay i rang and spoke with the hotel to check i would be able to watch the race i checked again when i got to the hotel and both times they told me yes i would and it was on a certain channel when i looked the hotel didn t have that channel so missed the race i have stayed in a lot of hotels all around europe including barcelona and have to say this was an awful experience the problems are one thing but there customer service to deal with them was shocking i thought i was treating my partner to a nice long weekend away for our anniversary so thought i would spend a bit extra and get something a bit more special but cheaper places i ve stayed at before would of been so much nicer i would never stay here again and would advise anyone looking here to find something else there are so many other nicer and cheaper hotels in barcelona to stay in where they have got the good reviews from completely baffles me
