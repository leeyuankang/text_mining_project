needed a safe deposit box although not available in your room they were held at reception at a cost of euros per day plus a fifty euro cash deposit which i felt was rather steep and totally unaware off when you travel only for a city break of a few days to hand over a steep deposit was totally a shock however happy to pay a deposit but by card would be much easier and simpler
