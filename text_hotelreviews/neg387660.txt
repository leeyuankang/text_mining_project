some areas of the hotel were very dark i e seated area near outdoor terrace on ground floor equally not enough light on the private terraces within bedrooms slightly more light would encourage people to sit out at night i upgraded to a extra large bed with private terrace based on the online photos which makes the rooms and bathrooms look huge sadly that isn t the case
