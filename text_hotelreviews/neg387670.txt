i was without power for an entire evening and night with no torches or candles being provided i found it difficult to find my way to the toilet as my mobile battery was drained given the power outage for hours in the evening i was still expected to pay in full for the night at the hotel during the night i was disturbed by a drunken guest who kept falling in the corridor outside my door as the emergency lights did not work during the power outage i could not call reception to complain as the phone lines were also not working
