i was in room and unable to open the small frosted window so absolutely no natural ventillation and liitle or no natural light which i absolutely hate pretty claustrophobic the dining room is plain depressing it s so dark they d be better served removing the extremely small swimming pool which is a total waste of space to let some natural light pour into the dining room
