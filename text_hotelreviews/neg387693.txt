the wifi was very slow in our room as it was the last room on the floor we asked for the quiet room but we were given a whole modem to put in our room which was great and the wifi was fast no iron in the room but we were given one right away we were given two single beds put together which served as one double bed which was annoying coz they kept moving away from each other
