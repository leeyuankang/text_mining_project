a few weeks earlier i had cancelled a night stay and was charged for night but the cancellation policy did not make it clear that they would start charging at midnight of the date you could cancel i contacted the hotel and they never replied to me i since have stayed there upon booking again and i was very happy but i think their customer service could ve been handled a bit better
