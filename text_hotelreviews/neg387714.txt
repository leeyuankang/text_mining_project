quite a few things could be improved first the breakfast was basic nothing special really no facial tissues in the bathroom poor quality of pillows tv had only spanish language channels air conditioner was average most annoying was the bright blue light from the tv that could not be turned off and shined directly on the bed outside the patio was nice but the tiles were loose the pool is not suitable for swimming
