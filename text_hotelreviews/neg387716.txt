our room was pretty much directly above the london bar a couple of stories below and the bar and street noise was loud each night until around also our room was very hot and when i asked at reception they explained that as yet the cooling for the air conditioning had not yet been switched on for the summer my view is that there is better value accommodation in barcelona than this hotel
