staff were mostly rude and tried to rush me on check in even though there was no one in line their air conditioning is terrible it was colder in the lobby than my room which had ac on full blast for hours when i told reception about this problem they wanted to check it out themselves as if they didn t believe me then when they got to my room they felt the air vent and said yes it is working omg it was like pulling teeth getting them to change us to a room that was actually cold
