we stayed in one of the disabled rooms there wasn t enough room to get a wheelchair up to the bed to transfer my husband as he can t walk at all so i had to push the bed right over the bathroom was spacious but had a bath shower not a wet room so again not very good for a serverly disabled person when i rang the hotel i did explain how disabled my husband is when i asked about disabled facilities they said the room was good which for a partially disabled person it would be but for someone serverly disabled it wasn t i think it s really important to maybe stress when a hotel has disabled facilities the room has a wet room and not a bath and maybe a picture of the room and bathroom which some hotels do
