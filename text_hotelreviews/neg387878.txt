very bad guest service the front office staff don t smile at you they always stare only two people in front office gave a warm and pleasant response when we approached them the staff for breakfast don t have time to receive and seat you you have to find a clean table to be seated or you have to pick a table and tell them to clean poor staffing for breakfast the hotel cooling system is not set on during april even though the outside temperature is c plus so the room will be more hotter if you turn it on you will be dependent on opening the windows for fresh and cool air which is unsafe and traffic noise at night toilets aren t clean
