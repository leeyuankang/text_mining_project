the bed was extremely uncomfortable the mattress is very soft to the point where if you aren t sleeping in the middle of the bed you might fall off of it i woke up with back pains as well we ended up switching hotels because of it there was no dresser to put your clothes in which was also kind of a bummer other than that the hotel is old so if you like something modern it s not that personally that didn t really bother me
