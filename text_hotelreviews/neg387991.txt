we had to ask twice for changing of the room before we got a good one first one had twin beds rather than a double bed that i booked and the second one was extremely noisy i booked this hotel specifically for soundproofed rooms the room we got had an entire wall made from old windows facing the street and i could not sleep the first night at all luckily they allowed us to switch the room and the final one we got was quiet and nice the breakfast was extremely expensive for a star hotel more than eur per person so we did not take it even though i would have wanted to
