popping noises from the wall behind the wc were quite a big problem they kept waking me up in the middle of the night and in the morning before the alarm clock they were quite loud comparable to the noises of popcorn popping in the microwave it must have been the water dropping somehow from a large height in the pipes and splashing against some surface the staff offered me another room but i was already unpacked and didn t know whether the same problem didn t occur in other rooms the room had also very little sunlight as it had a window looking at a narrow backyard during the day it was almost completely dark i had to turn on the lights breakfast buffet lacked vegetarian options e g vegetables or veggie sandwich paste if you wanted to put something on the sandwich there was only cheese and jam to choose from
