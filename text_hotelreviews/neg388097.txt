it s not the first time we stay there and this time our room was in the or floor do not remember exactly and we didn t like that people were working in the terrace or roof that is in the middle so we didn t have privacy and there are lot of machines there so the noise was not nice the other thing is that the gym was under construction and nobody told us that before and for us the gym is the thing for choosing a hotel so we had a bad experience with that
