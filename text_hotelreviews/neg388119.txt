as i checked in they gave me a very different rate than the one i booked around more expensive i had to show them my booking com confirmation and the rate that i booked after mins of checking and some digging they told me it was a mistake and they gave me booking com rate i usually understand that mistakes happen and dont complain however this felt like it was an intentional mistake i could be wrong after check in everything was great
