our room was not available at check in time and we were requested to come back an hour later duly did so and was still not ready so we were asked to wait in hotel bar manager gave my daughter a free teddy and postcard book as an apology which was very sweet room debbie breakfast was appalling at each plus service you would have expected better it was not late not all there the waiter went back twice to get missing items and absolutely every single item was stone cold i would definitely stay here again as the location was amazing and facilities in the apartment were great but not order any food
