the friendly receptionist looked up a room within our category but with some extra space as we needed a crib for our baby she failed to inform us that it was on a smoking floor which we didn t notice until we were back to put baby down as we originally just went up to get bags put away and then went straight out to meet friends the room smelt fine but each time we opened the door there was a bad cigarette smell that came in from the hallway room was still great but smell in the hallway was quite off putting
