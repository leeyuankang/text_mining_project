although i booked a room with a king bed i was given a room with a queen bed when i informed the staff the said thats what available and booking com has made a mistake i made a request for extra bed the hotel staff denied receiving any advise from booking com obviously there is a miss communication between the hotel and booking com this has cause discomfort as our years child had to sleep with us in a queen size bed
