extremely disappointed with our stay overpriced we took an executive suite which are the best rooms but these had zero sound proofing with every noise heard from corridor other rooms street noise etc and the rooms were also uncomfortably hot this was in october staff lacking customer service skills reception duty manager inability to deal with several issues during our stay the hotel is understaffed in my opinion i would not recommend this hotel to anyone this has also severely tainted my view of the best western brand
