a little detail would be too consider how many people are in the room when it comes to teas and coffees etc we only had bottle of water each of the coffees and each of the milks we wernt overly bothered as we were not in the room long a little tricky getting out of the shower as the door is level to the floor and as it is a walkin shower wetroom its difficult to put the shower mat down
