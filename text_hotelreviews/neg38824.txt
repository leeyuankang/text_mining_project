derelict building next door not too attractive room size tiny not even enough room for two bedside tables despite being a double room literally room only to squeeze around the bed for the money they charge i d expect to be able at least to walk normally around the bed not shuffle sideways and i am not in any way a large or overweight person the rooms are just tiny no mini fridge in the room even though there is an empty cupboard in the desk that is mini fridge sized had to wedge the room door as it rattled noisliy any time people walked outside or closed the fire door just outside the room
