well i booked a room with a bath online and after a really tired day out when i went to my room there was only a shower and not very clean either also i asked to have a room with a bath and was told there was none left not true as the hotel was half empty that night also when i called reception and asked for a charger for just half an hour i was told there would be a charge of pounds plus deposit ludicrous as i paid a lot to stay there i then later found out that there where free chargers in the bar why wernt we told this it was really bad service and lack of knowledge of staff not knowing whats available and zero customer service i would hope to have my money refunded back in full as i do not warrant the stay a very pleasant one
