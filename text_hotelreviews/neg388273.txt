when you book and pay they will still want you to pay a refundable deposit for breakages will not be returned straight away on check out the staff are rude and far to casual for a star hotel the menus are printed on white paper with food stains max choice on food items per starter main and dessert this gets to me because the first time we stayed it was incredible one member of staff gave me an old note as change and refused to take it back even though they are not legal tender since the start of may it is overpriced food and drink
