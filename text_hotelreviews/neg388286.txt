it was only after paying that i was told that my request for twin rooms could not be accommodated and that there was only twin room and the other would be doubles aloft said that if i had booked direct with them they would guarantee to fulfil any requests but by booking through booking com they would not guarantee to fulfil any requests problems on checking out as the reception staff decided that i had not paid but this was due to the way they had checked us in by allocating all the payment to of the rooms not impressed with the reception staff and rooms were expensive still waiting for my receipt
