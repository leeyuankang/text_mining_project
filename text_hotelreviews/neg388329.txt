the attitude of the recepcion at the check in was disapointing maybe it is because of the hotel policy i booked a double bed room we got separated single beds and it was not option to change it they said also there was some hided extra expenses so be aware of that security deposit some television channel like music was on extra price so i really felt like i have to show the money all the time
