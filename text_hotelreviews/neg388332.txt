when we arrived to our bedroom we noticed on the locker there was empty water bottles teapot used used cups with lemon tea in them and also some bakery food small in a container that looked like it was sat there for a while i was afraid then that the room hadn t been attended to at all so i rang reception and they said the room had been cleaned after the last visitors left three days prior an obvious mistake and i wouldn t let it ruin my opinion of the hotel because overall it was brill the receptionist apologised straight away and the cleaning manager arrived to our room within minutes to take it away and to offer us tea coffee etc
