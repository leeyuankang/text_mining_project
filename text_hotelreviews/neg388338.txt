hotel charges an extra security deposit of pound per night upon arrival which quickly adds up if you are staying a few nights they don t take cash for this and threatened to not let me stay if i didn t pay it immediately with the card i had paid online with make sure you have this ready to hand over in advance when you arrive a bit far out and dlr trains finish up earlier than rest not ideal location if you want to have a late night out
