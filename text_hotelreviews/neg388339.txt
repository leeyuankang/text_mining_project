as we entered the room it appeared fine however there was defecation left in the toilet of which did not flush properly the mini bar was not plugged in nor was it filled we were woken up at by a housekeeper knocking on the door and then proceeding to open it even though we had the do not disturb sign on the door the food apparently finishes at so we ordered a burger at to find the kitchen staff had already gone home the hotel at first glance appears nice however you pay for what you get and what we got was not of even of a average standard
