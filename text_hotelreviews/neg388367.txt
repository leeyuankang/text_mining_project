the postcode on the booking com website wasn t correct and so made the hotel harder to find when checking in had to wait for over at reception when there were only staff on a desk with computer for another memeber to staff to come was nearly stuck in the lift when was not told when checking in about having to scan room key within the lift to get lift to move to correct floor in terms of location it s quiet area not a lot to do spirits at for single shot is way over priced
