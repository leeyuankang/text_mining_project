as a nit pick for anyone that is strongly allergic to mould they had some black mould in the nooks and crannies of the shower generally where only a very long scrubbing session of bleach or black mould remover would get rid of for anyone else however you probably wouldn t notice i only notice such occurrences because i have relatives that are allergic so i got into a habit of looking over such things with a fine tooth comb
