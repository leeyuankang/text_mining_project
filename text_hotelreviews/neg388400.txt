it was quite expensive for what it was to be quite honest the room was lovely but at for nights plus in the restaurant with cocktails at each it was very costly the restaurant menu was limited as was the tv guide on the tv even buying a little tube of toothpaste cost me the hotel also took a refundable deposit in case we used the mini bar or anything which they took twice as we chose after the first night to extend our stay so they took another which i have still not had returned even though we didn t use any of the extras
