as the stay was work related i wanted to change the payment card to my business one which is in a different name i have often done this at other hotels but this was refused there was no hot water for a shower in the morning and i was advised that a boiler had broken down these things happen but a shower is an essential part of the service i think it would have been a courtesy to offer some compensation a free breakfast or credit of some kind without having to ask after asking they agreed to pay my parking not really enough
