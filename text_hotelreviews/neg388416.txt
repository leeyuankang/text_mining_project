the main front of house staff member was unfriendly and not very helpful the free wifi was good for emails and quick google searches but anything besides that ie watching movies would not work the fire alarm was the loudest fire alarm i have ever heard and after putting my fingers into my ears for minutes my head was still ringing thought that this was more disorientating than helpful also since the hotel is pet friendly the fire alarm would seriously damage a dogs hearing the shower head was not fixed properly and hit both me and my partner on the head bad enough to leave bruises lastly the parking fee was for a day and the machine doesn t accept cards only coins
