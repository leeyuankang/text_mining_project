i was at the floor if i remember correctly during my one night stay on a saturday past night from am to am the people from the next rooms were making crazy loud noise outside their doors this is not a hostel considering the premium price i paid for the one night stay deserves a peaceful night sleep the hotel management can do better to control these uncivilized people by the way the mattress spring was not very nice as well
