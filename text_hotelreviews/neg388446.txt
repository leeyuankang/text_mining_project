parking is expensive considering its not a very secure carpark no security barriers etc although it s looked over by the hotel rooms which provides a sense some security the range of food at the hotel restaurant and their snack bar is very limited so don t really have much choice but to travel out for dinner each night also the main entrance to the hotel felt like it had been built on the wrong side of the building conflated to the car park as the car park entrance to the hotel outs the more heavily used yet less impressive compared to the one on the other side of the building
