check in was poor we were traveling with our company and although rooms were paid in full we could not check in until we had card made with booking i was made to wait four hours until all staff arrived as they also could not check in until everyone had there id could not have one and not the other who would have the company card when your boss was not travelling or staying that day for this reason we would never book again
