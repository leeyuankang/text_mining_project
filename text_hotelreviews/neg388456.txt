there was no mirror in the main living space to do your hair with appliances the pool was beautiful however it was very confusing how to access retrieve towels etc most had to ask other guests already in the pool tea tray in room was really good however only milk thimbles is not enough and when we asked downstairs for more and extra camomile tea only for people we were told we would have to pay for the tea bag this made me feel very embarrassed as it is not common practice it most hotels
