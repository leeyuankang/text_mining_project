we are older couple so our eyesight is not like it was when we were young why why why do designers insist on putting information in low contrast so it is difficult to decipher we see it time and again in the lifts at aloft the floor information is engraved into the metal plates beside the numbers and slightly darker than surrounding so we had to bend over and peer closely to try and read yes we have glasses the change rooms at the pool are unisex only two of them with obscure glass doors on two walls with no locking devices my wife was not impressed and said if she went swimming again in the pool she would walk dripping wet back to her room and change there for a supposedly innovative hotel the breakfasts were anything but extremely ordinary bordering on tasteless the hotel is located in a new development area empty offices and no shops i had to walk s to find a supermarket
