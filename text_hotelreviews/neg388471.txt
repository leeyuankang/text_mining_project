the restaurant gave my partner mayonnaise in his burger even though we told them he has allergies so he spent the evening very sick there was a used condom wrapper by the bed when we checked in the swimming pool was out of service which was disappointing as this is why we chose this hotel front desk apparently didn t receive our late check out request no choice of lunchtime meal restaurant far too expensive and menu too small will never return again
