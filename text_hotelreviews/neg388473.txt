we had to queue for over half an hour to be seen on arrival then had to give a deposit of after already pre paying for the room i was then told the swimming pool was closed due to maintenance and they were unsure if it would be reopened during our stay i also asked for a room on the bottom floor due to being claustrophobic and not being able to get in the elevator they refused so i had to carry my luggage up the stairs to the fifth floor once arriving to our room we had a twin room instead of a king sized bed that i paid extra for i was so disappointed as i had booked the hotel for my boyfriends birthday i spoke to a manager about the way i felt and he refused to do anything to help i was not refunded and i will not be using booking com again and will definitely not be returning to this awful hotel
