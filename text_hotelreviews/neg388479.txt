staff werent so nice this time around didnt like the way we have to warm up our food aswell for the snacks and etc but the man there was trying to be helpful on the other hand didnt like how i was treated in reception also when we ordered food for our room they left it in the toilet instead of the actually room which is rude and un hygienic also we left a note on booking for something nice to be done because we was there for a special ocasion nothing was done infact they gave us a room on floor not even high and with a bad view last time we was serviced way better than this time round they also didnt give us information of the wifi and their new system on ordering food online only so there is lack of information there
