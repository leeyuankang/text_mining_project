the location is a little bit far from central london yet the hotel is very close to the dlr line so it is still okay going to leicester square it took us around min our room was next to another room and therefore there was a door connect two rooms although there were doors to prevent the residents in other room to enter the noise of the other room was quite obvious and annoying
