the room felt cold and the lighting was really poor the lights in the bathroom and shower were so dull i could hardly see things clearly and the lighting over the mirrors in the bathroom felt like strip lighting which is awful to get ready under it made the room feel cold the hotel was very modern which was great but lacked a comfortable and homely feeling which i think helps when people are working away from home the room service menu wasnt particularly extensive and could do with more choice
