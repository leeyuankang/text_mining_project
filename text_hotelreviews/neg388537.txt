receptionist insisted that she needed to swipe the same card as the one that was used to book not great when the booking has been made for someone else and they don t have the card how ridiculous then told that although double beds requested they couldn t be guaranteed as we booked through a third party really its a huge hotel i am sure they had double rooms just wanted to treat us like third class citizens the bar was incredibly noisy due to music and waited mins to be ignored we gave up went to the shop to hear a minute sob story from the cashier about how she had not got her time off etc etc all in all staff were bolshy and unhelpful and unless you are a young trendy like really really loud music and don t care what type of bed you sleep in my advice would be not to bother shame though as the location is perfect and it could be really really nice if they were prepared to cater to everyone s taste
