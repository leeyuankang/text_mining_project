we arrived to be told i had booked a twin room and not a king size room i showed the girl my booking which clearly stated king size bed she said they were fully booked so we could not be moved i was in london for my brothers wedding so had no choice after fuming for mins i went down again as i was not happy i spoke to another girl and low and behold a king size room was available and we were moved with some foreign chatting between the receptionists and some dirty looks that i dared challenge them again the room was clean and bed comfy but the bathroom was pitch black with one small light they have a little self serve cafe with coffees and food the coffee was cold both times and we purchased a bacon and sausage roll and there was about half a tub of butter on the bread completely inedible
