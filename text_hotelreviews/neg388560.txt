the room was too hot the aircon wasn t man enough to cool it down so i had to endure a sleepless night without any opening windows in a room that was degrees the online room service was a massive faff the wifi dropped out several times whilst trying to make the order and when it was finally done there was no confirmation and the order was short of a couple of items when it arrived this was down to human error so rendered the whole online ordering pointless would have been much easier quicker to just order over the phone the pizza was tiny too
