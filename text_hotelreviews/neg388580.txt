restaurant was lousy sat evening the bar service was slow we asked to eat in the bar area because there weren t any tables in the restaurant a staff member said you can t the manager won t let you but didn t ask if we d like to book a table so we had to find another staff member to book they said i ll be back in minutes but didn t re appear in the end we approached a woman who appeared to be the manager she said i ll be minutes finally we booked a table but several other people were seated before us even though they didn t appear to have waited as long when we finally got a table the service was slow and the food was poor for the price breakfast was equally poor food anaemic looking fruit tasteless cooked breakfast aloft is a contemporary hotel but the food really lets the hotel down won t eat there next time
