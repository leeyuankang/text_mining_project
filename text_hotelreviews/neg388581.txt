slight mishap when ordering dinner we were told that we couldn t get a table for women told we had to wait mins we went away to consider booking table or order room service came back to restaurant to see if we can book table then saw the manager had offered a table for people adult men straight away we then told assistant that we can wait for table but then told the restaurant was closing in mins which contradicted what the manager feeling disgruntled we were then offered room service but had to order online through an app we ordered small rissotos soup and bread which came to we got very large portions of rissotos and soup which we couldn t eat and they forgot the bread next morning when we checked out they had charge over for the food and they had charged for large portions apparently a new process that still needs tweaking customer service rectified quickly with no problem just bad service from restaurant side
