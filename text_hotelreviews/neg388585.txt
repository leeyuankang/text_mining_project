door to toilet and shower was sliding which was a bit weird and the shower went all over the floor which was a bit of a pain breakfast was very disappointing and i wish we hadn t had it tables were full of dirty pots and when we did find a table we had to lay it ourselves i can only describe the breakfast as being luke warm although it was tasty the cut fruit wasn t in refrigerated units neither was the fruit juice so these weren t cold
