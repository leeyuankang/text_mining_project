the extra s in the hotel were a tad over priced even considering that the area is within london i am mainly referring to the bar and restaurant for this comment one request was made for food either as a seperate purchase or substitute as chips are supplied with burger orders but not as an individual item my partner is a fussy eater and the restaurant was only operating a buffet on this day as opposed to its normal menu with the bar offering burgers and pizza but the staff declined the request which i thought was a bit harsh considering the limited options at the time the food was then delivered in two separate sittings as opposed to being brought together which you would expect at any dining establishment
