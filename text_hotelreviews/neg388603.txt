english wasn t the first spoken language of the reception staff thus causing confusion in them explaining their policy with regards authorising your bank card for breakables this was not explained correctly at check in by the female member if staff at when i was tired ready to get to my room but the male member of staff tried to clarify upon check out however i am still unsure as to what amount has actually been authorised from my bank card this probably meaning i won t use this hotel again due to hidden charge amounts
