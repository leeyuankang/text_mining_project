sadly it didnt live up to its full promise because you are pretty much reliant on the restaurant for food in the evening as there is nothing else within walking distance after a full day working on a stand at excel when i was tired and very hungry it was quite unbelievable to be told at that the dining room was fully booked and they wouldnt be serving anyone else that evening there were clearly tables available and a colleague who was in the restaurant at the time told me later that nobody sat at the tables either side of them all evening if another colleague had not had a car to drive me to a supermarket about five minutes drive away i would have been unable to have any food at all that evening apart from a limited stock of sandwiches in the hotel shop such a shame but this really was unacceptable i also think to charge people per for parking is outrageous
