we were asked to transfer hotel said it was just block off incase we use any service pound for each of our nights there that was nearly euros it was taken out of our account straight away money we could not use for our holiday and something we had not planed on it took days after we left for it to come back into our account and you are not warned about this before hand which i believe the hotel should have made us aware of this cost before we arrived
