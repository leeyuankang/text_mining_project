bed was too firm for my taste but fine if you like that kind of bed wifi was ok when it got going but had some hiccups every now and then beds felt a little short i m only ft and felt small to me only real issue i had was with the take to room burger the burger was amazing but at pounds if expect more than a great burger with some soggy wedges on the side
