my only disappointment was being denied an egg breakfast dish after check out in the restaurant at noon when on the room menu you can get breakfast hours made no sense to me that they wouldn t make an exception especially considering i had been a guest for several days and even brought people in for dinner in their restaurant the night before this place seems to have service that goes above and beyond except if you want something on one menu but not on another i would definitely return here but maybe next time order what i want in the room also to note i m a genius on booking com and was under the assumption i was getting early check in and late check out when i arrived early i was told that only applies if a room is ready makes sense and i had requested a specific type of room so made even more sense what surprised me was day of check out i called and mentioned my late check out and there was no note for it they said had to be requested day of the booking app makes one feel like they are doing it for you wasn t the case here wasn t a problem they extended me an hour but just something to know when you book thru this app
