i chose this hotel because it was in soho and close to the piccadilly station while the area immediately adjacent to the hotel is peaceful piccadilly is a zoo and initially when i would return to the hotel the day or two finding my way back to the hotel from the tube was very confusing so many diagonal streets look alike but a doorman told me the trick and that really helped nice bar but almost too lively a bar scene
