it s generally a pretty expensive place already my room cost around a night and i know hotels hold money for security purposes but at the ham yard they held per night i was there for a week and they casually took from my account like it was totally normal to take such a high amount for security i stay in a lot of hotels and i ve never had to pay this much before i didn t like this and yes i got the money back but it was such a big amount unexpected i m not sure if i d do his again
