it is extremely frustrating the long waiting line at the entrance to the breakfast room they have to find a more simply way to check the identity of the guests and to know which one has the breakfast included or not in addition if you are unlucky to have one or two persons who have to pay for the breakfast on spot it is a nightmare it takes several minutes for the bills to be printed and signed
