could hear music from the sky lounge in our room on the floor which was very annoying got moved to the floor for our night but could still hear it so don t go for a courtyard room if you want to relax they held on my credit card at check in while telling us the card would not be charged at that time breakfast is ridiculously expensive the sky lounge is very expensive and had loud music playing so hard to talk to each other very busy and impersonal
