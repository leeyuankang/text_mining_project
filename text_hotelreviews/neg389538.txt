the staff on the front desk were a little rude our room was not ready for hours having already confirmed i could have an early check in through booking com i was not pleased when i arrived we had to wait in the lobby then after requesting a late check out as our flight was not until i was charged an extra amount to stay in the room not only this there was a complete mix up on the payment i had requested to pay for rooms however the front desk messed this up and had to refund my friend there was a few complications the rooms are very basic no design element at all the cupboard was tiny and there wasn t that much room to leave your things not only this we had a room facing the train tracks every morning we got woken up by the trains passing through not ideal if you want a relaxing stay a basic hotel for the price
