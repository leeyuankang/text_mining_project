overall the hotel was nice good location by central station and the rooms were clean and large by european standards however the hotel outdoor bar stays open on the weekends until am if you have a room facing the bar the music is loud in your room until closing i may expect this to occur at a budget hotel but given the price of the hotel my expectation was that i would not be kept awake by loud music additionally the electricity went off on my floor around and was not turned back on until while this may not be the hotels fault it was not pleasant in the morning trying to get ready with no electricity
