mixed experience with the reception staff first couple of people we dealt with weren t particularly attentive and as we needed support with a question on our booking made us feel like we were an inconvenience which wasn t a pleasant start also we had three room travelling as a family and were given three rooms each on completely different floors creating challenges during the stay finally one room had a very strong smell of cigarette luckily when raising this last point we dealt with a very nice and attentive receptionist who helped immediately and gave us another room this was appreciated and went some way to make up for the earlier issues
