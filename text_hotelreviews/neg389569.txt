after paying for a night stay in an executive suite with view i have come away very disappointed we were put in a room overlooking the train tracks and could see nothing else it was awful as well as this the windows were dirty and the bed was very uncomfortable in a good location but staff and the woman who dealt with my complaint were very rude i would advise to book a hotel in the same area but not the hilton absolute waste of money i will never stay here again
