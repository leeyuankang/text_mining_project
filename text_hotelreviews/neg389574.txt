we stay in floor and floor is a night club named sky lounge first you can hear loud music and people screaming all the time untill am then if you called the staff to solve this problem they would offer you some ear plugs sounds interesting because i spend euros for one night stay with ear plugs on why don t i stay on a cheap hotel which is really on top of a club for euro finally the view of floor is blocked by another building hence we could only see some grass on top of another building if this night only cost euro i would give it a but unfortunately they did not provide me the service that i think worth the money bad experience especially for euro per night
