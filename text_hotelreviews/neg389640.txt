found the room hugely uncomfotable very small bed was worst we have ever slept on quilt too small for the size of the bed literally room does not have a television meaning you cannot actually spend any relaxing time in the room instead you are supplied with a mac computer with around english channels and internet access which does not support any video format like netflix etc which would of been a understanding consolation room was not supplied with any water bottles and hotel charged for two small bottles we chose this hotel as we expected to be able to spend some time in the room relaxing so was very disappointed hotel also charges an additional on arrival without warning will definatly be finding another place to stay when we visit amsterdam again
