our experience at the sky lounge was awful we were made to feel unwelcome waited over minutes for one drink which i had to resolve myself by going to the bar supervisor we were dealt with in am offhand manner by a female member if staff whilst other customers around us were served quickly very disappointed as this was why we chose the hotel on recommendations from friends and family
