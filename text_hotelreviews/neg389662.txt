we ordered room service on the first night and was told it would be half an hour an hour later it still hasn t come so i phoned back up and was told it was on its way another hour passed and i was about to fall asleep so i phoned up to cancel it i was then told by a polite female we could get breakfast free of charge due to it being late at night we woke up and it was to late to take advantage of this offer also on the first night we went up to sky lounger in which i was told to take a seat and we would get table service again we waited half an hour before someone took our order and waited another half hour before the drinks came out in which we was also short changed by a couple of euros i always leave a tip but don t expect someone to take it before we give it we then left and didn t wish to spend time in the hotel other than to sleep at night this morning someone entered our room at whilst we was sleeping so i asked for them to leave and didn t appreciate being woken up when we didn t have to leave until so to conclude i chose your hotel to make our time away more special but was not made to feel welcome due to all of the above
