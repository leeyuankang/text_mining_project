room is very small i expected a more spacius room and shower when we arrived the room was dusty and looked unclean balcony was much worse with tons of cigarete buds that wasnts cleaned also during our nights stay we had our coffee on the balcony and left the cups on the table when we came back to the room later after it has been cleaned the coffee cups were still there so probably they are not cleaning the balcony at all we collected some garbage and put it on the floor next to the door in a bag and it also remained there after the room has been cleaned also the water pressure in the shower was very poor expected so much more from a hiltom operated hotel
