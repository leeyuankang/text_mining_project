rooms are tiny dusty poorly furnished tiny bathroom with standing shower poor drainage in sink and shower tv is an apple computer wifi too slow to stream rooms with view really mean rooms with view to other hotel room towels and bathrobes were so hard minibar was completely empty the skylounge has incredible views but is super overpriced for what you get and we can say that because we don t mind spending for quality this hotel is so incredibly overpriced and not worthy of stars at all you only pay for location which is perfect for short stay travelers right at the train station and minutes walk to the city center do not pay for a luxurious place to stay pay if you need a convenient location for your trip
