we were provided the room which was not even cleaned properly i wouldn t expect a dirty toilet even in a star hotel we showed the picture to the staff and then we were later moved to different room on friday night we ordered indian chicken curry from their menu and it turned out to be a disaster probably it was our mistake to have ordered indian dish there in amsterdam but we were craving for indian food basic things like shower caps etc were not there over all it didn t meet my expectations as i feel it wasn t value for money
