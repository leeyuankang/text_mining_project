though it s wonderful as a tourist hotel if you re on holiday it really is not a great business hotel there is no real business center from which to work and it s quite busy there are two computers in the lobby attached to a printer but they are basically use to print boarding passes and various other travel documents however each room is equipped with an imac desktop computer that you can print from to the reception desk
