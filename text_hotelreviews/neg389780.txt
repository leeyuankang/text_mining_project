when we arrived our booking was not in the system we had booked a suite as it was a special occasion the receptionist was difficult about the situation and really did not treat us with much courtesy instead offering us a basic room for a nominal discount we stood our ground and eventually got sorted out but i really would have liked for it to be dealt with in a more professional manner the rooms were very basic which i suppose i am used to with amsterdam hotels however i do expect a certain standard with the housekeeping on both occasions the maid had been it looked like half a job i don t think i would stay here again in comparison to the other double trees we have stayed at it really was a little bit disappointing a shame really when it promised so much
