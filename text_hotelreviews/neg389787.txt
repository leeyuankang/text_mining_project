the fact that on check in the staff didn t say the rate included breakfast when it did and not having had breakfast in the hotel they would refund the ie x days instead they tried to blame me for not checking the confimation but the booking com on my iphone did not confirm either so i paid twice each day for breakfast i will not stay at a hilton again i use hotels a lot and on check in they normally tell you the breakfast times and location but this hilton did not do that
