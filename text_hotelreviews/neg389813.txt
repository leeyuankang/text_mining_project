it was super over priced for a night you are aloud to expect a lot more the corridors were not very nice and up to scratch room was comfortable but again for that sort of price it could be a lot more luxurious and a bit bigger there is paper cups instead of mugs for coffee and plastic cups instead of glasses in the bathroom i mean thats not really a problem but it s what you would expect from a motelone not from a hotel that is more than double the price per night restaurant looked nice but also very packed there were some problems connecting to the wifi but it worked after a call to the lobby and a short conversation with the it company again nice hotel and everything is fine but maybe for a motelone type price my max for this hotel would be per night for the price we payed the room needs to be more up to scratch
