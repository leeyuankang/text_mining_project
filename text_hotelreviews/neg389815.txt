despite allowing dogs this is not a particularly pet friendly hotel making you sign a somewhat restrictive waiver room allocated was in a very busy and noisy part of the property which is disrupting for animals staff will accommodate a change if you ask room was small and furnishings not clean stained chair and marked carpet expensive by comparison lifts were ridiculously busy and unpleasant at peak hours no close toileting spot for animals lit light switch on the wall is very bright at night
