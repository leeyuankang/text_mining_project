initial reception started well with towel arrived during a storm and warm biscuit then the hard sell started first was to have access to executive lounge which we did not want once refused we were told that there was still a great room available it turned out that this was on the floor and when i noted that others had commented that this was noisy from the bar above the receptionist agreed that we were unlikely to have undisturbed sleep the only other option was a courtyard view room which considering i had already paid for a deluxe room we were disappointed with eventually i paid an upgrade to get a room with a city view and the unwanted executive lounge was thrown in the manner of this young lady was pushy and very unpleasant a shame as other hotel staff were friendly and helpful i would not recommend this hotel on our reception experience and the eventual high price of the room
