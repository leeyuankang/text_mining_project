the sky lounge is extortionately priced it was for a tanqueray and tonic it was upwards of for a cappuccino there was no happy hour or offers for hotel residents and we were priced out of the place so there is no incentive to go there this is a shame considering it had real potential to be the cherry on top of a great weekend
