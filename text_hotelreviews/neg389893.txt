room was not cleaned at all and i m not exaggerating though we complained several times we had to call each night when we are back to get some extra towels and someone trying to make it clean while we are in they are still authorising money on my visa until today because they couldn t pull the money from my gold credit card though i paid with another they charged me drinks that i never took and asked me to pay until they investigate i had a flight so i had to pay and go staff at the reception with the exception of one duty manager where extremely rude and not friendly the whole hotel experience was louzy and unwelcoming
