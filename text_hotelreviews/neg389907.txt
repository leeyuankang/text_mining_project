room smelled terrible from smokers in a non smoking room they brought an air purifier but it didn t do enough and to top it off there was a full ashtray outside our door when we arrived should have known it wasn t going to end well they did do a nice solid and selected my wife as guest of the day great little bonus but sadly we selected our perks and were told it would be in our room when it was ready fruit basket w wine and drink vouchers for the sky bar sadly they were not there and after my wife asked the front desk twice they finally came through hope if they try to make people feel special in the future they follow thru the first time not the third tried watching the news on the mac that is the tv and because of the air purifier you couldn t hear it nice amenity but poorly executed if it is to double as the tv so i read the paper instead and did get to see an awesome london times editorial cartoon lampooning trump so maybe it s a win
