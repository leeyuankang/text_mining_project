we didn t try the breakfast buffet as at all but euros we considered it too expensive apart from that just a couple of gripes our room was on the cold side a matter which would no doubt have been remedied if we had complained and the complimentary toiletries shampoo conditioner and body lotion were impossible to use the holes in the top of the containers were too small and one couldn t squeeze out the contents because the containers were too rigid i suggest the management tries for themselves
