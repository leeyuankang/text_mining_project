both my wife and i came off a river cruise with chest infections the hotel allowed us an early check in however on entering our room we found that instead of the city or garden view promised in the booking com information we found our view consisted if railway lines with nearly trains a day passing our floor room as we were both sick we could not be bothered asking to shift and to their credit after i complained about the room the hotel credited our dinner we had on the first night not real value however at euros plus per night just a warning don t get room unless you are a train buff
