there was some confusion with the room number so we ended up with laundry that was not supposed to be for us and also an anniversary present that was supposed to be for the couple staying in the room they forgot to release the deposit on my credit card for which i then had to call my bank a week after i had already paid for the stay the hotel is always busy which may be a question of taste but since we were there for a private stay we found this rather unnerving
