awful terrible service i requested to change my booking as i had a change of plan i was travelling for business and not on holiday the staff at front desk took ten minutes to talk to the manager to tell me they couldn t help me i had to contact booking com i was pressed for time on a short stay when i asked to change the booking i had to rush to a meeting i did have the time to call or e mail booking com wait for their reply take it back to the reception and again wait for them to process the change in booking this was an absolute farce i had just previously stayed at the marriott at the city before and they had absolutely no problem accommodating the same request i even stayed with them again after returning from a meeting in another city the front desk staff told me it s not our room anymore we sell it to booking com they were simply wrong it s their hotel they simply pass on the commission for the stay to booking com yet more mis leading information on their booking com description they advertise as offering crabtree evelyn toiletries they most certainly do not their toiletries are aroma actives essentials by sysco guest supply i use crabtree evelyn and it appealed to me when making my booking sadly hilton once again disappointed it does not encourage me to stay at any hilton property again and i don t think i would recommend to my colleagues or business partners either they may not care for the loss of business but i don t think it would be insignificant all i got from the hotel manager was a standard rather insincere apology and an offer of a discount on my next stay however it is not the price or discount that matters to me but the service service is what matters for business travellers as opposed to leisure travel sorry hilton if you got to the end of this rather long review
