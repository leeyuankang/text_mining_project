i m not usually one to complain but the bathroom towel rail was permanently on and extremely hot the sink in the bathroom was very small being on the first floor was extremely noisy in the morning and i was awakened early it was very hot in london this weekend and the air conditioning was broken making the room uncomfortable at times i was also unhappy that i d left some change out on the side in the bathroom and when i returned on sunday evening that money had disappeared i know this is a small thing and it wasn t a great amount of money but it still should not have been taken another gripe was that a wine glass from the night before was not taken away the next day either
