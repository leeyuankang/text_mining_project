poor lighting in the room despite the fact one of the bed side lights was out of order no carpet on the floor making the room feeling unpleasant and in general dark the bathroom hairdryer the main body where the hot air comes out smashed broken shower head whichever direction twisted still water spreading on the floor whilst the shower screen over the bathtub in place toilet seat cover one plug fitting missing exposing a little hole the bottom part of the bathroom door the paint has gone probably due to dampness a hand wash basin chipped at the very front place i was also not happy about the quality of the juice served at the breakfast multivitamin like tasted slightly fermented i mentioned to staff about this and i was apologised and served a fresh one straight from the new box which tasted differently very good staff at the reception friendly but the appearance not very professional with funky pinkish colour glasses and no smart shirt as for star hotel was quite strange experience
