the wifi was rubbish so much so that most of the time my ipad connected to the stronger signal from the adjacent meridien the room unfortunately looked out onto the ring which sounds nice but the traffic noise was bad especially as the air con was not working so if you closed the albeit good double glazed window it was a bit stuffy better to try a hotel on a quieter street and one that has real wifi
