the hotel seemed to not be in the best condition the walls were painted poorly and the floor made a lot of noise there was a bad smell in the entire hotel and everything seemed worn out and outdated the interior was cheap and the corners of the windows were moulding the batteries of the remote control were empty and the tv signal broke down several times it was loud and noisy during the night but became even worse in the morning when you heard and felt the rumbling of the elevator and people shutting the doors
