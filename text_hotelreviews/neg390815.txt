some noise from outside though i usually take earplugs with me to hotels anyway the third floor rooms might not be very convenient as they sort of open to and are adjacent to the breakfast room where no doubt staff starts preparations early and people might arrive to eat from am when breakfast starts i was lucky to get a room on the but i still heard some coming and going from above after i woke up again earplugs so there was no actual annoyance for me
