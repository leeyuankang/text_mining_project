the room i booked was for my partners birthday surprise and was nice but a little small the package i booked was rose petals and bottle of bubbles on arrival which was lovely the one on the website was a lot larger or an excellent camera shoot luckily i don t get up in the night but if i had of the space between the wall and the bed would of been interesting as very tight
