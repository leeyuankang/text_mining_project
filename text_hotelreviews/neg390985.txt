the reason i chose to stay at this hotel was because they had a pool if you look at the picture of the pool it looks amazing when you see it in reality it s very small i went for a swim later on my first day there was a sign up that it was being renovated the pool was closed for my whole day visit the manager gave us off but i was still extremely disappointed the room was very hot at night and the air conditioner fan did nothing i didn t want to open the window because the street below was too noisy
