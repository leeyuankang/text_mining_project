the shower pressure was awful and the temperature fluctuates badly the taps of the bath were loose abd need some maintenance there are no tea and coffee facilities in the room which is ridiculous given the price the housekeeping did not clean or replace the wine glasses in the room the pool the main reason we chose the hotel was closed but there was no notice or reduction in price
