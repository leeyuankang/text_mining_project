my experience with this hotel was far away from anything i don t understand how do they dare to advertise it with on trip advisor air condition didn t work hotel staff refused to fix it referring to the central heating they cannot turn off it was extremely warm in the room despite the open window we were given another room after we complained air condition didn t work either but at least this room was not on the sunny side of the building and not that warm no bar no restaurant at the hotel what was available nearby was not well suited for tourists while could be good for locals no chance to sleep saturday night due to the drunk crowd coming out of the night club next door signing something very loud till am closing the window was not an option due to above the swimming pool was nice but one of the ladders was half broken that scared me wall mount for the shower was broken in the first room tiny rooms like m bathrooms super tiny terrible coffee from the machine in the breakfast room and this in vienna
