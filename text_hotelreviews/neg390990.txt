environment around the hotel is not children friendly many suspected people especially in the evening time are jumping up and down the streets with looks in their faces and behavior this is not the situation in the street to the hotel but unfortunately the threat is existend in the close proximity to the side streets you have to cross if you are using public transportation or if you want to reach the hotel by foot from a close metro stop a metro stop directly in front of the hotel is there but due to several metro stops close by sometimes it makes sense to use another line and to drop in another station and to walk the rest to the hotel to be more neutral maybe this is the case for all big cities thin walls you can hear every door closing and opening nearby even neighborhood chat could be heard although not clearly to understand the conversation still annoying very tiny old fashioned bathroom i felt not comfortable had a feeling of disgust to walk in without touching the door is almost not possible no accessories to prepare tea or coffee rooms need restauration floor is broken on some parts very thin pillows more a hotel of between and stars
