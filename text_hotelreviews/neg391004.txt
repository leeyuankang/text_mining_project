once we settled in there were a few things that made us question the quality of the hotel including a flooded shower a hard bed with a flat pillow and a door that allowed the light to shine in from the corridor but there were sufficient shades from the curtains too it was strange for us not to get something other than beer or water or something to eat in the evening at the hotel bar but they were small complaints in the end as our general impression was a good one we had a great deal and were happy in the end and a little tip there s a great park and ride nearby in ottakring for only hours should you not get a space in the hotel s parking lot as in our case
