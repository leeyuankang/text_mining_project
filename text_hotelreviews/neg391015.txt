the internet was not working in the room there was no way to regulate the heating it took us hour to check in there was one staff on reception dealing with a big group and wait of an hour that we could have used for sight seeing the phone to the reception did not work so we had to go down everytime we had a problem we were told to try the internet every few mins which didnt work and each time to report it it was a trip down to reception we stayed nights and each day the staff promised it would be fixed but no one did anything we had booked it non refundable otherwise we would have moved hotels could do without the hassle when travelling and planning our trip
