the cancelation policy of the hotel is bit strange so pay attantion to it closely in a hotel garage there was no available parking so we had to keep our car on the street the room was spacious as we got for three people but it was not the cleanest there was no king size bed but two connected beds which is very annoying also the bathroom was renovated but the cleaness was not up to expectations we also stayed in exe hotel in marid as exe hotels are spanish chain which had amazing location and the room was amazing so we stayed a bit disappointed with the one in vienna
