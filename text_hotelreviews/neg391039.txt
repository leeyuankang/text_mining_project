we arrived here for a one night trip and stayed overlooking the car parks at the back and grotty houses the pool was out of order due to an apparent short term breakage yet looked as though it had been out of order for some time no apologies or money off the cost of stay even though that is one of the main reasons we booked the hotel there was also no other pools nearby that we were given access to breakfast is not it is cheap and nasty only nice part is the coffee machine made
