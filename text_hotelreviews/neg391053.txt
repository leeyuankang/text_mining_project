pool was out of service for the entirety of our stay days safe did not work there was a lot of noise from the street below we were given a room on the street side even though we requested a quiet room although some of our friends paid for breakfast when booking there was some mix up because they had not updated the info in their system i think about this and the breakfast police spoiled the mood a little finally as with other exe hotels i ve been too they were pretty stingey with toiletries we were given one tiny bottle of shower gel for two people for four days
