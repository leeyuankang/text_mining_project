i arrived at the hotel and was notified that i could not have my ordered room and instead was booked an alternative hotel not far away i booked this hotel due to the walking distance to the akh hospital where i was to lecture they ordered and paid the cab i arrived at the other hotel also star only to be notified that the first hotel ordered only rooms in this hotel and there wasn t a reservation for me they got on the phone and told me they would pay a cab to another hotel the other side of the city i insisted to stay and eventually they agreed to book a room in that hotel mind you the booking com price for the new hotel was even a few euros cheaper than the original hotel i booked very frustrating when you have a business trip on a very tight schedule
