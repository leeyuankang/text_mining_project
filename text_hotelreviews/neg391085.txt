our first night at the hotel was terrible people living in the next room was a school group ca yo that were partying whole night it was impossible to sleep even though we all had earplugs we didn t expect that star hotel will be more noisy than the cheapest hostel the worst thing was when in our room started fire alarm at am because the partying people were smoking in their room right next us it was really unpleasant experience after we called room service they only told us that they know about it great we considered to change the hotel right away after we complained and want some explanation we got discount well the purpose of staying at a hotel is to sleep there in our case it was impossible so we expected at least discount
