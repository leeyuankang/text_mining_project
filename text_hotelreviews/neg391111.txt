we did not like the amount of noise throughout the night and the day it seemed like the walls were paper thin there seemed to be someone moving furniture all night and during the morning and it was hard to get a good night sleep the safe did not work upon arrival we called the front desk and they send the maintenance guy over but he couldn t fix it so he just said he was sorry and that it was a busy time of year they needed more time to fix all the broken boxes wifi was very flaky and slow even when working the bed and the pillows were not very comfortable pillows were flat and mattress just seemed a bit old worn out all tv shows were in a foreign language german spanish no english
