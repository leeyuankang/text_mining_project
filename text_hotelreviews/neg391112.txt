breakfast was very poor food was constantly running out we had to ask for more food to be brought out coffee was really bad i wouldn t even call it coffee it was some coffee looking powder based liquid the tables were not very clean and it took a long time to have the tables cleaned up the hotel room was really unorganized could hardly pass by the bed without hitting yourself in the mini fridge no sitting area dirty windows
