the heating in the room did not work neither in the bathroom the room was tiny and we had booked it for one person but there was a big double bed in it and it was most difficult to walk around the bed to reach the window it was quite a few degrees colder than outside in the hallway there was no shower just a bathtub and since i had booked the room for my mother who is years old she could not have a wash also because it was so terribly cold the lady at reception told me they would fix it the next day however my mother only stayed for one night and i am sure they knew about the problem the lady at reception in the morning was most kind and helpful and offered us breakfast as a sort of compensation
