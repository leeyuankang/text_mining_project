me and my friend got a twin room instead of a double room as requested but maybe they did not have any double rooms available this was not a problem the central heating did not work at all it was a bit cold at night and especially during the first night even if we covered ourselves very well with the blankets the hotel should investigate and repair the heating system someone tried to enter our room on one of our first nights by pushing it claiming that he had the same room as ours i saw the room carton handed to me by him under the door i calmly replied that he should talk to the reception and i shortly reported the incident to the reception myself i received a call from the receptionist that she noted down the room number wrongly but she gave the man the right key card obviously not to our room this should never have happened there was a problem with my card details on booking website unfortunately the woman who replied to my e mails did not express herself in english properly and me and my friend thought our reservation was not valid fixed and we could end up without any accommodation just a few days before arriving in vienna afterwards i understood that my nonreturnable reservation was indeed firm and i entered my card details one more time it seems that these details are erased from a reservation after some time and the hotel did not take my money the moment i booked the trouble was that the hotel requested those details a little too late the staff should pay more attention to booking website regulations and inform the clients in a clearer manner regarding their reservations the daily cleaning did not include sweeping the floor bits and pieces left over from us were still there at the end of our stay i was initially charged for parking for one of our nights and i reported not using it therefore i did not pay it in the end a tall lamp in the room had its power cord cut and was unusable
