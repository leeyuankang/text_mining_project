i really didn t appreciate that the pool was cold even though it was an inside pool and it was advertised on the official website as heated and the parking was also full when we arrived so we had to park the car somewhere near the hotel and the next day we remained without it because it was picked up by the police and we had to pay eur to get it back and another eur on a cab to get us in that car park not a nice experience at all
