staff was really rude we arrived at the hotel late at night and they couldn t find our reservation they kept talking between themselves not translating anything into english for us in the end they gave us a room but we had to insist for the parking which we had booked via booking as well no information about breakfast either swimming pool could be cleaner as there were lots of hairs floating about
