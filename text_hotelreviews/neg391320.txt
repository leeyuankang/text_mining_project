even though i prepaid two nights including tax through booking com for three rooms we we charged an extral euro per room at checkout total of which was almost an entire nights rate also when we arrived at the airport we were told that the airport shuttle cost euro per person with that in mind we took a taxi to the hotel there were of us and paid euro plus tip when we arrived at the hotel i questioned that fee because when i booked the reservations the info said the shuttle was free turns out that because we booked before june there was no cost to us for the shuttle other than all the added fees which added up to almost euro the hotel was nice and a good value would have given it a higher score
