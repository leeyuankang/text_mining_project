i didnt like the fact that it was a minute bus ride into town where you could have some breakfast at a reasonable price euro is a very expensive breakfast so we bought bananas to have in our room and then travel into leidseplein to have some brunch which cost less for the both of us than the mercure charged for one person also we were very shocked when the taxi pulled up at the hotel as we didn t realise that it was out in the middle of nowhere the petrol station next door being the only other building around
