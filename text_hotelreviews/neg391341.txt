well if it wasn t for this debacle i would have given the hotel a star rating but unfortunately there are far too many hidden charges which neither booking nor mercure hotel tells the customer about i will warn you that it might be a long read but nevertheless it s important that people hear about it so they won t face the same misfortune as i upon checking in despite having paid the hotel three months in advance they made me pay twice without neither giving me a form or any kind of paper where there is any type of agreement that i will accept another payment pay close attention they ll ask you for your card because of a guarantee as they put it what will happen is that they ll charge your card again for the same price you booked the room and an additional euros i unfortunately found out about it when i noticed i couldn t use the atms anymore because of this unethical practice when talking to the staffers i was told that this is an authorization and not a payment well what they don t understand is that the funds are frozen since they are reserved and the customers are not able to use them meaning that if you travel on a tight budget well prepare for the worst if you re checking in here it doesn t take them more than a second to take the money but returning it seems like an impossibility at this point i was told by three different staffers that they have released the authorization at three different points in time and they are still frozen i will have to wait at least a week more before i file a report for fraud against this hotel
