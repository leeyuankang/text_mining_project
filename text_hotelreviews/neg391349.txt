location the hotel will give you the bus time table for the and they are very frequent it costs return to leidesplein but two times we had a problem with driver and we had to pay eur per person for one way i would recommend getting a bus tram travel card to avoid such problems with some drivers and i also suggest hotel stuff to inform bus company about that problem some drivers want eur ow other drivers eur ow that is unnecessary problem when you are on holiday
