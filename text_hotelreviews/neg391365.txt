i was appalled to find that the hotel doesn t have baths i d specifically chosen it from the images on your website which showed baths because i need a hot bath each evening to ease arthritis pains i should point out i m not old just unlucky also the cost of breakfast at euros is shocking and certainly not worth the money this was a business trip for me and i will be recommending to my company that we don t use this service in the future
