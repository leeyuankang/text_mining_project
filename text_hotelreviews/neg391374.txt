how far away it was from city staff problems check in wasnt good the lady asked for more than we had confirmed on our booking i questioned it straight away and she said it is for an authorisation incase we wanted breakfast i then said to the lady we did not want breakfast so asked her to take it off so she reduced the amount but it was still euro more than expected but i did not question this as i thought that was a refundable deposit on the room i then put my pin in and paid for the room all was fine and we started our holiday the day after i happened to check our account to find that a further had been taken from my account without my pin or permission which surely is not legal i spoke to a manager about this and they said it was for an authorisation for breakfast even though i had already said i will not be using their facilities manager was not helpful at all and refused to give us the money and said we could check out that day and with it being bank holiday there no available hotels the manager said we would get a refund when we check out which i am still waiting for the hotel should not be advertising room only options as this is clearly not the case for this reason and how unhelpful the staff were i will not be staying here again which is a shame as it is a lovely hotel
