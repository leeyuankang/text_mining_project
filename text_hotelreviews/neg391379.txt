we didn t like been so far out from the centre it was a lot of travelling on buses and trams back and forth to the hotel plus we got a taxi back on the last night he screwed us big time told him where our hotel was he drove us around for ages brought us to the airport saying this was our stop we told him no he rang the website said he knew it he passed our hotel and brought us off on another direction when we told him he passed it he was getting mad that far as he was concerned our hotel was in the airport he tripped himself up a few times cause he did know where it was he told us before we got him then he put us on meter topped up over we eventually got to our hotel we had a big argument we weren t paying that much he said it was all our fault he is a taxi driver he ment to know where all the hotels are located we still had to pay him plus we got a taxi the night before he had no problem bringing us straight to our hotel so i would advise not to get taxis but other than that we had a great weekend
