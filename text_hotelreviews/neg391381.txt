you need almost half an hour to get from the hotel to the city center using the bus not a big deal for us but it may be for others consider renting a car depending on your family group size it can even be cheaper then using the public transport we paid bus tickets and carried the luggage around meters to from the bus station instead of receiving the free airport transfer no one at the hotel had a driver s license they said apparently the designated driver only works in the morning and evening at check out they did the math and told us a sum that was more then we expected with almost euros it was a single bill for three rooms we showed them the booking prices reminded that for the weekend the breakfast is at half price and in the end we payed the correct amount
