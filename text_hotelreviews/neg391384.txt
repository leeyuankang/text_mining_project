everything in amsterdam is expensive but luckily there was a discount from the breakfast that weekend so it was okay prize would rather have a cheaper option than all the possible kinds of food that you may not even have time to eat or even can t fit in that much breakfast would be very good still even with less options it took quite a while to finish check in even we had already paid to get to the rooms since we didn t have much time to sleep and were already very tired would have been nice to just sing the papers and go i don t know what took so long in the morning we d just needed to get our luggage to be able to leave to the airport early on sunday morning but there was only one person working and lots of people by the desk luckily the driver of the shuttle waited and eventually he gave us the bags and didnt miss the flight wouldn t have put it there if we d known it takes ages to get them back as a customer server i would have given the bags and then answered tourists questions about transportation and attractions since there was a shuttle waiting for us
