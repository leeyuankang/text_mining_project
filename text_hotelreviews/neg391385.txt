the food and service in the restaurtant was terrible we ordered peking duck and it was definitely not worth the euros per piece extremely dry and not true peking duck also staff at the hotel was not very nice especially not for a four star hotel check out took forever and they first charged us with double the breakfast price if you do not come by car be aware that you have to cross a four line road to get to the hotel as there is a general lack of foot paths
