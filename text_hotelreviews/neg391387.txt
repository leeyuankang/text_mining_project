the only issue is to work out transport as there isn t much within walking distance the best option if staying at this hotel is to get the bus to and from the hotel or from the airport the bus stop is not far from the hotel and the buses are frequent then get the bus back to the airport and get the train from schiphol airport every time you want to go into amsterdam central getting an amsterdam travel ticket is a cheap way to do this as it allows you access to all transport methods it sounds tedious but does not take long at all
