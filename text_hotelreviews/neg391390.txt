when asked the staff how to reach the city they advised me with a different bus from amsterdam main public transportation company gvb instead of the bus that doesn t go straight to the city centre but is included in the and days gvb travelcards and crosses many other tram lines headed for the city centre they only advised me about a different bus company connexxion red buses that indeed go to the centre but are not included in the travelcards and cost five euros one way stay clear of this if you don t want to spend return just for a bus ride when you can buy a travelcard that covers all trips on gvb also the toilet in the room did not have a fan taking rid of moisture and smells was quite hard lastly the access from the bus stop to the property is a bit inconvenient no clear road crossing and walking along cycling roads not very welcomed in the netherlands
