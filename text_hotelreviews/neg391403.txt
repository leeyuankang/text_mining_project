when we first arrived they said we had to have an extra in a bank account to have as a deposit which was very awkward for us we arrived late at night and wanted to go to the city so this delayed us even more meant one of our friends had they re money tied up with the bank so couldn t withdraw cash we was then told there was building work going on never heard anything like it we had to demand a room change cause the drilling from the builders was so loud at we couldn t hear each other speak never mind get some sleep also the wifi kept cutting out every seconds which was extremely annoying and the taxi s cost each journey to the city definetly the worst hotel experience i ve ever had even though the hotel room was nice and clean
