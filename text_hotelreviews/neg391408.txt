we had an unfortunate dining experience with a hamburger from the menu we asked for medium cooked since we were asked about this specifically by the waitress the hamburger appeared rare and raw inside we sent it back but it came back again raw inside and went back to the kitchen a second time finally we left the remaining raw flesh on the plate being too embarrassed to return the burger a third time the waitress offered a coffee or desert from the house but by that stage we had had enough to eat
