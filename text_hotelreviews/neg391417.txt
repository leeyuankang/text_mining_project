the second bed was faulty it collapsed in fact and could not be fixed because the wooden bars on the bottom were missing we reserved for four but didn t have enough towels and the second bed sofa was not prepared ahead of time we would like to know whether we can get part of the price restituted looking forward to hearing from you about this
