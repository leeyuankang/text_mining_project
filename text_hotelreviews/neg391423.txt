this is currently not a hotel but a construction site i was terroized from early morning and all day with unacceptable building noise while resting after a long trip and working in the room people were working all day i e with jackhammers in the adjacent rooms i asked for a room change but no silent room was available to make thinks worse i was overcharged i checked out in the evening since i had to leave very early flight and received an appropiate bill a day later the hotel made another charge without my concent in excess of booked price it s a terrible place don t punish yourself by booking here
