the hotel is currently undergoing renovations i was given a room that was connected to some pipe work upstairs but hotel staff did not check the condition of the pipes i had dirty water that contained metallic grit in my bath when i alerted reception i was asked to wait for a renovation worker to fix my problem he did this but asked me to keep on flushing the pipes and bath until the water runs clean if anything this should have been hotel staff duty yo do in the morning i heard another guest complaining indicating that many rooms were effected by this i had in fact drunk a glass of water on arrival and clearly am very likely to have drunk contaminated water i asked mercure management to contact me by email but they never did
