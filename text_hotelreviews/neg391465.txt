i thought the restaurant s menu was somewhat limited both in choices and prices however the food was good when they tell you the shuttle is first come first serve believe it i was there at for the shuttle but there is no sign in sheet or anything so while i was waiting inside with the blessing of staff who knew i was waiting people went outside and waited thus bumping me i made it onto the full shuttle but in think a reservation system for the seat shuttle would being peace of mind my only other thing is a little unusual i thought the tub was very narrow while trying to shower i had to turn sidewise the entire time and the glass shower door needed to be a few inches wider to keep water from going everywhere again not big deals just little inconveniences
