we stayed at a number of other mercure hotels during our recent trip and this hotel is a blight on their chain definitely the worst mercure we ve ever stayed in the lift is a disgrace and has to be experienced to be believed it is halfway down a long and narrow ground floor corridor and is the size of a shoe box with non automatic closing doors the addams family would be right at home in this lift the overall feel of the hotel is that demolition would be a kind renovation the only thing that saves it is the location close to the airport service is ordinary and the breakfast is overpriced do yourself a favour and catch an earlier flight so you don t have to stay there
