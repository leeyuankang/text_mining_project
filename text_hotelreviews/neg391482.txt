rude staff even the manager i sent the message to the hotel via booking com app that we will arrive late after midnight there was no response but i assumed that everything is fine as hotel states working reception we arrived to the hotel at after midnight and met the person on duty hasim he looked bit lost and informed us that our reservation was cancelled half a day ago because there was some payment problem there was no information via e mail or via booking com app that they had any issue i asked and what about my e mail didn t you read it he said that they had no time to check messages and couldn t explain why they cancelled reservation without informing me he said that he has only one available room in the hotel and offered it to us with a higher price than originally booked i didn t agree and asked for a manager there was some dutch guy wil who was acting as a manager but he was useless as well they bot said that i need to pay new higher price for the room it took hour for us to get the room in this hotel remember hotel is in the middle of nowhere and it was at night otherwise i would be definitely going to another place the most ridiculous thing is that after hour dispute we received the room and breakfast for the original price at the end while in the beginning hasim and will were telling that this is completely impossible i would dismiss such customer unfriendly staff if i were the manager of this hotel
