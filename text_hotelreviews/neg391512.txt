the description says the hotel is min ride by bus from central station and that s not true it takes min with more than change there is nothing close to eat we tried to take the shuffle the hotel offers to the airport we were the ones waiting but off course slower because of our kid at the end the other guests took our place and the driver was really rude with us it did not mather we were waiting longer at the reception they told us that the are not school teachers to take care of the people they offer a service but they have no organization or control we had to take an expensive cap that we had to pay another hotel without transfer to the airport but lower in price is a better option if you value service treatment our kid was totally scare by the way they spoke to us
