the check in process was not great did not feel very welcome we were made to sit and wait and then told the room wouldn t be ready for another hour the toilet bathroom in the room was very smelly like dirty drains we were room royal suite which is directly opposite the lift just a metre away so can be very noisy with people chatting wardrobe space is limited for such a large room better use could me made of the two empty cupboards currently doing nothing under the stairs of above there was no hot water one morning albeit they had it back on a short time later breakfast was not included although we paid euros for x night stay we had breakfast one morning and it wasn t all that just a bit of bread and cheese and a few bits and bobs they could surely throw this in as included in such a high room rate
