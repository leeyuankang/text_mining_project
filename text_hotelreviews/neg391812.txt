the housekeeping forgot to clean our room two times the first time when we came back at around and found no one cleaned our room then call reception and i was told housekeepers already left so no housekeeper can clean our room finally the hotel sent two management people came to our room and did some cleaning even though in my hotel life is the first time that i come back with a dirty room and heard hskp are already left before it still can be tolerated however the second day when i back to hotel at around entered my room and found the room haven t been cleaned again even the management people felt so shamed and offered us a new room and two complimentary breakfasts immediately the only thing i can say is that this is so ridiculous and unacceptable for a five star hotel by the way first night when i arrived no slipper in the room and i was told there is no more slippers left in the hotel anymore and wait for tomorrow breakfast need to be improved as well nothing to eat
