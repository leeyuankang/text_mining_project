the establishment is very nice the room very spacious and very well equiped the staff very polite and helpful but in my case the airconditioning was not working in heat mode the receptionist tried to make it work but after failing did not change the room for us although i insisted on the matter so we were left to spent our night deep into the bed covers with the help of a tiny air heater but that was only the beginning of our problems since at am a guest was trying to get into the room by banging on the door and shouting that happens you would say but he only left to return with a hotel employee who also tried to get into the room that was a first since there is no fisheye on the door i thought i would call the police but after half an hour they eventually went away whomever they were definitely a night to remember but for the wrong reasons to their defense the next morning the overpriced breakfast was offered for free
