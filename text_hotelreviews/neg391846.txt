despite it being a very quiet canal side location the hotel through the night was very noisy heavy fire doors were constantly banging all the way through to the early hours as for the luxury suite it was nice but we booked the standard suite and at best it was a junior suite with kitchen facilities that would be handy if you were there for a prolonged stay the bathroom was small large shower though but no bath the view was non existent it was the floor and looked straight into a brick wall at euros for nights it was expensive for what we had despite the price no breakfast which i m glad i didn t book self catering star or star usa motel style
