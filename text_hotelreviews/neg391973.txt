too expensive for what the hotel has to offer poor quality service and facilities that were disappointing the plugs in my room didn t work for example and the water does not get very hot only mild staff was not very effective at solving these problems location is also bad because it is only truly close to the red light district everything else worth seeing is at least mins walk away and the public transfer trams don t go that close to the hotel
