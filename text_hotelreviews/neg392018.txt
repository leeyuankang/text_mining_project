the very worst bit tiny room cramped and stuffy matched only by an even tinier bathroom no room for a bath just room for a very small shower the toiletries appeared to be rationed and this was a superior room it was a special week end to treat my partner on his birthday i was disappointed no one there to greet us and i had to drag my own suitcase up the steps the courtyard was a building site we looked out onto it from the room and also at breakfast a bit rich to charge us full price it ought to have been a fabulous week end in a wonderful building it missed genuine luxury on so many levels
