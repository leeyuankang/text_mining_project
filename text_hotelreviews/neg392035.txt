both early mornings we were rudely woken up by very heavy hammering which sounded like builders knocking out bathroom floor tiles in the room above us which really disturbed our rest but the biggest disappointment was that the hotel staff denied that any building work was ongoing in the hotel whilst outside a builder and plumber van were parked we paid for each night for a suite overlooking the canal the heavy noise spoilt our stay
