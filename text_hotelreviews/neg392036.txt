the manager promised to change the room for us after the room was flooded and soaking wet with rainstorm they offered us a bottle of coke and beer with some bowls of nuts instead i had to stay in that room for nights and the worse thing appeared on the third night the air conditioning broke down the housekeeping came up to my room and promise to fix it but unsucessfully at we had to call the hotel security to check and fix it we didn t want to make our stay turning ugly so we simply let it be anyway that was the last night of our stay at this hotel and probably we will never return
