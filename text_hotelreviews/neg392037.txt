unfortunately the main entrance was closed having repairs done and there was a crane removing an airconditioning unit when we arrived so our driver could not get near the entrance we had to lug our suitcases across the canal the restaurant was closed and service in the outdoor restaurant was very slow so all in all not the best experience of the hotel
