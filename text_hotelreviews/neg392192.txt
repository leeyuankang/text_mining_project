restaurant service was slow and food quality not that great maybe they were having an off day the room service only offered burger type food which put me off but the hotel itself is fabulous and you can reach all the central amsterdam restaurants easily there s construction going on next door and my room faced straight onto construction workers and machinery doing their stuff woke me up on a bank holiday day so ask for a room away from all that
