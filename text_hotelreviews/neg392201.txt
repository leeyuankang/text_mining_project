would be nice to provide a toothbrush and toothpaste while the other perks of the room are nice i definitely needed a toothbrush more than music when i first got there and it s a ferry trip to the nearest shops i would probably not request the car from the airport next time it is really easy to get there by train and then ferry and much cheaper
