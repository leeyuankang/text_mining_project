the rooms were not very clean there were hairs on the toilet seat on the floor some pieces of plastics stuck to the walls in the room etc i have put the do not disturb sign on the door but when i came back the cleaners had entered the room without paying attention to the sign and made our room still didn t clean it properly though the rooms were very basic view was not good at all i have asked the hotel to book a taxi for the airport and the taxi has added to the amount on the meter and said when the hotel calls us we add this charge i think the hotel should have mentioned that to me
