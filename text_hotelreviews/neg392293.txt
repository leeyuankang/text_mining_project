the hotel is in a reseidential area surrounded by apartments and view from room was lines of laundry hotel has star rating but i think star would have been generous rooms was basic single beds with laminate flooring small wardrobe and no drawers for storage bathroom had walk in shower with screen but no door and floor got very wet after shower shower tray was so slippy it caused one of us to fall toilet was in bathroom but stangely wash hand basin was in bedroom i do not know what kind of designer thought that toilet and wash hand basin should be separate basin unit took up substantial space in room that could have accomodated a set of drawers towels were grey and thin cleaning was cursory both before we arrived and during stay on arrival there was a former occupant s dirty face cloth in bathroom gross lifts and one broken on two days bedroom hallways dirty had to seek out staff for service in bar in evenings not worth price and certainly i will not be recommending or returning
