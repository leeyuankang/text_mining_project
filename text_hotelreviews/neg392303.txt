nothing special about the hotel not sure why it was rated on booking com very average room though we were given a family room with extra beds located opposite lift shaft so noise well into the night as people arrived and left small child bouncing ball in room above somewhat irritating immediate area had people sleeping rough and drinking in nearby play park but nothing threatening
