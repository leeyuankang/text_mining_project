the description of the hotel made it sound like it was in a really nice area it was very local full of homeless people beggars and people drinking on the streets every time you went to walk out you was approached by these people it wasn t anywhere near barcelona port which it said it was i asked for a high rise room in which i thought with being next to the port i would have a lovely view our view was situated next to high rised local flats so was no nice views at the time of booking the hotel price was and when i got there i got charged wasn t happy about that at all breakfast in the morning scrambled egg had black streaks running through it i had put some on my plate to take to my table when i sat down the stench of small that was coming from it was disgusting i told the lady that was working in the seating area she removed it back into the kitchen i have taken pictures of the egg it was disgusting so basically i paid for two breakfasts for two of us for eating crossunts and orange juice i wouldn t reccomend this hotel based on value for money or the area food was awfull sorry
