the ac was not working had to talk to staff multiple times to get it working fine the bathroom for the deluxe room did not have a sink inside it was in the bedroom area the lobby smelled like chlorine due to the spa being open underneath staff at the lobby mistook me for not having paid my stay beforehand during booking so double check with them always also taxi drivers weren t familiar with the hotel or its location so always carry the address with you at all times
