the room we were given first time was very small the sink was in the bedroom and not in the bathroom we walked past another room on the same floor which was very large and spacious which were what the pictures showed online but we didn t expect the room to be as small as it was the breakfast wasn t great there was a lack of variety of food the scrambled eggs were watery and there wasn t much of an option for those who do not like to eat meat for breakfast the croissants were lovely but they ran out very quickly and the waiting time did take a while for a new load to come out but there is a cafe right next door to the hotel which is cheaper than the price for a breakfast in the hotel so definitely check the breakfast list before paying for it in the hotel they have a small spa downstairs but you have to book a time slot for it and pay but we weren t aware that you had to pre book to use the pool there is a big difference in what you receive from the basic room to the terrace room with the basic room you do not get robes or slippers and get a couple towels however with the terrace room you were provided with double the amount of towels robes and slippers
