spa seems bigger at the pictures sauna didn t work hamman was not really hot when you leave the spa the air is pretty cold due to air condition since we couldn t get into our room before we went to the spa where we got with pleading towels i booked a massage and after we got changed for the massage i bit for a dry towel since the others were wet and we didn t get one in the evening we wanted to have dinner in our room the room service menu was from a local pizza delivery so i called the reception nobody from room service picked up the phone to get a menu from the restaurant after waiting and more calles that left unanswered neither reception nor room service picked up by that time we decided to went downstairs at the restaurant was only waiter really stressed and told us for room service you have to order at the restaurant and after that they ll bring it up i was surprised because reception didn t give us this information we stayed at the restaurant where not even music was playing the food was ok but definitely not for the next time we ll have dinner outside
