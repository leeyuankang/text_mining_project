the value rating vs money that you get cannot be acceptable for a hotel we were given a room for a single that the adjective tiny does not represent how small it was transformed to get a couple in a star hotel that is far from acceptable after complaining twice since the first time they got us another tiny room we finally got the expected room the images of the hotel s rooms are far from being the real deal a disappointing experience
