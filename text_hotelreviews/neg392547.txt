the short brunette female staff member who dealt with my check in was straight off the bat abrupt and rude from the get go to describe her there is another lady that looks almost identical to her at reception she constantly looks pissed off too every country i have been to you reserve and pay at check out and i found it quite bizarre that this is the first booking com hotel where i had to pay at check in that s fine but i did not find it pleasant how the staff member repeated sir you have to pay now multiple times and then say on booking com it says you have to pay at check in no it does not i looked in your hotel s terms and conditions and it mentions that there is a deposit and that i will have to show my passport with a credit card on arrival for id no pay at check in on booking com to top all of that off she gave me no information about the hotel whatsoever she gave me the card for my room as well as my receipt and that was it i didn t know what time the breakfast started or ended i had to come back and ask i didn t know anything at all about the spa which btw you have to pay per day to use she charged my card without asking me this is where the argument arose from she did not make me feel welcome whatsoever and from reading comments left by various others the female members of staff are really rude in this s place and they don t make you feel welcome it s a shame because it s relatively well situated with taxis just outside and a metro minutes away and it s very stylish the wi fi however is shockingly bad in all areas of the hotel you can just about connect yourself to facebook right across the street there is a nightclub which will play loud bassy music until in the morning so for a family maybe this isn t the best option but the soundproofing is very good it s just the bass
