cabs worked out very dear for our trip there is a metro close i believe but we did not use it and spent about on cab journeys to from the parties round the city for off sonar airport cab was but they made us pay minimum charge the hotel arranged a cab back for us for room you immediately walk in to the bathroom the wardrobe bath sink toilet and shower are all as you walk in we traveled as friends and this was rather strange as doors were glass so you could see them bathing etc maid did not top up the toilet roll in days some clean towels were stained with what looked like nail polish of our dirty towels was not changed for a while terrible long thin pillows only plug socket on side of the bed and not mine area very limited facilities near by beach minute walk could be difficult to get a taxi from this poston most days hardly anywhere to walk for food just cafe style baguette places really poor quality mini marts i would suggest walking minutes over to el poblenou as there was a vast variety of food and shops in this area walk to la ramblas area took us a fair while but was doable
