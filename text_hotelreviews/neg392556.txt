tea bags and bottles of water in room on arrival but not replenished on a daily basis on our last afternoon evening the pool area was closed for a music event that went on until m no notice of this was given and the sound reverberated throughout the hotel and we were informed this event was on for three days so we were glad to be leaving when we did the surrounding area needs improving but ideal if you want to stay somewhere quieter
