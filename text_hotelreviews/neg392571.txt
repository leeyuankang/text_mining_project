i asked for a room with internet working well since it was my business trip i sent inquiries times for this noone never replied so once i checked in i realised that they gave me room at the very end of the corridor without wifi connection at all after my claim they changed the room but it doesn t work much more better but finally i had wifi in the room bathroom building to be refurbished in very near future the rooms especially rooms very small to some rooms you are not entering to the hall but to the bathroom directly
