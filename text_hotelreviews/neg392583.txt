the hotel is overpriced and we definitely did not get our money s worth as a former spa therapist who previously worked in a four star spa it was by no means up to four star standards we were charged for an item from the mini bar that we did not consume we did not realise this until we left for the airport to go home i thought this act was greedy as we already had spent a substantial amount from staying at the hotel the food is very mediocre and portion sizes are minimal the vast majority of staff were the biggest let down as in my opinion friendly staff play a vital role in an enjoyable stay even down to asking staff for directions they were unhelpful and we were lucky to get a greeting from them at times we did not enjoy our stay purely because of the fact we did not feel comfortable staying there as we felt very unwelcome all in all i would not revisit this hotel and i would definitely not recommend it
