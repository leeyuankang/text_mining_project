where do i begin when i booked the hotel on booking com i didn t see that the hotel adds room tax to your room in addition to what you have already paid and this is charged to your room on checkout the language barrier is an issue if you don t speak english as the staff behind reception and the spa staff were rude the restaurant food was terrible and apart from the spinach starter everything else was disgusting our group paid in cash for the dinner and the waiter still added the price of the food to the bill barcelona is overpriced in general and when our group went to pacha they charged things on the bill that we didn t have so make sure to check the bill the area is also a little noisy and the decor outside of the hotel is poor the hotel is also in a poor location i would recommend staying in catalunya as it is a better area and is near the shops and cathedral
