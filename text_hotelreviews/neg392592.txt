the biggest disappointment was the housekeeping sadly it was very poor it is the little things like topping up the tea making facilities in the room and ensuring there were clean cups would have been nice as well as a fresh bottle of water you aren t provided with any coffee or milk either sadly the drinking glasses were not changed for the week we were there until i asked or washed them myself there is no other restaurants or areas of interest in the local area of the hotel
