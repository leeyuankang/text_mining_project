spa staff cordial but generally unfriendly somewhat apathetic and assertively authoritative especially about rushing everyone out by closing also the spa pool always seemed murky and looked like it needed a cleaning and the hot tubs were generally lukewarm cleaning staff very nice but sometimes over looked things all considered the pros definitely outweigh the cons here i look forward to returning try to include a visit to sitges a lovely beach town on the mediterranean during your visit to barcelona
