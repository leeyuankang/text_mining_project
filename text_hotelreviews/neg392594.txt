booking com listing hotel as the a c is available however it wasn t available because barcelona at the moment is on winter time despite the fact that it was in middle of march and it was up to degrees outside moreover to use the pool not the spa facilities you need to pay eur per day per person this is just ridiculous also the room basically wasn t the cleanest one which i ve seen loads of dust and dirt in the corners my friends had to swap the room because originally they ve been given room which wasn t serviced after previous customer later in other room they also have found somebodies hair in the bed
