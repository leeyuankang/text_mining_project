the rest of the hotel did not match the room at all the food was really horrible and the spa although a good sauna was not that great as well as this the gym was pretty pathetic the location i reckon would be perfect in summer as it s so easy to get to the beach and not at all far to get into the centre the only downfall was that there isn t anything in the area to do we had to always travel to have drinks and food
