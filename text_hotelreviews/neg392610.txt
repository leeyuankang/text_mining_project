food in the main restaurant wasn t a great standard i ordered a steak and the waitress didn t ask how i would best like it cooked staff didn t speak a great deal of fluent english which made our experience of the tourist attractions rather poor the location and surroundings were rather run down which was a real shame as the hotel was really nice and modern
