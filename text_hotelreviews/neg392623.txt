the females at the front desk seemed very passive almost rude was not very welcoming and not very helpful when i had questions i have not had this experience anywhere else in barcelona they seemed to only speak catalan not very much spanish and next to nothing english the rooms were very hot the first room i was in had a clogged sink and would have a random puddle of water from an unknown source the second room was nice but still very hot i had to keep the windows open at night to cool down the room yes i have adjusted the thermostat in the room i did not have a good experience staying here and would not recommend it to anyone
