what was a good location for me as i was here to attend a gig at razzmatazz may not be so good for others this is an industrial part of town with a lot of noise in the streets late at nights as clubs open close also i was out of the room from until with a please clean my room sign displayed but this didn t happen even though housekeeping were in the room next door as i left
