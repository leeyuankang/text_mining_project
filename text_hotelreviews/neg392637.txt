customer service is pretty poor we arrived at the hotel in a taxi with our little daughter asleep and i was unloading the luggage from the taxi the concierge looking at us as i was bringing in the luggage to the reception desk but did not offer to help with the luggage until the last bag was left we asked for a change of sheets as we arrived and we had to spread the sheets ourselves without the service from the hotel staff we booked a double room but were given a twin room next morning when we complained the room was changed but nobody came to help us with the shift thankfully the two room were on the same floor many other instances including being charged euros room service charge for just ordering a glass of milk for our little daughter also the guy at the bar did not look pleased to give us more milk
