the hotel and all the facilities are great but the location leaves a lot to be desired the area seems to be a fairly run down part of barcelona with lots of poor quality graffiti and poorly maintained buildings some of the graffiti around barcelona is very artistic and appears to be encouraged there were a couple of bar restaurants very close to the hotel but sitting outside them in the evening was challenging due to the fairly frequent waft from the drainage the view from hotel windows is either in to the hotel garden pool area which is fine or at ugly buildings if you face the other way our view was of the petrol station and taxi rank which didn t really bother us because we spent most of our time out and about with our friends
