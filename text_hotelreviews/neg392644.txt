we were a group of couples spending a round of drinks we had an issue with a bar tender that decided it was ok to serve our group half pints of froth and charge us full price when asked to fill them up he told us that was how they were poured in barcelona i complained to the manager but nothing was done so after spending over in the bar we moved to the tavern across the road and spent or so to a more deserving bar i complained again on saturday morning and was told that no one or nothing could be done until monday when the gm was back in we spent the rest of our weekend eating and drinking out in the surrounding taverna s spending around each time so your loss
