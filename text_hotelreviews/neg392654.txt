the lounge was located by the reception and was rather like sitting in a goldfish bowl as the front of the hotel was entirely of glass the set of white leather chairs were a bit off putting not good for sitting and relaxing this modern hotel is located in a rather run down semi industrial looking area and it is quite a walk to the beach
