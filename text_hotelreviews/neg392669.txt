room was very warm at night we were certain air con was not working as it should our friends room was ice cold in comparison we explained to reception and reply was simply that its been tested and is working other advice was to simply swap with my friends room completely ignoring the inconvenience this would cause our friends no offer of swapping rooms in generally all staff at reception not great attitude wise on our entire trip only member of staff said have a nice day outdoor swimming pool very small especially as in pics it looks big not worth overall
