not being able to use the facilities due to a music event for many days for which i will be making a complaint which lasted from till this also meant it was not viable to use the restaurant due to the racket the same applied to being able to use the spa our days were organised where possible to avoid being in the hotel during these hours i felt sorry for the staff who were on duty as this music was a constant base beat which was very wearing and annoying whilst being repatative i feel some type of recompense should be made
