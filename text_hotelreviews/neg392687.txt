the outdoor pool and gym are almost nothing both is too small when i checked in they gave me a room near the road first floor and near the road i was feeling the buses inside my room and i found some tobacco ashes on the bed and some tobacco on the table however the staff was very helpful and they changed my room which was totally better than the first one
