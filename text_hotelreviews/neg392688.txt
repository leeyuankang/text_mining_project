it s not really a four star hotel to me the swimming pool was closed for pool parties that went on til late and were really noisy we couldn t order room service from our room and instead had to go down to the bar to order food wasn t great tasting and cold we were on a non smoking floor but people were still smoking on our floor the first day we arrived we had no electricity until midnight so couldn t use our room two of the three lifts were out of service so overall a lot of negatives it depends what you re looking for if you just want a room in a good location it s better value for money than the other hotels but if you want a pool room service and generally spend more time at the hotel i would pay the extra money to stay at the better hotels neighbourhood felt run down and a bit daunting but didn t experience any trouble
