the staff on the front desk especially someone called daniel we very rude and unhelpful we asked for an iron and he just said they couldn t provide an iron with no explanation could have been better also i booked this room for myself and my wife the room was supposed to be a double instead we got single beds pushed together which wasnt ideal
