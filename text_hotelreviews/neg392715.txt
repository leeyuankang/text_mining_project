spa centre became a joke in this hotel it was a really great place with very nice facilities i m not even talking about a bathrobe and slippers which they used to have before this time i did not get even a towel and when i asked for a locker key i was told that they don t have any keys left and that i can change myself and bring my clothes over to the spa reception so they keep it there for me the spa itself was overcrowded with families and children despite the fact that they have a notice on the wall stating that kids are allowed into spa area only between it was pm but never mind the hotel is in great location i ve been here for many times now i like the proximity of the subway and the beach but the spa is the real let down in my last trip i don t think i will ever use it again as it was hard to enjoy the facilities without having a towel
