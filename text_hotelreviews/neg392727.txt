needs air conditioning sorting out i know its a spa hotel but i wasn t expecting to have a sauna every time we entered our room bed was comfy but the lack of aircon made sleeping awful make sure you drink plenty of spanish rioja before bed i asked the maintenance guy to fix our aircon and to be fair i don t speak much spanish and he certainly didn t speak any english but through me pointing at the nice shiny siemens a c controller on the wall and him shaking his head from left to right whilst pointing to the window we managed to come to an understanding whereby basically he was advising me that for cold air i need to open the window and that the hotel didn t have any air conditioning installed the spa is nice but it could be better with regular maintenance as only of the wet area facilities were working during our short stay spa also needs to include the use of either robes in the rooms or include the use of the changing facilities when you consider that we booked a hotel spa package and had to come down to the spa to collect our towels then go back up to the room to change and subsequently return to the room in dripping wet swimwear once finished in the spa this small detail might also help them maintain a dry floor in the lobby and lifts oddly we noticed that they do have changing facilities in the spa but these we only for use by the locals using the spa not for hotel guests finally you will need a taxi to get around from here if this is your base but with a taxi always seemingly to be waiting across the road it wasn t too much bother just additional expense
