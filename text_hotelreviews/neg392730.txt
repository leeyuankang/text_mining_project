a c didn t work as it should on both cool and heat settings any fan speed and no matter what the thermostat setting the a c would always blow hot air which made it impossible to use the fan at night to cancel out the street noise i understand that the cooling feature may be off in april to conserve energy but it should be possible to just use the fan without the heating the keycard worked erratically especially in the elevators about of the time resetting at reception did not help noise from the street i asked for the back yard room but this request was ignored i got two single beds despite selecting a double bed not a major issue for me but still the hotel charged to the card used at reservation so i lost on conversion charges i would have preferred to pay the complete amount on check out the staff did not inform me that the outside pool was open the description indicated that it was closed in april so i lost the opportunity of using it the immediate neighbourhood is rather depressing and shabby mostly car repair garages
