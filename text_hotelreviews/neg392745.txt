the room was really small the shower cabin was right in the room next to the entrance door facing a window which was quite unusual the shower cabin leaked every time so water was all over the room the cleaning ladies were accurate and fast but after cleaning they never put my stuff back like they would leave my bathroom bottles on a deep shelf where i would never think of looking or place my suitcase in the middle of a room the neighborhood is quite troublesome it was quite frightful to walk in the streets at night there s no decent supermarket nearby average wifi
