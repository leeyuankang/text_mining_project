unwelcoming staff at the reception i was early for check in so i wanted to use the spa in the meanwhile included in the booking i queued for the main reception and i was told to go directly there the woman didn t even look carefully at my confirmation at the spa reception after queueing again i was told i needed tickets so had to go back to the main reception after queueing again where i explained this ridiculous situation and no apologies were made i genuinely think the receptionist wasn t able understand what i was saying in english after check in we went to our room and there where hair all over the bed we asked to change room and for the manager to come to check the new one together with us there were hair on the bed of the second room too we asked for any sort of benefit to recover such an uncomfortable situation for a stars hotel but they were totally refused cleaners came to re do the bed it was clear that the hotel staff didn t really consider this matter a concern which was really disappointing after checkout we left our luggage in the storage room when we came back after few hours one was missing the hotel staff struggled to help us as if this was not a big deal they just mentioned they might have an insurance but they didn t know the details it was clear they didn t know their policy to deal with this type of event it has been really frustrating and such a bad way to end our holiday not considering the loss of money
