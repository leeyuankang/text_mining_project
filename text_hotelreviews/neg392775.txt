staff there were really nice receptionists who even upgraded us as we were on our honeymoon and pretty horrible receptionists spoke very rudely to a client wasn t so helpful and was sending bad vibes in general the pool is to cold to swim in i feel like a paid a lot for a hotel that s not up to the standers it thinks it is there was no doorman to take our stuff to the room i had to ask as our bags were really heavy the suit was nice but iv e seen bigger and better another thing we came early so we gad to store our bags until check in they kept giving the gusts the keys to the bag storage room instead of keeping the keys to themselves and keeping check of all of the bags i was really mad at that and just felt like my belongings aren t safe
