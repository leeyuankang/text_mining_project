the location though relatively close to the beacht min walk is in an industrial area no much attractions close by access to spa i e the little pool and sauna is limited to only once hour this was very misleading to us since we expected an unlimited access as with other hotels we had to beg for extra vouchers to get to the pool shampoo and coffee sachets were not periodically replaced everyday we had to call and remind them twice during our stay wifi reception in the room was very poor had to move to the corridors and lobby in order to get connected
