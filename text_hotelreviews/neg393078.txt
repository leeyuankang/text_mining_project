the staff were unhelpful and inefficient we were staying for my friends pre wedding celebrations and every evening when we asked the staff to order taxi s for us they refused to even pick up the phone and inquire the taxi bay outside the hotel was vacant every evening and we were forced to run minutes to the marina because we thought the hotel would help us to book the taxi s for our group but they point blank refused and so we almost missed our boat party if you don t mind very poor customer service then spend your hard earned cash on your stay here it is an expensive hotel and the only thing good about it are the cleaning staff and modern rooms the gym facilities are poor treadmill was inoperative and only open until the spa does not allow you to wash with soap because of poor drainage however they do allow you to use the facilities if you have a late flight and want to freshen up also the hotel has a safe stowage area to keep your bags after you check out please bare in mind if your room is near the emergency exit as mine was you will be woken up every morning with a very loud jarring sound of what sounds like a service lift occupying a group of maintenance workers
