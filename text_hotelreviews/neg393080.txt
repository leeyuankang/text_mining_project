room climate control would not allow setting below c unfortunately it would not cool to that temperature and room stayed at about c although hotel was responsive to requests to check it we are accustomed to cooler temperatures indoors so that was a little problem however the hotel did make efforts to fix it we were only there three days so there may not have been adequate time for repair
