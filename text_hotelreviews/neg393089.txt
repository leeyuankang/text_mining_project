the hotel does not have the ideal location so i would suggest a bit of research beforehand if having to arrange travel from the airport for example taxi probably best if travelling with suitcases but as we only hand luggage we used the train metro which took about minutes but was very cost effective it s a good minute walk to catalunya square or to the port area but there are plenty of bars on route and the large park where the arc de triomf monument is situated is also within easy walking distance the bogatell metro station less than mins walk there is a cocktail bar next door to the hotel called which we found very good for food and drink
