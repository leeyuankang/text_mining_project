the staff were very rude tried to charge me another deposit on top of a deposit that were both never mentioned the deposit was because i was suspected of smoking and was told to pay this or and the speech trailed off but upon asking to see where in the paper work i had signed said this i was quickly told i heard wrong and i was not asked for a further deposit in the morning i asked another manager who said is was part of the hotel policy to ask for another deposit if suspected of smoking i then asked to see the policy which he said he cannot show the hotel policy to hotel residents and if i had a problem to take it up with the general manger on monday i am yet to ring the hotel manager but will very soon i feel like what i looked like was used to judge and was not left to our own devices at all
