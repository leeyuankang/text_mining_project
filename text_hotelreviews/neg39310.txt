the location is ideal for getting to the city but the view from both your room and the main areas is appalling from the restaurant you faced a graffiti wall the saturday evening whilst having our meal at the restaurant there was this continuous boom boom it transpired that there was a function on below us and they were sound testing this constant boom boom vibrated throughout the restaurant and we could still hear it on the forth floor it continued until at least whilst the food in the restaurant was tasteful again it was not what l would call special it had little choice for vegetarians the family room booked for people upon arrival only had cups glasses and other extras for whilst this may have been an oversight it clearly demonstrated that staff had not read the booking for adults the impression on photos of the room looked like two large double beds with plenty of room this was not the case and it was a tight squeeze for all the general value for money was a huge disappointment and l would not recommend this hotel for families or more than adults per room
