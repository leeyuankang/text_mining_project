although staff was kind and helpfull they seemed stressful and didn t make you feel warm the room service didn t clean the room as needed after the second day the floor was very dirty the noise isolation is very poor you can hear people taking shower or walking also the bar next to the hotel is very noisy until or am we could hardly sleep when it was crowded
