the hot breakfast buffet lacked options for vegetarians and you could not get eggs made to your preference or order an omelette there were plenty of pastries though the hotel did not look like it did in the pictures i stayed in a family room which was dated and the decor was of a low standard the bath contained rust stains and i had to be asked to move to another room this was by the lifts and the paper thin walls meant i was constantly disturbed at night by noise from the neighbours and guests using the lifts there are no irons in the rooms these have to be requested toiletries are also not replaced and again have to be requested
