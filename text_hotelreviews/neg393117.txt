we were on the floor staying with a two year old there is some noise from the road saturday night was the worst as there are some clubs nearby but after reading my husbands review online the manager rang us asking if we wanted to get moved to a higher floor we had less than left at that point so it wasn t worth it for us to pack and move the wardrobe doors slide and bang at the slightest move great fun for our year old but not so much for the neighbours could also hear other people s wardrobes banging add to that the doors to the room no soft closets on the doors mean you know whenever someone comes or goes on the floor the spa is nice enough with a square pool but not large enough for a swim they also only allow children in between the hours of and you only get one visit upto hour which on a day stay is not enough in my opinion with the price changed for the room
