the room needed a few things repairing the floor needed repairing as a panel from the wooden floor was loose and the extractor fan in the bathroom wasn t working also we were looking forward to the spa which is a reason why we stayed at the salles but what wasn t made aware was that you only had an hours free access to the spa and that you had to wear flip flops and wear a swimming hat if you wanted to go in the pool at a cost of euros per person
