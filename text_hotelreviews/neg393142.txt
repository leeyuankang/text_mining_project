i paid for a double room with access to the spa and when i got there they made us pay for plastic flipflops and for swimming hats even though they were not expensive i didn t like how they were imposed on us something along the lines of you have to buy or you don t get into the spa you could have included that cost into the room from the begining everywhere i ve been before i was provided with everything needed for accessing the spa also the spa facility itself is quite small and crowded and i ve seen people having arguments because they were taking each others flipflops the spa didn t offered the relaxing experience i was looking for also the bathrobes provided were ripped and quite in bad shape
