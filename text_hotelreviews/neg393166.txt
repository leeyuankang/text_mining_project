despite the hotel stating that wi fi was accessible in a majority of the areas of the hotel including hotel rooms we could not access wi fi satisfactorily and was either very slow or no access at all i found this quite disappointing and misleading on the hotel s behalf the wi fi seemed to work better once in the hotel reception lobby but for i m sure for most guests staying at the hotel it would be more convenient if adequate wi fi access was available from their own rooms too also the walls between rooms appeared to be quite thin as there were times that we could hear sounds walking shouting etc from other nearby guests
