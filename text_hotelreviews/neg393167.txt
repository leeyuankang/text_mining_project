arranged for shuttle to airport we thought next morning we were told the shuttle was not coming but we could take a taxi for same price front staff person arranged and said they would go with us but they did not they just sent us to taxi area there was confusion due to language barriers finally sorted out no thanks to hotel they knew we were english speaking they could have helped out but did not sour experience to end vacation overall hotel was just ok would not recommend to others
