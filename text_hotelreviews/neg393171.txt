the spa pool has no changing room people used the one toilet which was swimming with water as a result one morning i fell on the bathroom floor when stepping out of the bath shower the floor was marble and despite using the bathmat and holding the handle i still managed to slip the floor was actually quite wet from the shower i hurt myself and decided to report it to reception so they could take action to minimise the chance of a repeat by someone else the receptionist was fine and said she would tell her manager when he had finished with another customer i sat on a reception sofa and despite being there for no one approached me my family and i were leaving for sightseeing so i didn t wait any longer a very disappointing lack of response from the manager an acknowledgement of what had happened and some sympathy for my pain would have been the right response
