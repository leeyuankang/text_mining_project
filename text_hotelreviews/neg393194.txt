i booked with booking com and upon showing them my printed booking information the receptionist said it has been cancelled i mentioned to them what has gone wrong and proved them that it has been confirmed afterwards the staff didn t even tried to check or phone the booking com to confirm my reservation instead they asked us to pay in advance for the full payment of my reservation which contradicts the rules i have read in the policy of the hotel my family is tired at that moment thats why i didnt make any arguments about the situation hoping in the future the staff will try to learn how to resolve the matter which is fair on both sides of party and will be able to speak or discuss the problem among them in english rather than them speaking in spanish because its really rude
