hotel is situated in the industrial area that could scare initially but nothing really dangerous we have noticed even when we walking at back to hotel room had a bad smell due to the stale air in it which was not good even after good cleaning if windows are closed the bad smell will return you have to pay for safe and it is only could be locked by key so you have to carry key with you strange nowadays when all safes are code locked good flat screen tv in the room but really you cannot watch anything as there are no many channels even in english
