i stayed at salles hotel pere iv with my family from the of may to the a few days ago i sent a request to the hotel through booking com for an extra bed even though the request came through confirmed by booking com we were told at the hotel that they hadn t recieve any of such matter it was on short notice so i guess it was understandable we were asked to pay an extra euros extra for nights and we agreed to it when we checked out we saw that the price was a bit higher than expected never thinking a star hotel would do such a thing we only gave the hotel receipt a quick look didn t notice they had charged us euros per night for our extra guest and not so that s a euros burn on our side and plus on theirs i would recommend everyone to not make the same mistake as we did and allow this happen to you definitely not worth staying and i won t be returning there next time i visit barcelona
