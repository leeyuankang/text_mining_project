this is a non smoking hotel but our room smelt of cigarette smoke the staff worked very hard to get rid of this and did eventually succeed there were no coffee making facilities in the room and we had to ask many times before we got a kettle which were in limited supply you had to pay extra for wifi and although there was a safe in our room we had to pay extra to use it the location was alot further away from the city centre than we had imagined
