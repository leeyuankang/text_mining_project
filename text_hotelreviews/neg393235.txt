the breakfast was not the best the first day the scrabled eggs were so bad we couldn t eat a bite the boild eggs must have been boiled for minutes they were very hard and did not taste good the coffee machine was horrible neither the chocolate function or the capuchino function seem to work very well they both tasted the same the juice was not either of good quality and we scipped that all together
