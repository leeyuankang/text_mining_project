bedroom smaller than expected though adequate food just ok spa very poor with a tiny and barely tepid jacuzzi cool sauna small but good steam room and a pool too small to swim in all poorly laid out with difficult steps to negotiate and with no towels or changing facilities it explained the wet floors in the lifts which we noticed on arrival
