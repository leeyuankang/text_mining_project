they don t have toilet brush so for friends it s disgusting we were two guys and the welcome pack was for man and woman they don t know how to do a bed so it has lot of wrinkles the air conditioning just work to warm the room never to put it cold and the extraction in the bathroom is not working the dryer was cracked but working the sauna steam and other commodities are really small not all the team speak spanish at least i complained to them about the things above and when i came back no one told me if there is something fixed or not the cards doesn t have the room number so you need to have it in your mind so for a star hotel it seems like star there are hostels better than this hotel and airbnb s as well
