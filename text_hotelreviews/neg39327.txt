i have made a change to my reservation of which the reception staff was not aware of when i checked in i was then enquired more than once about the situation which was annoying to say the least rooms can get very hot and the air conditioning was the right above the bed so it is advisable to leave the air conditioning on when one s not in the room breakfast was good with very good quality of all the products i had but i would expect a lot more variety of products little choice of bread no bacon no scrambled eggs no beans didn t feel like i was in england while having breakfast i didn t get the desired value for the money i paid honestly
