the only negative with the room was there was no mirror outside of the bathroom a hairdryer is provided but it is secured in a drawer in the main bedroom so you have no alternative but to try and do your hair without a mirror there were tvs in the room but only was working not an issue for us as tv is sufficient anyway so we didn t even make the hotel aware of this
