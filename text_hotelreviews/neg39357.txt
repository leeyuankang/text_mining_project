the room was not remotely soundproof with windows closed could still hear all conversations laughter etc on the street also one can hear all of the doors dropping closed each morning temp control in the room seemed to go off sporadically and return to warm and a bit stuffy we did not feel confident in the area but would stay again if could have a room not facing the street as long as not alone while traveling to and from at night
