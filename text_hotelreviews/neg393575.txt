absolutely nothing bad to say about the hotel but booking com was not really there for us regarding a reservation error misunderstanding when we called booking com to find a solution to our problem we were left with our problem more or less alone the only alternative offered by booking com to split up and to acommodate half of out people family incl kids in another hotel in the redlight district nice alternative thanks to hampton again they offered more than hour of their time and went the extra mile to find the perfect solution for us
