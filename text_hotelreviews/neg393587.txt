on check out the hotel tried to charge me an extra euros due to an error they said was made when the payment was taken when i booked the hotel it said payment would be taken at the hotel on arrival although the money was taken just a couple of days after booking was placed the lady on the front desk told me that it was their error but i needed to pay the euros i refused and was then accused of being difficult and then she said that she d not speak to me any further i guess she just expected me to say yes that s fine and pay her all i did was question it and find that it was an error that they had made and not one that i had made i also said that they should have informed me of the error on check in not on check out which i believe would have been the correct way to deal with this issue
