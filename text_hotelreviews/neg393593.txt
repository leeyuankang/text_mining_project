not much that you can change i would however suggest that the location of the hotel be more clearly described i e the fact that it is not very close to the center of the city and accessible only by the tram line or the room was really small for the price so value for money the hotel gets a bad note the staff was mostly friendly and helpful though still on our next trip to amsterdam i doubt that we will stay here and certainly not use booking com next time
