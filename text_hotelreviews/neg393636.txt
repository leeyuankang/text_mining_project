the room very small booked king size bed but the bed in the room not even double size i would say size bed no bath tub i like to soak myself after a long day of sight seeing food very basic and seen staff touching food with no gloves beddings seems like they only change at the end of your stay they don t refill stuff like shower gel even though house keeping staff were in cleaning everyday got house keeping staff knocking and entering the room twice before ten for cleaning so you have to lock room at all times
