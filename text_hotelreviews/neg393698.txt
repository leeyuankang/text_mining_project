okay there was couple of things witch we didn t like the first thing was that you can t open the window we understand its for a safety reasons but still the room felt like there is no aer in it and the second thing was the cleanliness the day we arrived we got food from reception i must say the quality of the food was poor but what really annoyed us was that the plates wasn t taken off the room for the tree days we staid there was a cleaners coming in but all they ve done was tide up the bed and take away the towels and the plates was standing on the desk i think that wasn t proper cleaning service
