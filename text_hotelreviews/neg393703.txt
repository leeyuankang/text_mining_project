the only disappointment was the food i was excited with kids to have breakfast included the eggs were undercooked and the bacon was still raw seriously raw we tried ordering a small snack for the kids after a long day out and the chips for the nachos were stale i know hotels aren t there for the food but these three things were exceptionally poor
