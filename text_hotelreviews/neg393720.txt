we had ordered and prepaid a twin room when we arrived we were told there were no twin rooms available and we were offered a heavily sub par cot as a substitute being too tired to make a fuss we accepted with the understanding that we could switch to a twin the next day then we were woken up way too early considering our check in time and told that we d have to vacate the room before and not be able to check into a new one before we declined went back to sleep and then in the afternoon managed to wrangle the room shift anyways this is now the third time in a row that i book a twin room at an upscale hotel chain and have this exact problem both booking com and the hotels are to blame here when i book a twin room i want a twin room especially when i have payed a week in advance on a non refundable room it should be self evident that in most cases just sticking people in doubles instead could be heavily infringing on peoples personal space i will be sending a separate email to booking com customer service to get their act together regarding these kind of bookings
