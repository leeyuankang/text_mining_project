i had the room number this is an executive room there are lots of generators in front of the window so it will be difficult to get a good sleep because of the noise also you will not find a heater the room includes only an air conditioner the machine is very noisy it doesnt matter if you select the smooth or high program the air will be blown right in your face while you are lying on the bed also very distracting is a green light above the door inside the room which can not be switched off
