the first room we were put in was on the first floor on the street side i didn t get a wink of sleep because it was so noisy outside also the air conditioning wasn t working in this room so it was very uncomfortable we asked for a double room but got two single beds i asked for this to be dressed as a double bed for my wife and i and was assured by reception that room service would do so the following day when we returned to the room after a day at a business outing like a zombie from lack of sleep we found the bed was still dressed as two single beds when i called down to mention these issues we were moved to the floor not on street side so hopefully a better sleep no such luck the air conditioning was still not working in this room and it was smaller than the first room at least we had a double bed the walls were paper thin so we heard the people in the room next door when they stumbled in at the morning we were due to check out there was no hot water in the bathroom when we rang reception to mention the issue and that we had to shower before leaving the staff member seemed to laugh about it and say we can bring our stuff down to the first floor and shower there just not a great experience overall and not even worth half the money that i paid for this one of the worst hotel experiences that we have had
