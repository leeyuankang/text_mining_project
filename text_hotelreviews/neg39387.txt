when i first checked in they attempted to charge me more than the reservation was confirmed for and when i arrived in the room it had a rather bad odor both issues resolved themselves but are worth noting there was a tube strike while i was there and the staff wasn t very knowledgeable about what was happening they tried to convince me to take a taxi to the airport but i found out on my own the tube would be running at that time making the taxi unnecessary and a much longer and more expensive means of transport
