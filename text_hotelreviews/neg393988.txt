we booked this hotel for three nights for the new year dec january the price was high for the hotel outside the ring but this was expected for the holiday period i specifically emailed the hotel after booking the room and asked for a quiet and renovated room otherwise i would not book they responded that they will provide a quiet room however when we arrived we were provided with a very noisy room right next to the elevator and with window facing the wall of the opposite building as the room was tiny the bed was essentially right next to the elevator wall you can hear elevator well the room was also very dated we asked to change to a quieter room and the reception was not very nice and helpful the lady started telling us that the room is quiet while we could hear the elevator well at the end they agreed to wait more than an hour in the lobby in order for them to change our room not very nice attitude by the staff they could not even recommend a good place to eat overall this hotel is outside the center at least min walk to the opera and walk to the stephansdom the rooms are tiny and interior is very dated the breakfast was very average this is not a star quality more like a three star average hotel well overpriced for the quality
