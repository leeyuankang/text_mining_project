the biggest issue for me and my group with this hotel is the fact the staff do not appear to have a good command of english and this was hugely frustrating not only did we stay but we had a huge meeting there with them too it was starting to drive us insane them not understanding simple instructions from us forgetting refreshments etc there is a lack of attention to detail at this hotel too and i do think the language barrier plays a big part in this for this reason alone i sadly will not be coming back
