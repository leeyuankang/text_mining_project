we were ripped off the booking com site for this hotel says there is a garage for euros i left the car in the garage and when i went to pick it up two days later was charged euros per day i asked the hotel staff and they told me i needed to present a ticket from the hotel to get that price at the garage i explained to them that i had asked several times for directions about the parking but the hotel staff said nothing about a ticket they replied that since i had payed with a credit card there was nothing they could do so my parking for two days costed euros i find this situation totally unaceptable the room was small not clean at all and the bathroom had no ventilation and smelled i would have been better sleeping at the car
