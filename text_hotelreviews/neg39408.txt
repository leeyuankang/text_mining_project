travelling as a couple and had a booking confirmed for a double room we did expect this to mean one double bed however when we got to our room there were single beds pushed together this was a let down but we didn t mention to the staff so can t complain too much as they may have sorted this had we asked at dinner in the hotel bar restaurant the service was very slow and i did not receive one of the items i had ordered since the service was slow and no staff were around during the meal i didn t ask about it we did not feel that the quality of the food or service matched up with the price charged overall the meal was disappointing and over priced however there are a few places to east near by
