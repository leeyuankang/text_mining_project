the staff on reception were polite and friendly frank and his collegue also another young gentleman who checked us out on the tuesday were very helpful and allowed us to leave our bags with him whilst we explored the city we had the option for late check out at noon however felt that if customers had a later flight they could use a spare room to freshen up before flying at a small cost and not euros an hour for later check out possibly something to consider we had to use the reception toilets to change and wash ourselves i had to ask for someone to serve me at the bar when the bar and hotel reception wasn t busy it took roughly to be served as a member of staff was in the kitchen possibly doing something else or nothing at all some staff members did come across as rude and unhelpful but some were very helpful overall experience was good but i think standards could be improved with staff and the other things i have mentioned
