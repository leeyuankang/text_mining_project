the bed wobbled every time you moved the housekeeping does not replace the coffee coffee cups you have to pay to get extra after the first night no milk either the wifi is totally useless it automatically disconnects every few minutes and is painfully slow you can t get a good night sleep as the black out curtains don t block out the sun completely and the housekeeping staff are very loud come very disappointing stay
