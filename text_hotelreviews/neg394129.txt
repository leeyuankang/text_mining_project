no coffee tea making facilities in the room meaning we had to get ready and go to the restaurant and pay for them if we wanted it or pay for room service disappointing also we had asked for a quiet room when booking it was fairly quiet but the window still faced the very busy road and so we were awakened by ambulance sirens etc in the morning the guest who booked in ahead of us was told he had a room at the back which faced nothing and so was very quiet we had wanted the same but were told our room was quiet because it was high up not quite what i had wanted
