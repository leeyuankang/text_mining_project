in my opinion this hotel is an acceptable star establishment but not star girl on reception lacked warmth and not helpful like other guests not allowed to enter room until just before asked for room overlooking the street room overlooked decrepit buildings typical spanish but i elected to keep the room because it was at least quiet room was far too hot upon entry soundproofing poor delighted to see kettle but in a four star hotel you at least expect ceramic cups and or mugs styrofoam cups are not star there was a very selection of tea coffee no milk no spoon internet connection erratic even in reception handle to window was removable and did not connect well refrigerator door was loose and difficult to close bathroom poor quality fittings old taps shower curtain not glass screen no glasses in the bathroom just plastic beakers no plug for the sink and the bath plug was chained to the bath asked at reception for a sink plug and was made to feel uncomfortable in doing so eventually offered four different sized plugs and selected two one of which was rusty asked for a spoon and was told to get one from the bar staff if you go the pool area you will notice that some of the pictures used by the hotel have been photoshopped so as not to reveal the true extent of the view and state of the pool area chose not to have room cleaned on first morning saw the maid and just exchanged towels the next morning the maid could be heard at i left the room at and put the card requesting a clean on the door handle i returned at the room had not been cleaned i called reception housekeeper appeared minutes later and apologised said the maid had two floors to do that is not my problem it is a lack of sufficient staffing the utility room was one door away the maid would have passed my room all morning surely if a room had not been done the day before it must be a priority the following day
