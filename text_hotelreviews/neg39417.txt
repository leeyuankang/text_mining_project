service from breakfast staff and manager was quick efficient and friendly menu choice was good however the breakfast was cold well what you would call tepid the hash browns vegetarian sausage were well cooked slightly over cooked but had been left to go too cool or have just been kept warmed up beans were the same the mushroom and tomato were hot and lovely poached eggs a little cool manager did offer to get us a new breakfast but we had a meeting to get to and so he offered a free latte which we declined we should not have been charged for at least one of the breakfasts of us eating as we both couldn t eat the cold items in hindsight i feel i should have suggested we didn t pay for at least when i checked out but as we were short for time we didn t pursue it shame really as the rest of the stay was delightful
