the elevator had a jerky landing also they charged me for something after i checked out and after enquiring they said its for items i had taken from the mini fridge all was ok but what i didn t like was they charged to my card even without informing and only could know after i sent a message since i had not taken one of the item which i conveyed they were courteous to say that they will refund could be better if they charge to credit card they also inform the customer by email at least whenever they have records with them
