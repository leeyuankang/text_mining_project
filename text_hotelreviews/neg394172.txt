when we arrived they had put us in a twin room instead of a double room as requested room was clearly for a disabled person and wasn t up to standard at all requested to change room from the receptionist who was quite nice but advised we wouldn t be able to until the following day they changed us to a king room which was better but still not up to the standard for the price of the hotel receptionist in the morning looked like she didn t know how to smile wouldn t recommend
