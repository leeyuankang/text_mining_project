if you re going to stay there request a room not facing the street as it gets quite loud also the staff failed to notify us there was a party happening which went on all night long as being on the floor not ideal lastly upon check out we were told if we had sorted out our taxi issue to which we were told we had caused damage to a taxi then apparently told the taxi driver our room number and the staff had spoken to my mother in regards to this this is still ongoing
