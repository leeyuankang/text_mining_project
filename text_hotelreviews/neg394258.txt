i didn t particularly liked the food of the room service order at it was delivered pretty quick perhaps wasn t so fresh the pasta was badly overcooked and the ceaser salad there was way too much sauce compare how much salad there was shame really as the few lettuce i could test did taste quite fresh we also ordered an hamburger that was slightly better but still for the comparison quality price no good for me i do have to say that when i checked out i have gently complained to the reception and with much apologies and with no effort they haven t charge me for the ceaser salad and the pasta
