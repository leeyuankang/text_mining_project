staff could have been more friendly although only using the room for a quick change to attend a ceremony and just to sleep we still had to supply a credit card which was debited by on checkout we were presented with a bill for room service it took some time to be sorted and we were made to feel as we were lying my name was on the bill and someone else had signed it no idea how this was allowed to happen not happy we won t be staying here again
