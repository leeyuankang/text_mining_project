we booked a twin room and were told on arrival that there were none available after some time and an attempt at trying to get us to spend even more money on an upgraded room or an additional single bed the receptionist told us she had found a superior room with twin beds but it wouldn t be available until later in the day this was fine as we were spending the day in the city on arriving back to the hotel we were given our room keys and excitedly went to the room expecting a superior twin room instead we got a standard room with one king sized bed i immediately rang down to reception and explained the situation the receptionist sounded surprised that we wanted a twin room and offered to send someone up to split the beds no one arrived for a good half an hour by which time we went in the middle of getting ready for our evening event being held at the hotel we send the member of staff away and asked him to come after when we would have vacated the room minutes later a member of housekeeping arrived with bedding for the twin beds we also sent her away asked her to come back later all this inconvenience certainly impacted on our overall experience and left us wondering why we had chosen to stay at a hotel when clearly the service didn t match the rating i m not sure i would recommend the grosvenor house hotel to others after our experience
