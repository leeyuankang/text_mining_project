the food particularly breakfast was truly terrible i have actually had better in a premier inn eggs seemed to be powdered sausages did not taste good pastries were dry coffee tasted like instant not at all impressed it also took over an hour to serve me cocktails in the park room i eventually had to get up and ask to be served
