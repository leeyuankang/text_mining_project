the rooms on booking com are not of the regular rooms but rather the executive suites all the other rooms are not renovated and very dated they placed us on a smoking floor although we booked a twin room non smoking no one showed us where the coffee is the starbucks in the hotel does not taste like starbucks the wifi is not for free the receptionist did not give us a card for our luggage however later the concierge asked us for the card and gave us a hard time for not having it
