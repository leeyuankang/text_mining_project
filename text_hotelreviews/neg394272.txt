there was nothing we didn t like at hotel however we attended the royal variety performance and were at the banquet a security guard caused chaos and was very rude to us and another group of three insisting we were not allowed in unless we removed our jackets he said this was hotel policy we asked to see manager but never did and eventually he allowed us all to enter it put a damper on that function
