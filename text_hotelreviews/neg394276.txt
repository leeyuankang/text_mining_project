i requested red rose petals on the bed for my wife as we stayed in the hotel for our year wedding anniversary my request was ignored with no explanation pillows were too high and there was no option for flatter pillows in the room i did not get a good night sleep breakfast was very basic compared to other star hotels not enough vegetarian options wifi is not free the shower in the bathroom has heads the portable head did not work only the overhead rain shower worked i m disappointed in the value for money
