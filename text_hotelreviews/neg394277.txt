bedroom was very poor quality for nearly for the night admittedly i arrived early this attend an event at the hotel and rather than leave my bags until check in time i was offered early check in into a smaller room with complimentary breakfast an offer that i accepted however i hadn t expected the room to be so small and cramped even for single occupancy i struggled to find enough surface space for my belongings plus kettle etc the bed was small with a very soft sloping mattress that made me feel i was rolling out of bed it was a very uncomfortable night and very poor value for money
