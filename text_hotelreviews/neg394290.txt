where to start reception employees are way too rude and don t belong to stars chain hotels cleaneness of the room is a disaster when you call house keeping no one appears to care about your logical demands i had to call three times to get my room cleaned then i approached reception where i was promised to get the service needed immediately but guess what no one came to the room if you call concierge you d be lucky if someone attend to your call the bath top is so old the water does not get drained you d get soaked in dirty water and soap and when you ask for the issue to be repaired you d be lucky if they ever intend to do it the mattress is so old your back will suffer and you d need to seek for medical help by the time you re trip is over the waiterses at the steak house where breakfast is served are out of knowledge of the basic hospitality issues this hotel does not deserve the huge amount of money i ve paid for the service i received at this hotel i would assume a no star hotel would offer one thing for certain i will never stay at this hotel again
