when my colleague myself booked our rooms we booked a deluxe twin or double we are not sure we actually got that as when we checked in they told us they were changing our room allocation then we went to our rooms on floor mine was a disabled twin room which looked at a wall the services building my colleagues room was very small with a claustrophobic bathroom you could sit on the toilet clean your teeth other the sink at the same time
