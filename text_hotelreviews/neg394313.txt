in terms of wifi access this is the worst hotel i have stayed in separate log in for room ballroom restaurant but free wi fi at check in they want to charge you for use of internet in your room at a basic speed and an extra charge for faster with a separate log in for each device we were at a conference in the ballroom and i asked for an internet password so we could tweet real time they failed to fix it we couldn t tweet via wifi suggested it was the conference organisers fault i gave them feedback nicely and they refunded my room internet charge but since my complaint they have totally mis understood what i said they replied i m sorry you didn t get the internet speed you wanted complete mess up hopefully after this review someone might get it
