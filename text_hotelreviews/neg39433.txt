the car parking situation is awful they say there is parking and to get a permit ticket from reception who then tell you you can t get one and must pay at the booth where there is a man who s card reader won t work so you have to walk to the cash point to pay for parking it s honestly cheaper to park it on the pay and display outside and leave by the next morning
