cleaning needs slight improvement our year old son found one pair of socks behind the sofa that didn t belong to us and was dusty i e must have been there for a couple of weeks we would normally not check what s behind the sofa but i suppose house keeping should also the small tea table wasn t cleaned directly under it it obviously did not affect our stay but it s just that kind of small things that you notice toilet and bathroom were very clean as were the beds
