as a regular customer i asked to give me a room with a view to the park where i was staying last time the hotel answered that it could not be guaranteed but promised that in any case i would get a very nice room as a result i got a room next to the kitchen of the restaurant and all the new year s holidays i spent under a jingle of bottles and glassware there were no apologies from the staff by the way the tv did not work well and there were no slippers in the room
