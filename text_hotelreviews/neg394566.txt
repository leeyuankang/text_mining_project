if you are staying for more than days this place is not the right place the price is not worth the view vienna is an expensive city and the breakfast is really expensive here and not worth it in all the rooms they have two single beds joined together instead of a queen or king size the rooms have weird mural on the walls from the balcony you can see the balcony and room next to it we had to keep the curtain pulled when we were inside the room as we could see the people in the balcony next to us we felt that we made a mistake by taking this place when there are way cheaper and nicer hotels are available in innerstadt also because of summer their restaurant was closed which they didn t mention anywhere
