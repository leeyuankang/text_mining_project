only issue was that we had specifically booked a single room with a bath and a double room but on arrival were told the only rooms with baths were doubles and we were expected to pay the normal double price ie a supplement to get a room with a bath as the hotel had been renovated since we made the booking we had not been informed of this change despite emails welcoming us to our forthcoming trip etc only way round it was for us to take a double with bath and a single with shower and then to swap rooms at bathtimes not very satisfactory and we do not think this was fair treatment by the hotel management
