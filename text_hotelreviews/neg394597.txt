on the evening of thursday april we were notified that there was a problem and there would be no hot water between the hours of and we accepted that and didn t have a problem in actual fact there was no water at all no cold water for the toilet for a hotel this is really unacceptable we had already paid for a balcony upgrade for the goodwill and reputation of hotel am parkring i feel the least the management could have done was refunded this amount to us
