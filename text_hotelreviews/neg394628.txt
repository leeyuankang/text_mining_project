one day i left at to go out and my room wasn t cleaned until one night there was a banging and fan noise next door that woke me up at this continued for about an hour sounded like an extractor fan in a kitchen the breakfast was too expensive i ate out for less than half the price for a similar if not better one at a neighbouring star hotel for the room rate it should have been included
