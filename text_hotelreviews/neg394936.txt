all the staff is extremely friendly with the exception of the manager of the cascade bar who was quiet disappointing for an establishment like this there s a daily happy hour between and and the attitude the man had when asked if i could take my drinks to the room was just not right i stayed in the superior junior suite and the room is spacious with lovely views comfortable bed seating area and two big flat screens but the channels connection and scrolling through the tv menue wasn t smooth maybe the remote control was old and the channels weren t showing well the choice of channels is quite limited with many german speaking channels and not enough of the main english or french channels
