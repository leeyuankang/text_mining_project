we requested for connecting rooms as we traveled with three young children but was unable to get as the staff said to secure a connecting room we would have to book straight with them they don t really read the requests on booking com however they are quick to respond as we got the connecting rooms the next night but a hassle as we have to pack our things again to move to the connecting rooms
