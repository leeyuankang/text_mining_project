i found dirt underwear left over from the previous guest in the closet poor management in the breakfast for instant you will need to give them your room number your name and sign at the door that is not cool at all never happened to me before moreover that was no smile or good morning word i wouldn t care about that if i fill out the information while i am at the table the breakfast buffet was big and include many things however the food was not tasty the bed is not bad but i found it difficult to get rest kind of extra soft no free wifi in i know that before the booking but still surprised they still charge for that they prevent me to use the pool because they have some standards for the swimsuit i understand but still they should put sign or instructions before getting to the pool because it was embarrassing during the check out the receptionist was rude to me and to other guest next to me
