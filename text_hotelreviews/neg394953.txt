the rooms which were allocated were extremely dirty and unhygienic first off the room had a lot of hair from the previous guest from the floor to the walls the bathtub was extremely dusty the drawer in the bedside table had food crumbs and hair too we also found an insect on the bed sheet in the wardrobe we found a shopping bag which also belonged to the previous guests the breakfast had no good variety and the omelette was burnt and tasted sour we only went there for one day the service was also extremely bad when we asked for an upgrade or to check out early to go to another hotel they seemed like they were uncertain that the hotel was unhygienic they did however upgrade us to a better room the ac in all the rooms is set to auto on default there is a sensor to detect movement therefore when you re sleeping the ac s fan goes slow and doesn t cool effectively
