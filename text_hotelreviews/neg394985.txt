for such a well run hotel the gym was extremely disappointing whilst the workout room itself had newish equipment the pool and spa are years out of date not unclean but look grotty even a lick of paint would improve it greatly also the sauna was permanently locked and we never saw a single member of staff there it really doesn t match up to the rest of the hotel
