the heater didn t work as it is june and the hotel automatically turns it off but it was unseasonably cold and i was uncomfortable slept poorly the front desk staff the next morning told me i should have informed them and they would have brought me a heater the bed pillows were too fat for my taste i like flat pillows and pipes in the walls hot water perhaps were clunking and very noisy in the morning from about a m i was on the first floor
