one suggestion we have would be in regards to breakfast we thought we would try breakfast at the hotel on our first morning in barcelona sadly we were a little let down as the food did not impress small variety on the menu and after ordering our hot meal which arrived after min it was not a hot meal at all we were left with over cooked eggs and bland tasting food for euros per person it was not worth it at all we sadly didn t return to breakfast however this would not determine the fact of if we would return on not as we most definitely will can not thank the staff enough for their professionalism and willlingness to help
