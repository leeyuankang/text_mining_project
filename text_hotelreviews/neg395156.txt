that the roof top bar was booked out for events during saturday and sunday all afternoon till when we returned from a day out walking and exploring we had to sit in reception for a drink no access to the roof top pool bar this was why we booked so we could continue to sit and enjoy the view very disappointing and unhappy with not being told on arrival notification was placed up in the lift and reception after we had left each day to go site seeing we did get given a free drink for the inconvenience but paid a more expensive premium for the facility that we could use till monday should not be advertised as having the facilities if they block access to the guests
