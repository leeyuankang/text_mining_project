in room service was very very poor i had a hamburger thought one can t do much wrong meat was dry bread even more dry it came with chips instead of french fries don t know why taste was old the salad was fresh but the dressing came in a tiny plastic bottle and tasted very very much after plastic the additional souces like ketchup came in small packages without perforation to open only with teeth this has been one of the worst in room dinners i ve had in a very long time i have to say this was absolutely inacceptalbe for a hotel in this price range rating
