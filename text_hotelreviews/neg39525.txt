the only tiny thing that irked us was food in the restaurant we were given vouchers which gave us a really good deal we both chose steak off the set menu but were told that this wasn t available we ordered chicken instead which was ok a bit dry later another table came in and ordered steak which miraculously appeared the hotel should have honoured the set menu and provided the steak instead of saying this wasn t available breakfast was also very expensive which made us eat out
