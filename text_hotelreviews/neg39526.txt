i didn t notice the air conditioning was leaking until i had opened it for a while and there was some water on the floor however i called the reception and they sent someone to look at it immediately and covered some towels on it and since it was late at night so he promised that it would be fixed next day morning it was fixed the next day so it is not really a big issue the complimentary bottle of water was only placed on the day of check in and was not replaced after the room services
