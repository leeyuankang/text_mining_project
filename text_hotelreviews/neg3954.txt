unfortunately i got a room next to the kitchen extractor fan which was very noisy room by the way the first night it stopped at p m so that was all right but the second night it did not so i hardly slept at all however when i mentioned this at checking out i was compensated with having my breakfasts taken off the bill and promised a free upgrade next time i come so i ended up feeling more pleased than i had thought i would be i have stayed at the russell several times before after my sleepless night i thought this was the last time but because of the way my complaint was dealt with i will certainly return
