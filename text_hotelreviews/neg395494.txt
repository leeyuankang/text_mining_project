i didnt like the fact there is no telephone in the room so if you need something from reception you need to go there in person this wasnt very comfortable for me as i had to go there few times also the fact the door doesnt have incorporated peep hole doesnt make me feel comfortable at all you dont know who is knocking on your door when you re opening it the hotel is beautiful but the majority of the rooms are basically with no daily light at all i had to pay for upgrade to feel good in my room thanks god because of my birthday they got me better rate for that but i think they should inform the guests before they re coming to their accomodation about that fact
