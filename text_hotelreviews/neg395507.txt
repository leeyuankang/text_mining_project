attitude of the staff when there was a problem with the hot water in the morning their was no hot water they didn t excuse only answer we got was that we had hot water in the evening so for them all was ok seems strange for us also breakfast is overrated the same as everywhere no local specialties besides the traditional ham cheese and salami so below expectations as well
