if you wanted to be a prisoner it s a good choice for you it s not a hotel at all only a hostel for the better off the receptionist alessandio would command you don t do this don t do that when he introduced the area if you wanted to touch anything in the public area you had to ask for his permission first as our passports were locked inside the luggage which was stored by alessandio during check in time he blamed us not to submit the documents to him immediately and warned us that he had the right not to allow us to get in this rude attitude was not a normal hotel customer service if he gave us back the luggage of course we could give our documents at once the room was dark with one locked fake window which was facing the inside corridor whenever someone passed by they could see your room clearly so you had to lower down the curtain lived inside a dungeon or prison the bed had no duvet or blanket at all but only with one white sheet for you to cover when we asked for it they dared to say the horizontal bed decoration sheet was a blanket with further complaint the more nicer female receptionist finally gave us a duvet remember this place was not on the ground floor you had to pass three gates to go upstairs however the first gate was in a busy street and you had to press a button to wait the receptionist to open the gate the first day we had to wait more than minutes in the street before we could get in it was so embarrassing when everyone in the street staring at you as you pressed the button and waited so long if we paid the price of a hostel we would shut our mouth and say nothing it was ridiculous to pay such money to receive such service in this trip of spain we experienced the worst so called hotel in their word in our life
