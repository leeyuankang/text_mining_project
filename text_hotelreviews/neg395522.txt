there are no signs indicating where the hotel is it took minutes for us to figure out that the hotel is actually on the floor of a bulding but this is not indicated anywhere the staff of the hotel claims that this is because this place is supposed to be secret well i woild say rather than secret is badly indicated internet connection not working for an entire day when we complained about it the people at front desk tried to do some useless attempts to restore the connection and then they said that nothing could have been fixed until the day after as nobody works on sunday this happened on sunday result i could not send some important documents and this ruined my day we had a sleepless night some horrible noises of chairs and table being moved from above or maybe next door made impossible for us to sleep i believe that our room was right next door to a restaurant or something like that and nothing was done to make the rooms soundproof the idea of the ladies making the breakfast right in front of your eyes every morning is nice however the boiled eggs that we had cooked were hard like stones and these women were cutting slices of ham and cheese a time so we didn t feel like grabbing more than slice each because this would have meant to empty the plate of ham and cheeses available for the other guests summary the idea of this home style hotel is innovative however before spending time on details they should have spent time on more important things such as making the rooms quiet and soundproof or guaranteeing an internet connection to the guests if this is supposed to be margot s house margot has a lot of work to do to make my stay pleasant
