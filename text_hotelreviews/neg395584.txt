our two rooms looked very tired and in need of a renovation on our executive suit one small coffee table with a very dirty chair with rips in the arm rest you would expect two chairs with this table the second chair was a desk chair not suitable for the coffee table house keeping not consistent out of the days only one day was satisfactory also our executive room window view was into the back of buildings with renovations been carry out not good for an executive suit i guess we were unlucky by not getting a street view room overall very disappointing
