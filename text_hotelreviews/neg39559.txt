on arrival staff did not mention that the hotel would be hosting private functions on both the friday and saturday night from the music was extremely loud and caused everything in the room to vibrate for this reason i would only stay at this hotel from a sunday to a thursday night unless you are going to be in after or don t mind not being able to sleep or hear the television over the music
