at first i have received a room with a view to a major building site the room was lovely but the noise was unbearable i asked for another room i have received a dark room with a window facing the lift shaft one could hear all sort of noises from the corridor upstairs etc i was to tired to change the room again and the staff was not very helpful i must say
