we got the not renovated room and spent the most awful night in the hotel the sound proof was close to zero the staff was not helpful the bed was like in an old dormitory the linen was beyond simple and outdated since we were not moved the same night to the renovated room we asked for that the next morning we were offered a smaller but renovated room however we decided to move to a different hotel fearing the same bad experience if you stay at this hotel you need to make sure you get the renovated room
