the extractor fan in our room didn t work the window in our room didn t open and as the room was small the poor ventilation was an issue especially when the shower was on also there were no extra sockets so charging our phones etc was difficult we moved to a different room on the night of a night stay so at least the last night was better but and nights were disappointing
