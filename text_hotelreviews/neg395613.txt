during my stay somehow there was a cockroach in my room i believe this is the first time i ve ever experience having a cockroach in my room and i was staying in the floor which makes it more confusing when i was ready to sleep something walks by and because it was wooden floor i can hear it as well i turned on the lights and there it was a big live cockroach i screamed and called the receptionist and they killed it they moved me to another room which was supposed to be an upgrade but somehow feels like a downgrade because i like the previous room better and finally moved times to the same grade room overall it was my first time ever experiencing that and i wont forget it my whole life
