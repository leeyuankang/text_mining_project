reception staff on arrival i was effectively ordered to wait whilst the surly staff member did something terribly important on his computer for fully five minutes finally i was checked in by a second employee who had been chatting the whole time with another person however i m still waiting to be welcomed to the hotel during my five day stay only one staff member offered friendly greetings as i came and went it seems most of the others especially mr surly don t know the value of a customer sound proofing in rooms is excellent in blocking out street noise but between rooms adjacent and above footfalls cupboard doors and water noises were disturbing
