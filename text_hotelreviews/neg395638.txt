i was a little disappointed in the rooms we had the first room was a basic room with a balcony but the balcony was facing just roofs of nearby hotels no scenery we then asked to move rooms and the room we got the second time was just the same room but facing another hotel in close proximity i had seen the rooms on the website and was hoping for something a little more luxuries all in all a great stay though and would definitely go back i would just specify before hand which room i would like and with a better view
