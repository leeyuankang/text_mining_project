reception staff were very unfriendly we had to go in and out of the hotel with a stroller and many times the doormen didn t help us with the door the mini bar was actually a vending machine rather tacky got stuck because couldn t put my young daughter s food in the mini bar i asked the reception staff if the items could be removed and i got a flat no in response the other receptionist must have seen the look on my face and offered to keep the food in the fridge at the reception which is rather inconvenient when you have a young child and you have to go back and forth to the fridge the shower was awful it suddenly becomes hot and then goes back to the temperature you set it without warning the worst part is that it was happening while i was giving my toddler a shower it was a miracle she wasn t scalded i stayed there a week and to be honest only gave her a shower once i d much rather have her stink then burnt it kept happening even with rest of the family members but at least with adults they can quickly move out of the way
