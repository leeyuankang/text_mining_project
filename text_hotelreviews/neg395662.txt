first of all nobody cares for the notes or requests in the booking com apparently i have requested a double bed not twin we got very easily seperating twin beds i requested an upper floor if possible we got floor i requested a quiet room we got room facing pg de gracia that is filled with people in the night yes and floor so not a thing they just did everything opposing to the requests section let me be clear we didn t make the reservation a night before but months earlier so this is annoying very annoying especially that i also mentioned that we visit barcelona for the birthday of my wife that s why it is an indicator that they don t give a f other than that hotel properties itself the toilet door is glass and do not close like a normal door it s about half a centimeter short if you like your partner to hear ur farts it is perfect if not really uncomfortable the only access to the hallway to the rooms even floor is only possible by a small elevator no stairs so even you need to go floor downstairs u need to wait for the elevator to come and come empty which lasts like average minutes you could literally go up and down the stairs times in that time but hey no stairs blocked asking for credit card by check in for guarantee even u paid everything upfront months ago is disturbing i live in germany and believe me in germany not everyone has a credit card no seriously it is a very new thing around here people use german debit cards or cash here whatever it is annoying to sum up we don t recommend here to anyone and we will not stay there ever
