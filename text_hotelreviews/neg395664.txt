when we arrived we couldn t find our hotel very well even our taxi driver was confused by the address i gave him as we couldn t see it until someone came out to help with our bags the first night we stayed we tried to leave the room after dropping our bags off and our keys wouldn t work we were locked in our room the phone was not connected and when we plugged it in it didn t work we had to use our mobiles to call reception and explain we were locked in the room they were a little apologetic and offered us a new room floors up however the room itself was ok but the bathroom was not in great condition theshower leaked in to the bedroom taps were rusty and the hair dryer provided was not in very good condition considering it was in the bathroom the wire casing had split showing the wires inside the second night we asked where the bar was but what was failed to be mentioned when we arrived or even before we checked in was that the hotel was under construction the bar was shut reception had been moved and there was construction work being done on the room floors as well it wasn t a problem it would just have been nice for this to be mentioned when we checked in
