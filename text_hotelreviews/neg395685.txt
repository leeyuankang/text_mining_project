the fridge was closed and we asked them to open it to put our water they said you can only buy things from the fridge the room was a bit small as well as the tv which had no signal in some channels or the picture was not clear because it was aerial not digital there were no enough lights the bathroom was a bit of an old style generally the room does not reflect the lobby which was far more beautiful
