booked a suite but it was on ground floor with literally no view so was dark and unappealing to be fair they managed to find us a standard room higher up with balcony etc which was lovely breakfast was only until so we missed it both days bar is nice but not particularly lively being picky id say the wardrobe space was minimal and there was no bluetooth speaker in room
