room appeared to be directly under a janitor s closet or similar there s very little noise insulation so it s incredibly loud it almost sounds like they re in the room with you and banging on things minor little design issues like only having one hook to dry towels for two people other towel racks are attractive but rather narrow for hanging towels bed was quite soft uncomfortably so for me but all these are minor quibbles only the noise would stop me from coming back and i assume that other rooms are better
