omg noisy you could hear residents on the sides the elevator bell ringing echoing down the hall doors closing the worst though is the outside noise it s like a party happens every night right outside your window all hours of night people are walking up down the road yelling screaming singing so loud an interior room may elliviate it but still a noisy hotel for sure the price would be acceptable had it been located in a better area i get it was newly remodeled but you can t remodel the whole street i wouldn t go back fir these reasons
