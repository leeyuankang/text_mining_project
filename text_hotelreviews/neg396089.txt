information about the sun bed hire and the fact you had to pay euros a day to sit on them no information about this prior to booking or when there unfriendly staff coming round telling you the prices and also telling you off for eating your own food and drink in that area again no information about this you had to buy from their menus euros for a tiny bottle of water euros for a very small glass of beer scandalous as a result the pool area was always very quiet first time i have stayed as a guest in a hotel and had to pay to sit next to a small pool on top
