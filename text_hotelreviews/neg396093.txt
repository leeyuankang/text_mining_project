excessive charge for breakfast housekeeping was disorganised they were cleaning our room thinking we had checked out on day of our day stay on the tuesday night on our return to our room there was an overwhelming smell of chlorine and when we entered our room our eyes were immediately burning the reception staff did find us another room but this was at the front of the hotel and very noisy the staff did not seem overly concerned that we could have come to a great deal of harm had we been asleep in the room they didn t provide an appropriate response or reason for the chlorine fumes
