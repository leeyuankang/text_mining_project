during check in nobody offered to take our luggage to the room despite the fact that the luggage guy was there or welcome drink the rooms are not so modern if you are booking a standart room that you won t get a seaview instead you will have corner room with small window also they have central air vent system that cannot be controlled by yourself you cannot set the temperature in the room because the room thermostat is centrally locked we were in the beginning of may and it was kind of chilly at night but due to the fact that airconditioning were giving non adjustable hot air and the only window you can open on half is cm in width it was stuffy i asked the stuff three times first time they did totally nothing second time they send a repair guy which did not come at the third time they recommended me to open the window the pool is tiny maybe cm in depth and non heatable at all also i think that there is not enough place on roof terrace for sunbathing for such a big hotel during summer period the last day lunchbox was a total crap also i d better had a happy meal instead
