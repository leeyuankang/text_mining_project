the customer service was terrible there was no mention that all the sun beds etc would have to be hired you d think paying money in a hotel would allow you to use the sunbeds also couldn t lay next to the pool however were given no reason why not was told off for bringing outside water in the pool area on a hot day however no signs anywhere saying that this is not allowed my fianc got told off for wearing swimwear in the lobby when she was trying to find the bathrooms and the security embarrassed her and told her off in front of a group of customers checking in also the wifi was terrible on our floor and whenever i called to enquire about it i was told it must be my device because theirs was fine even though photos and an ipad had zero wifi connection for a hotel that is adults only they sure do treat you like children for the money you pay i wouldn t stay here again and i ve stayed in a lot of hotels
