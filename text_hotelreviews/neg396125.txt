i couldn t figure out how to get the water running out of the shower head so had baths instead found the tap tricky to figure out and hot water wasn t as strong as it could of been for me the location was a bit too far away from the city area where it was all happening it would of been nice to stay at this hotel in the hotter months it was still too cold for the beach in spring tho would be great in summer i would probably stay closer to the city action while it s cooler got a bit expensive getting cabs to and from but the train station is a min walk down the road so if you don t mind catching train then it wouldn t be so bad
