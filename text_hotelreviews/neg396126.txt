service was incredibly slow getting a drink at the bar or pool lounge could take forever no one ever seemed to be able to take payment without going downstairs to check something with the manager felt very hokey for a star hotel that cost as much as it did breakfast was also pretty terrible for a person we just ate breakfast in one of the cafes on the beach better scenery better service better price better food
