rooms at first they gave as a room at the end of the hall where you couldn t set the temperature this was very uncomfortable as it was quite chilly at night at the beginning of april as if that was not enough you could easily hear the traffic i reported the problem but only after days did they offer to change the room so we received room with sea view it was a little loud but it was warm on the next day we come in the room after a stroll on the beach to find the toilet in the middle of the bathroom there was no notice on the door no nothing they could at least inform us of the problem and apologize for the trouble but no the thing was that the cleaning lady reported the leaking toilet but it took a little while to repair it thanks but that is no way to treat your guests quite loud the hotel is situated on a one way street with lanes and the windows don t do a good job of isolating the noise payment policy after arriving they asked for my credit card to guarantee the reservation which i don t understand since they have my booking information then when i gave them my id i live in germany but i am eastern european they wanted the whole amount in advance this was very peculiar because i have seen other guests paying at departure which is how you normally do it pool very small
