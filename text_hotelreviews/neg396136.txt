unfortunately the hotel let itself down a lot myself and friends have booked through booking com before and it has always been to a high standard this time however it was not firstly for our entire time there we didn t have a shower when we first checked in i realised the shower was not working and went downstairs to complain the man at the desk said he was busy rude and there was no one else in the hotel this was a sunday so he would have a look when he got the time too as we were going out he said he would leave us a note in the room once he had a look hours later when we came back to the hotel the shower and still not been fixed so i went downstairs and asked a different male employee if he had any update on the shower he said i m sorry but the last guy didn t leave any note about your shower but he promised to send maintenance in the morning the next morning surprise surprise no one came the man said he had a look and the shower wasn t working thanks for confirming what we already knew but he would send maintenance who never arrived we then asked a female employee the next day who said she would send maintenance but again no one came overall very poor customer service i even asked them to tell the manager i wanted to speak to her him whenever they got a chance but nothing shame house cleaning didn t replace our soap weird air con had issues would become extremely cold and then hot without being touched staff were useless the lady receptionist was the only one who even seemed to care would not stay here again i told the staff i was not happy to pay approx per night and not even have the opportunity to shower i feel let down by the hotel and booking com for suggesting it as they are usually excellent
