the fact that our shower tap broke and continually spewed water out which could not be stopped when reported we were told that someone would come early in the morning to fix it obviously we would not accept this and we were moved at our suggestion to another room it was dealt with ok in the end but to suggest to a guest that they could listen to pouring water overnight and then be woken if they got any sleep by a maintenance person early when they were on holiday was to say the least a little stupid and thoughless the new room was great better than the original one
