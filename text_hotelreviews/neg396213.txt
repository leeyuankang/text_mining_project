staff were poorly trained particularly at the roof bar where i often waited minutes for a drink i found the staff to be quite dismissive and unhelpful on one occasion a manager was present who had excellent manner and i noted that staff performed better in his presence rooms were not cleaned well the shower and hairdryer in the room broke intermittently check in was delayed and this was relayed to us in a very rude manner on the whole there was a hostel like vibe at this hotel there was little attention to detail except when managers were present
