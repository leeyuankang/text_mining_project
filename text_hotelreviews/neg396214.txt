the corridors i felt were a little dated and needed a bit of a refurb and the tiles near the lifts were all loose the jacuzzi was lovely but the room could do with a revamp its very musty and a bit dirty the breakfast is very overpriced and it wasn t very nice although very friendly the staff could be pretty slow i think its a very overpriced hotel for drinks food and the sunbeds being euro for people already paying to stay there is a total rip off and euro for a small water in the mini bar
