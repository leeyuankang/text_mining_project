booked a superior double room which in my personal opinion is the same equivalent to standard travel lodge double room no toilet roll for days no price list for mini bar when we asked at reception we were told they would be put in our room which they never done for anyone who likes to have a swim in the pool to start of your day will be very disappointed as it is not possible to swim in the pool a kids pool comes to mind you need to hire the sunbeds loungers starting from per day we were recommended a restaurant by the manageress so we asked the hotel to book a table after been told the restaurant was fully booked for nyts we got a booking for our last night arriving at the restaurant it was shut and doesnt open on the night the hotel had supposedly booked for us wake up call we requested was mins late classed as a four star hotel the over all service and customer care is very poor we left the hotel disappointed and definitely will not be returning
