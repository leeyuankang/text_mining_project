we were unluckily surprised when we had to wait one extra hour for our room to be prepared when checking in finally we had to complain about the room for not being what we have reserved via booking com we ordered double room with double bed cm nad single bed or so we got only two single beds and one extra bed which was not a proper bed bud folded out arm chair the new room in stead was a bit better but we got it after next hours so lost hours when checking in and the room was even smoky the last complain is about the room services when during nights the room was cleaned only twice because the cleaning staff came always late when we were already in the room after or so first of all the hotel shouldn t offer a room for the rooms are rooms for two but for three it is like in small student dormitory and the price completely does not meet the dis comfort i would never again book this hotel and the only thing we did not complain and did not require reimbursement was that we did not want to waist our holiday time but the booking com should check on the details and probably complain to the hotel instead of us we may be reimbursed some money but not the time we had to spend in the untidy and not corresponding room
