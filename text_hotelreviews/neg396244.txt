the first room we got was smelling like tobacco we had to ask to be moved to another room we have booked a superior double room in a star hotel and we were only offered a small shower gel for two people there was no water boiler for making tea and the room facilities as such were quite basic the staff told me that a water boiler is only available in the deluxe type of rooms which i frankly find ridiculous that is the type of service you get even from a hostel i have also asked to be provided with more shower gel in consecutive days but the room service people have always forgot overall the staff felt somehow bothered by tourists i understand barcelona gets busy in the summer but let s not forget we are paying for a service in a star hotel and the expectations should be that they can deliver a better service than a hostel all in all while i have been to other barcelo hotels and resorts and the service and facilities have been excellent the impression i got from this particular barcelo hotel was not up to the quality of the barcelo chain
