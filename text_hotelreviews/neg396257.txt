huge disappointment they do not treat guest seriously we d booked hotel more than month before our stay we d had two requests one single bed which is available when you re choosing room and second high floor i recieved e mail from hotel that both are accepted guess what we ve had two single beds and a room on a first floor the room was extremely noisy because of cars and pedestrians walls are like they were made from paper broken shower broken toilet one is sure it was not like four star standard
