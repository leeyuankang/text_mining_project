direct transport link from the hotel to the city centre either by bus minutes from the hotel or metro minutes walking from the hotel however it does take min by bus to get to placa catalunya so the location may not be your first choice if it was your first time in barcelona presumably you d like to spend a bit more time wandering in the city centre
