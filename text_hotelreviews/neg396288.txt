the room was not ready on time and they asked us to come back at we did and they said it was still not ready so we sat around for another half hour the wi fi in the lobby didn t work the premium room is very small and nothing like the picture no palm tree view for us just a view of the wall of the next building it needed to be painted the toilet in the bathroom wobbled the bath which was very small took forever to fill and the drain made a horrible gurgling sound when emptied on our last day water leaked from the ceiling in the bathroom we told the front desk and they asked our room number we told them and they said oh interesting that it s happening on that floor too all this wouldn t be so bad except the price for the room was quite high this is four stars
