the only problem about the hotel is definitly its location which is not close the night life places after midnight the only option to return back to hotel is to catch a cab the taxi drivers are not in a hurry because taximeters are running either you go or stop so when you stop in red lights which are quite frequent in the city you can pay different price in every occasion
