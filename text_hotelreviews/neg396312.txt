the breakfast room is quite small resulting in some queuing and the choice felt quite limited after a few days of the same thing on one or two occasions i felt that couples who spoke spanish were given tables ahead of me despite being behind me in the queue when i checked out for my trip to sitges i was advised that i owed money for borrowing beach towels and parasols during my stay the in room literature asks guests not to take room towels to the beach but to get a beach towel from reception but makes no mention of a charge in fairness though when i expressed surprise as i hasn t been told about this the hotel waived the cost straight away as with most hotels in europe it seems the only english tv channels available were news channels whereas other countries had more variety obviously i wasn t there for the tv but it would have been nice to unwind after a hard day s sunbathing with something other than world news
