the saturday evening bar staff were fairly busy and less attentive than usual the air conditioning was very noisy we opened a window to cool the room but then of course there was noise from outside the bathroom was small fortunately we are small people but even so the space is small for even one person i really do not like the glass doors on your bathrooms less privacy and the light from the bathroom is intrusive if someone is asleep
