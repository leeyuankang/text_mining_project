we got to our room and it had not be cleaned properly hairs in the shower and the floor was dirty the size of the room was small and for the amount it cost i would have expected a little bit more our card didn t work for the sauna and fitness suites we had a noisy hotel guests next to us and when reported was told why did you not just call down next time you should call down to security was really disappointed with this hotel it advertises itself well but in reality it s not great
