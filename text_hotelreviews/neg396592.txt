i reserved a room for non smokers but there was a strong smell of smoke in the room even though i addressed this with the staff no action was taken i m not very sensitive but it is extremely unpleasant to smell of smoke as a non smoking person i had to keep myc clothes in a plastic garbage bag protect them from the smell of smoke still my colleague was wondering if i had taken up smoking also cleaning of the room left a lot to ask for there was still plenty of sand on the floor after cleaning
