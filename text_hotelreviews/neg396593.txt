the room is not four star it has a four star bathroom but the living area is cramped with two single beds that leaves a small foot wide lane in front of the bed and a small x area by the window other than a ryokan room in tokyo this is the smallest hotel room i have ever rented it seems like the designers of the building sought to maximize the number of bodies that could be crammed into the available real estate there is only one chair to sit in and a small desk the television is a small inch that is hung on the wall to save space it did not have a closet but rather two bars to hang your clothes on that are in a recessed space approximately inches deep behind the room door there is little in the way of shelving with its low ceilings and small square footage the room feels cramped and even claustrophobic
