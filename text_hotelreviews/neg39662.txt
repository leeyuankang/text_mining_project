the hotel is being renovated so of course there was building noise and the place looked terrible from outside inside my room was modern clean and nice though there are some teething problems with the tap on lights no mirror on desk where the hair dryer was attached to had to ask for amenities why didn t cleaners just leave amenities when they could see they had been used dirty cleaning clothes left behind from cleaner wifi was a bit dodgey and then when cable was given couldn t get it to work from any of the sockets
