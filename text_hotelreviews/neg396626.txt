there was a party in the hall beneath our room the music was unbearable they went on untill went to complain of the noise at the reception the receptionist told me the party was booked months in advance long before i made my booking so it was my fault that i chose to stay on the first floor there was nothing he could do the problem is that i was given the room i didnt choose it and if had i wouldnt have chosen that room in view of the impending party
