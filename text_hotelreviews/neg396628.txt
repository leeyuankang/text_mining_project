we spent days in the hotel for our honey moon we specified this is the reason but there were no decorations in the room like they were advertising they have for honey moon periods the room was very small there was little room for persons we asked to change it with a room with sea view assuming this would have been bigger but it was also small and the sea view was limited by trees and buildings not at all looking like in the commercial of the hotel there was no fridge mini bar in the room this is not acceptable for a room of euros per night there was no drawer in the room to place your clothes there was no heat in the hotel i asked at the reception to turn the heat on and they said this is not possible they will bring an extra blanket decaffeinated coffee was not available for days during our full stay overall for the money we paid euros for nights the hotel did not raise up to the expectations felt more like a stars hotel i regret staying there especially for our honey moon mainly because of the poor quality of the room
