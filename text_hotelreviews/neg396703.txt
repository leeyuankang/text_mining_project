i stayed in a suit and there is not a separate lighting switch for the bed room that was a bit annoying at night the music coming from the very nearby arena was sometimes annoying at night and i wished the hotel windows have a better isolation like the ones i have in my apartment which is in a tower in a very busy area in dubai
