reception staff were rude and need better training the hotel charged me for the room then also preauthorised my card for the room again and extra charges my colleague and i did not want to charge anything to the room anyway and made them aware of that before they have done it i was left with no money for my trip i used the phone at reception to contact my bank and i was concerned about my account being negative to which they said it was the hotel receptionist had the cheek to ask me how much longer i ll take on the phone then claimed that the bank is lying and they don t owe me any money she was useless and basically said the nights team will deal with it and just let me walk away without anything being unsolved the hotel blocked my card with this amount for over weeks once i have posted a bad review that s when they suddenly knew how to speed up this process and finally returned my money
