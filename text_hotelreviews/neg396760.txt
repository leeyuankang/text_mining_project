my room was a little scruffy and looked like it needed updating some broken furniture and not quite in keeping with how beautifully decorated the bar area was but the room was absolutely spotless and i can t fault how well stocked the bathroom was considering we didn t spend too much time there it was great fir what we needed we had a few bits from the pool bar menu and weren t impressed but you can t please everyone
