the beds were very bad not n relation with a hotel the service is very poor we wanted to reduce the amount of days from to days because some other plans came up which they never accepted as it was none changeable dates fair as i mentioned to them you probably think the hotel doesn t want to loose money ok but in the end the hotel will loose money in the future because i will never come back and i will certainly not recommend it to my network so that is the price for not being flexible and trying to make us happy moreover the staff never says hi to you never asked us how was our stay or if we needed a taxi they are just ignoring you every possible way and we noticed this applied to all guests i think that the hotel needs more leadership another bad example was the lack of towels at the pool we were informed that the practice of having towels available at the pool was cancelled the week before is this really a star hotel
