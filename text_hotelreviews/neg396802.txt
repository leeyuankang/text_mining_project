room facilities barely adequate no tea or coffee no bath robe or slippers to use for swimming etc choice of english tv stations very limited and no shelf space for clothing the menu displayed outside was not available in the hotel and the only food available at night was in the pool caf which was extremely basic the cooked breakfast was also limited with only ever scrambled egg rather than fried poached etc
