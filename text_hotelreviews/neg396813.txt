even though there was signed saying that reservations of sunbeds were now allowed and towels would be removed no one did this and the sunny beach type guests staying at this hotel completely occupied the pool area and went to lunch leaving their towels on the sunbeds for hours no one did anything about it do something about this to give service to your guests cleaning was something that one had to wait on for hours at pm if we left at in the morning the cleaning still hadn t been done and we had to call to get our room cleaned
