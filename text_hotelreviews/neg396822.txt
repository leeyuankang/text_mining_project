i did not like that free wifi access was only available in the lobby i have traveled across the usa and europe and free wifi connection throughout a hotel lobby and bedroom is no longer a luxury it s standard this is especially true for star hotels this is the first hotel that did not offer free wifi in the bedroom i also did not like that i was deceived from the hotel webpage that read free wifi it did not specify that free connection was only in the lobby i also noticed that the air conditioning was not the same in all rooms my bedroom in particular had a very weak fan others were much cooler
