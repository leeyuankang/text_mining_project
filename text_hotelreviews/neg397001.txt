not directly related to the hotel but more related to the general city condition i am quite sensitive to noise and we stayed in a room right on a noisy side street however this is just a proof of how lively barcelona is i was prepared with my earplugs so it is a recommendation to anyone who is a light sleeper bring your earplugs in case
