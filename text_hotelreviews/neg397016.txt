we had trouble with the hot water in two occasions on one day the water was boiling hot and no matter what we tried we couldn t use the shower we didn t tell the management about that the next day there was no hot water so we called the management it is worth mentioning that they acted quickly and in the end the problem was solved they kindly offered a discount for the inconvenience plus free breakfast for the remaining of our stay i certainly hope this will not discourage anyone from staying at the duquesa de cardona i for one will certainly stay there again
