i did not like being removed from my table at the terrace bar for an upcoming reservation when i had been there for an hour continuously eating and drinking with friends i have never heard of having to reserve a cocktail table at a hotel bar the terrace was the main selling point for me in choosing the hotel so i will not be returning even though everything else was great
