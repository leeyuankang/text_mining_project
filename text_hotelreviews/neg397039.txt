construction zone construction was going on while we were there with drilling banging and clanging for hours now i m a heavy sleeper and after a long flight and jet lag i was ready to go into a coma after checking in luckily it didn t happen at night but with so much noise all chances of us taking a nap were gone this is the worse noise i have every experienced ever at a hotel to make it worse i asked the front desk staff to tell me when the work would be done he said perfect i though it s only more minutes i can finally sleep nonetheless the banging clanging and drilling continued on and on for at least another few hours until i went down stairs and told the front desk person we couldn t sleep so i went out sat by the water went to the atm etc went back to the room still clanging and banging they didn t have any other rooms so they finally called the construction crew and told them to stop the noise by biggest disappointment comes from the lack of transparency on behalf of the front desk staff after i talked to them about it twice in addition they didn t offer a discount or apologize upon checkout i finally asked for a discount and got it it looks like it s going to be a large project and addition to the whole right side of the property it doesn t look like something that will be done quickly in addition if you called and you asked if the work was over i can t be sure you ll get a straight answer
