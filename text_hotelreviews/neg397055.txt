i will start from the end if not for one event that cast a shadow on my staying which was for nights i would have given it the highest esteem the event a guest played loud music at the middle of the night for three hours which was too intense to sleep the stuff tried but could not stop him what amazed me is not this particular occasion but the ignorance of the hotel management from it during the rest of my stay at the hotel another nights this behavior of the hotel management brought me to degrade my evaluation of the hotel and to a decision not to stay again in this hotel this wasn t my first staying in the hotel but was the last from a quality hotel i expected to get an official apology from the management and a compensation if only symbolically and small to clarify their understanding of the uneasiness of a guest who stayed there for nights
