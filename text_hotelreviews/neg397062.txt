the room was awful claustrophobic airless lightless it was their basic room but at per night i expected better it was horrible having to spend time in the room but due to poor weather we occasionally ate there i asked for a table to eat at but was told we couldn t have one so we had to borrow an occasional table from one of the lounges avoid the basic room like the plague i would have upgraded it had been offered but then that would have been really pricey
