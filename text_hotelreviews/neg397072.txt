overall the bed was very uncomfortable especially the pillows so i didn t have a great nights sleep i had a back room without a view so a view is your thing then pay the extra because you certainly don t get one if you don t i stayed at other hotels star which were slightly cheaper and in my opinion much more superior in terms of location professionalism and friendliness of staff and overall comfort
