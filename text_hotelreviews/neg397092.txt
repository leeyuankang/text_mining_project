expensive for what you get way over priced for what i think this property deserves the pool is very small and can barely fit people more of a big bath rub than a pool breakfast isnt bad but expensive for what is offered location is not bad but i would suggest something closer to the downtown rather than closer to the beach on the edge of the city
