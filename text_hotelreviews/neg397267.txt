the only small niggle is when we tried to pop in to restaurant informal for an early bite to eat but were turned away by a snooty maitre d who was just not interested in seating us in an otherwise almost empty restaurant we were slightly dressed down but as guests at the hotel we weren t expecting to be insistently directed to the rooftop bar or the level snack area a disappointing blemish to an otherwise brilliant experience
