the rooms were to small and everything crammed in the overall condition of hotel is poor with major decoration work needed bathroom was in poor condition with bath panels falling off the extractor fan did not work there was excessive noise from outside i e the kitchen vents etc so we could not have windows open at night if we had wanted to open them it was only about which is ridiculous the air conditioning was so loud we could not get a full nights sleep it also seemed to be stuck at one temp even if you adjusted it the tv remote did not work properly so had to use controls on the tv unit itself which meant getting out of bed to turn tv off which at the hotel prices should never be the case we wanted luxury not excercise
