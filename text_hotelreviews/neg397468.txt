this is not a star hotel star max the common parts and the rooms reminded me of a hostel the room had shower cubicle and a loo within it with glass doors and no locks anyone else in the room or across the road admittedly with binoculars as it is a big road had a good view of ones ablutions did not like that at all common parts and main entrance need a massive upgrade to at least try and resemble a star hotel
