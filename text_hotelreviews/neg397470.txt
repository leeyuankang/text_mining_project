only distraction where the shower stall which had two very large stones as a floor they where a little loose and when you moved around in there they could shift and grind against each other making a very annoying loud screeching noise like an industrial accident just happend the shower stall was clean however i did feel it could use some general maintence as it did have a somewhat worn look and feel to it
