we have serious criticism about the hotel s cleaning services for two days they did not clean the room until we complained to the principal it should be noted that after the complaint there was indeed an improvement and the room was cleaned on a daily basis we also received financial compensation the bathroom in the middle of the room looks good but totally useless and takes up space in a room that is already small
