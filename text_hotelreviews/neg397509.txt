the design of the room is very cool but impractical there is a huge sharp edged pillar nearly in front of the entrance door and the toilet so if you re not attentive you can easily hurt yourself the two seperate sinks are a nice idea but the size is horrible there is no way you can use it without spilling water everywhere it s too tiny
