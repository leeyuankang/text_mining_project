we were given a room on the third floor first but the bed was rock hard twin bed if you like a good night sleep then ask to check the bed first or move you to another room the staff was very helpful and let us change to one on the fourth floor double bed which was much better the only issue is that the room had a musty smell behind the bed frame slightly annoying
