the bath was in the middle of the room which was very awkward its ok if you re traveling in couples it s got another shower room and a toilet by the side the hotel provided basic toilettes but no toothpaste and toothbrush which was normal in most europe hotel the balcony faces the main street which would have some noise from the people in the street the air conditioner was not working well but it was ok as its just around degrees in april the cleansing lady didn t refill the towels and minibar we ll have to ask for ourselves
