as frequent traveller i expected much more than this from a hotel with a good rating on booking the staff were so slow and will take forever to pick up the phone i called times to get a bottle of water to the room and it took minutes to get it the toilets were not comfortable my friend wanted to visit and had to press the entrance button at the door for minutes up until they got them into the hotel
