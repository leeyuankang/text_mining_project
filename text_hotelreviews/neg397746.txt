when paying almost pounds for a room per night the fact breakfast is an extra euros and wifi is euros per day is obserd also having no tea facilities in the room is ridiculous therefore having to pay an extra euros per cup of tea when paying this price for a room i wouldn t expect these added costs and made our holiday very depressing
