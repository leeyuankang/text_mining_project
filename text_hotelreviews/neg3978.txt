the room was a bit small and warm as only window of the could be opened for only inches our room was on the side of the hotel and the morning sun makes the room so hot bathroom was a bit disappointing small very tine sink next to bath like u have in your house in a downstairs toilet your elbow touches the wall when brushing teeth or cleaning face shower head is the old fashioned the one attached to the wall so you cant take the head down
