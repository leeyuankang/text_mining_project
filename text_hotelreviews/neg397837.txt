doormen were friendly and courteous the man who initially checked us in at reception was not however as we didn t deal with him again it didn t bother us other than those initial few minutes but not a good first impression hotel didn t bother to respond either way to a request for an earlier check in it was clearly unavailable when we arrived which is fine but this would have been good to know in advance with a young child
