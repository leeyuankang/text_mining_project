personal at front desk was rude and slow at check in check out process the house itself was a key factor when choosing our hotel unfortunately when we arrive the outside part was under renovations and thus all covered since this type of maintenance is scheduled in advance i think the hotel should have warned clients with reservations on that period also noise from the construction was very annoying at times
