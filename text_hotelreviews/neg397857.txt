the casa fuster has stars may be long long time ago it was justified but from our experienced hotel know how all around the world it s far away from stars the rooms are very noisy you can hear the guests above your room as they would be in yours you can hear the neighbours snoring the housekeeping ladies did a good cleaning job but they re working and talking so noisy that you ll awake between they did not fill up the minibar for days to enter the shower for senoir guest is terrible to high and to small door around cm i ll attach a picture the swimming pool is roughly x meters the prices in the bar is far to expensive in compare to other stars hotels for cappuccino and small beer even more the waiters there are cold and distanced not to say bored this is not what the guests feeling comfortable sorry but we really can t recommend this hotel
