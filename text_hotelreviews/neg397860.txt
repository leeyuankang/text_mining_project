we came back from a rainy day trip in the hotel a female staff member curly hair told us on friday evening around pm that the restaurant kitchen was only open until pm and that we could not have a reservation at that moment or some later later she told the restaurant was fully booked i really doubt about this as the opening times were mentioned differently she proposed to take a reservation for diner in a nearby restaurant la farga in the diagonal street she remarked that it was known as the best fish restaurant in barcelona it seemed to be a bakery and restaurant combination our diner experience was not at all aligned with what the hotel staff told us we were very disappointed about her advice according to me it was not a professional approach for a hotel
