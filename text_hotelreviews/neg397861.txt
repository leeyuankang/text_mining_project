the lighting system in the room was designed by a psychopath there are about light switches which pretty randomly operate different lights we had to ask the hotel staff to help us turn some lights off they sent a technician it took the guy about minutes to figure it out breakfast is nice but extremely over priced can be noisy even with all windows shut location is not too close to the main attractions but still not bad
