think the room was a little small and we had difficulty with the bathroom door i e it was impossible to close or even to move the thing at all i also think that in spite of its strengths it is overpriced i don t think that the standard room that we stayed in warrants what they are charging per night not great value for money in comparison to similar priced hotels elsewhere
