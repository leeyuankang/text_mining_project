our whole suite had one lighting system so whenever i used the bathroom shower toilet during the night or in the early morning hours the whole room had to be illuminated there isn t a separate bathroom light husband was not a happy camper in room snacks and drinks weren t refilled after we ate drank them would ve liked to enjoy them again blackout roller shades needed some attention they were quite squeaky when rolling up or down which takes some time
