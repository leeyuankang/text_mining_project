the hotel charged me around euro for six nights when i got reservation for using extra services in firs floor they claim that in booking com in with this services you have special facilities like soft drink and snacks and chips but that was awlful and it was not fair on the other hand the staff did not have uniform and you could not guess this is hotel or apartment
