but i had two under five year olds with me and the window was not safe at all it s relatively easy to open and there s no safety after that if you re in the bathroom and your child opens the window god forbid that s super dangerous also if you re using a stroller there are stairs even in the corridor of our floor itself so it s a hassle lifting up and down
