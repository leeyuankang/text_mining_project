we had stayed at the majestic several years ago and everything was perfect this time the first room they gave us was simply not a star hotel standard paint was missing on the closet the table was full of dents the staff was helpful and moved us to another room which was better but there was an old soft drink on the balcony and a used breakfast card left on our bed
