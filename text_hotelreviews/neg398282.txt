the terrace on the top floor was chaos access was only possible if you queued and as a hotel guest you were not giving any priority but stood behind people who were not even staying in the hotel the car took minutes to get delivered back to me even though i requested it minutes before coming down to check out the spa on the top floor has to be reserved and once again in a hotel so large it is not easy to find the time you want in general this is a star hotel there are far better choices for real star luxury in barcelona at the same price
