food and drink seemed a little expensive but probably in line with a five star city hotel it seemed a bit tricky to use the pool as it seems like a restaurant with a pool in it we went up to the roof for a drink which was lovely and the views are stunning but would have felt awkward swimming there certainly wouldn t want to have turned up in swimwear with a towel
