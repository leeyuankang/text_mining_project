overall the hotel was fine but i wasn t wow ed the w on the other hand is amazing and although the w is somewhat further away from the action as in not on the passeia graccia i preferred that the hotel was super crowded too crowded it did not feel like a peaceful escape from the craziness of the streets of barcelona the room was too small and we had a view of the interior courtyard but from the first floor we were basically staring at the restaurant the w was the same price per night and i thought we got far more for our money
