to me it is generally not acceptable for such category hotel with relative expensive room rate even not inclusive of breakfast and the breakfast charge alone is also very expensive but i still tried but ended up with disappointments staff were nice but not quite responsive i called for service but no one was picking up the phone at all i went downstairs and spoke to the reception desk but they just blamed it to the telephone line i like to stay in luxury hotel when i am traveling pleasure to have different experience so that i can share with my friends i chose two hotels just nearby nights at hotel palace gl which was fantastic and nights at majestic but to be honest the latter was very much below my expectations
