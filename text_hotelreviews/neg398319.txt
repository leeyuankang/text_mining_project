i was a returning guest for nights this trip and the only thing that i had unfortunate experience with was that there was a problem with the water heating system where the water temeperature would change drastically from hot to cold vice versace while i was under the shower i explained that to the reception after my first night and came back that same day being informed that it has been taken care of but the same thing happened the following day so for nights showering was very inconvenient for me in that room my room was changed i was upgraded with thanx to the majestic staff but still i had to repack unpack again for the remaining nights which was very time consuming very inconvenient for me
