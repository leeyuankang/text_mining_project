although the hotel has spa in its name the spa itself was very weak we ordered aroma theropy but in fact it was not so out of marks the so called landmark view of the room selected was not really so perfect to see nice views of barcelona it was a room with view on the street do not know what is offered with standart view breakfast was quite good in term of options but very expensive in term of price per person some staff members does not know english very well we ordered jasmine tea but received mint tea in the bar we expected to have nice romantic dinner at the hotel with live music but was surprised to hear that there is no such option in the hotel
