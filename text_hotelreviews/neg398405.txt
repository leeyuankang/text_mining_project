minor quibbles none of which take away from this being one of the finest lodging of my life calling the front desk was a nuisance it would ring times before someone answered the in room guide said towels would be changed on request and no daily housekeeping was included when we met our housekeeper in the hall he told us he d tried to get in every day but we had the no service sign up had we known a freshening up was included we d have handled it differently unlike some other flats they throw out all the leftover guest items tea coffee salt pepper napkins etc so when you move in there s nothing in the cabinets from prior guests
