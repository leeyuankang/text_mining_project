for a night i expect more our room was smaller than the cruise ship stateroom we had just left and looked out on an airshaft the promised pool is a small plunge pool on the roof with a beautiful view but water was not heated on a very cool october evening so we did not swim we requested twin beds but discovered a king too late the first night to change it they did fix this for the second night the wi fi was down the whole days of our stay
