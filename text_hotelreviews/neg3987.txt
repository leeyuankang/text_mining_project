the rooms are not so good the first night i stayed on the floor the room was unconfortably cold as the roof is not insulated and the windows are very old and draughty only lukewarm water in the shower in the morning the second night i moved to the third floor the room was larger and nicer but again the windows were draughty and single glazed and the sink in the bathroom was ridiculously small
