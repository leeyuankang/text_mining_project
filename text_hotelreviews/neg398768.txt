the staff was friendly but there was no room service at pm and all i asked for was hot water because the kettle was broken also the night before i left the hotel i asked the reception to organize a taxi at a specific time in the morning to take me to the airport but when i was ready to leave the taxi wasn t there the staff was changed due to shift and they were not aware of the situation which was very disappointing
