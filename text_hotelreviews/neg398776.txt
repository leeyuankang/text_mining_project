relatively small space in the room you cannot open the window in the room and the air condition was not working really well which is a bit problem then with humidity and smell plus there is no hanger in the bathroom for towels which was a bit strange my other recommendation would go to staff if we are considering this is a star hotel i would maybe expect more advice or help for tourists as most of the attractions in barcelona are limited for capacity and already booked i would give in advance that information to clients that they should book online for attractions or ideally the hotel could do that for themselves
