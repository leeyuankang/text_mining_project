where to start it was disgusting that we were supplied with one bottle of water over our night stay in a premier room it was very bad that the only bar available was the roof terrace that opened at the breakfast was appalling all hot food was cold and the eggs were also dry almost like dry powder we had paid a total of for rubbish as seasoned travellers we are away from home months a year and always stay in accommodation we found the hotel very poor in quality and certainly not value for money
