no face clothes in the room to wash your face i guess europeans don t use face clothes the room is ok but the shower and bath is not well designed whenever i take a shower the water splash outside because the floor is the same level as the bathroom floor maid is not very friendly or helpful at all breakfast is ok did not provide fresh omelet overall it is a nice hotel but pricey
