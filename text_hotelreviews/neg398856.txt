a disappointing experience some of the staff at the reception and the terrace were unfriendly and rude sleeping at the room made me feel like i m sleeping in the corridor i could hear everything slamming doors people chatting or even when the housekeeping are cleaning the rooms the reception area is so small and crowded most of the time
