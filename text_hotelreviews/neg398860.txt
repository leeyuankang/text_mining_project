don t get me wrong with my comments i have stayed at this hotel twice and the venue and location are very good and and most definitely will book there on future stays in bcn staff are very friendly and professional however the check out surprisingly was a bit chaotic due to people leaving and coming also this was maybe a one off but from am the corridors were very noisy with the cleaning staff singing and talking obviously i am not saying that people should not be singing wiles working but perhaps a bit less louder saying all this and despite the above i will definitely stay there again and i recommend to those who wish to go bnc to stay there the little things i mentioned i believe were a one off
