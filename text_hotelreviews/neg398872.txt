the door to the balcony was broken and was not able to close it i didn t like the front desk trying to sell me an upgrade to a balcony room for more and actually my room has a balcony staff didn t explain clearly that the discount breakfast buffet only applies if we buy our breakfast buffet two days consecutively my opinion is bs they are just trying to make more money out of us the worse thing is their breakfast buffet the food was terrible for a euro buffet breakfast the bacon the sausages were aweful i am not picky about food and to me spitting out food is sinful i had to spit out a bite of the cheesecake it was so old it crumbled and watery i feel like the hotel is trying to make as much money as possible from the tourist it was not a cheap room i paid over euro per night by the way the main entrance does not look grand
