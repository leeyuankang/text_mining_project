the staff especially the main lobby receptionist had a bad attitude with her guests and other staff members she was bickering towards the maintenance guy in front of us about a stapler one other night we requested an additional bed and jordi who was working that night gave no solution and with a bad attitude responded that he could not do anything about it that we should have called earlier
