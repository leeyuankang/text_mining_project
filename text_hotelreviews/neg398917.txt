as a new hotel they are trying to attract more customers by giving quite competitive rates however the capacity to absorb these customers is questionable first night we stayed in a room with very noisy ac after second night i realised we were given actually a different smaller room from what we booked staff was generally nice and helpful except one supervisor at reception who to my opinion was demotivating to her more junior colleagues and absolutely not helpful friendly to guests to say the least
