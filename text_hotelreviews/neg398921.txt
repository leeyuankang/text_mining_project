everything was nice expect the receptionists my parents needed to change to a different room because i left after two nights staying with them the receptionist told me i can upgrade their room for more per night with breakfast then when i helped my parents check in to the new room the next day another receptionist who did the check in told me that the upgrade is free but breakfast was not included finally when my parents checked out the third receptionist told them it was still more per night with breakfast i mean seriously you guys were nice but this is just too messed up
