if i m being really picky cooked breakfast was a bit cold and too much salt bath towels could be bigger we had a very early departure before breakfast and were not told we could have a take out breakfast although the reception staff knew about our departure time because they booked our taxi for us we were still charged for the breakfast supplement though because it was part of the deal
