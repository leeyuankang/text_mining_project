the terrace bar is a good place for a drink but i don t recommend the tapas there there were two problems with the bathroom the light in the toilet room stopped working and on our last morning the head came off the hand held shower the light was fixed by the electrician and i assume the shower head was fixed after we left fortunately we were able to use the overhead rain shower
