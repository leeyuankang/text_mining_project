standard and superior rooms are small on request we were upgraded to what must have been a junior suite which was very comfortable the views from the rooms we saw were severely obscured by large metal panels added for architectural effect and certainly not for the benefit of residents the only way to get fresh air in the rooms was to open a large window door by a very small amount for safety reasons the window was kept locked and we had to ask many times for it to be re opened an annoying detail and a consequence of poor building design
