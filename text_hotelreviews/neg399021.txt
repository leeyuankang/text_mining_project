however unfortunately after we left the hotel they charged our card without notification for items we had already declared at check out and paid for in addition they did not give us the option to pay our bill in the local currency instead deciding unilaterally that they would charge us in pounds sterling up until that point we had enjoyed our stay but this changed things and i would now think twice before staying there again
