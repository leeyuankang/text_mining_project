my problem with the place is this a we only rented this for the pool so for three nights night the pool was closed because of a very very loud dj party it was techno music so was extremely loud shutting windows and doors doesn t work the heavy bass just beats through this went on until i didn t care so much about the noise but i cared about not using the pool during the day we are out touring the city so coming back and night looking forward to a dip in the pool was denied not happy at all particularly for how much we paid and that we had several children that were disappointed also a few of the bartenders were really absent minded like severely a few times we were the only ones ordering like drinks and were forgotten or the one time i ordered a glass of wine while waiting minutes then i just give up and leave and i was the only one at the bar it was all done with a smile of course other simply strange stuff was the fact our room was never cleaned until like pm on the and last day of our stay or after we checked in a worker came in to check the mini bar she didn t ask she just came right in i was half dressed my wife was in the bathroom and she went in there too she was very nice attractive young lady who was in no way disrespectful but she was just doing her job they didn t clean the rooms but made sure to check the mini bar religiously every day also we got in early and asked ahead of time for early check in i was told that the cleaner singular not plural does not arrive until noon therefore they will check us in after she cleans each room so of our rooms we had staggered check ins kind of strange and not very easy if you are a hotel that has guests coming in from overnight flights perhaps you should have your cleaner s come in earlier
