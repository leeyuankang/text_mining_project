although the bathroom was of a top standard the entrance to the bathroom is a glass partition with a large gap rather than a door this meant the bathroom was basically in the same room as the bed giving you had no privacy when using the facilities everything can be heard clearly throughout the room the pool was excellent and would be great in summer but we were a bit disappointed it wasn t heated during the spring months we visited in april when the weather was warm enough to sunbathe but the pool was ice cold and put people off using it
