i honestly couldn t fault the hotel on staff service cleanliness and so on but i did have one issue with the room layout the hotel looks brand new but i suspect whoever was the architect of the refurbishment or build hadn t actually tried sharing a room with someone before submitting the final plans the bathroom door was in the wrong place for me imagine looking from bottom of bed two feet to the right in the middle of the bed is the door to the bathroom literally stand up and you are at bathroom door not an issue i hear those of frequent visits through the night the problem is the the light switch is on outside and the room is illuminated with reject floodlights from the nou camp there is not a chance of your partner sleeping through an early morning relief visit other than that small criticism we loved our visit to the k k picasso in barcelona
