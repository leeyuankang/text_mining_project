two things that would need improvement are a asked one of the front desk staff some time our or night about how much was the cab fare to the airport i found it strange that he said he did not know since it is a pretty standard question the next day the check out agent told us it was about b for some reason the room attendant took one of the throw pillows on day and did not put it back on day our cups were taken and we had to ask room service to send to us because it was also not replaced as well
