i encountered reception staff during my stay there they were all surly and gave me the impression they would much prefer it they did not have to deal with me the reception desk was unattended one evening and when the receptionist eventually came from a room at the rear she was still eating when she spoke to me it was quite clear she had been enjoying a glass of rioja with her meal the pair of well worn trainers she was wearing certainly did not go well with the uniform she was attired in either i asked her what night bus serviced the area of sants she just shrugged her shoulders and said she did not know i would normally only comment on staff if the my expierence has been positive but in this case i feel i need to make an exception the room was quite small with one of those bathrooms that are not separated from the sleeping area by an actual bathroom door just a narrow sliding door to get to the wardrobe you had to pass through this area all a bit fiddly
