you when i booked with your company on line you showed me pictures of a room i thought i was getting and paying for and then when we arrived that s room was booked and the staff told me we could only book the villa suite theough them directly which was completely false advertising after being there we realised that you have grouped lots of rooms on the photos together leaving me the consumer confused and extreamly disgruntled especially as its my my wife s birthday present please make your website more clear through pricing and photos as again i didn t really know what i was paying for and how much it had wnded up being your photos told me i was getting something i wasn t not happy and won t be using you again
