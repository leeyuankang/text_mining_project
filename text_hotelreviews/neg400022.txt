some staff in the pool area seemed very standoffish and stared at you asif you didn t belong there when we checked out at the shower facilities in the gym were unfortuately unavailable due to rennovations which obviously can t be helped although the food and drinks were very nice euros for a plate of nachos was hard to justify also abit ridiculous that you have to pay to reserve a bed when there were clearly empty beds around the pool the day after we tried to get a bed we were told on our first day we had to reserve so we reserved for our second day
