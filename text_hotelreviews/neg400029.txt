this hotel was very busy with lines and waits at every turn the executive lounge was full at each meal with lines for every item the staff worked hard but waits and lines were the norm despite that the pool is not run by the hilton but by a third party and is much more of a nightclub than a family setting everyone was friendly and efficient but the hotel felt too impersonal with such large groups and delays
