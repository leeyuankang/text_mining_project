the room we had was a disabled room and totally unsuitable for older couples as only a silly shower over bath and this sprayed everywhere making the floor wet and very slippery we were very disappointed that with such a large bathroom there was no walk in shower to make life easier at the price of the hotel we felt it very inadequate as no where to put toothbrushes soap etc near the basin not cleaned very well and the hot drink top ups of milk were not done light in wadrobe would not turn off altogether sadly lacking
