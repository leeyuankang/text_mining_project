late check in i had to check in at un beliavable i wait at the reception from to and they didn t want to give me a room incredible swiming pool best seats in the pool are for the clients that comes from out of the hotel so if you spend in the hotel you will have an uncomfortable plastic hamncok far away from the swimming pool if you are an out side client you juust need to make a reservation and will have an amaizing hamncok in front of the swimming pool so its first hotel in the room that they priorize the clients from outside that the clients that stay in the hotel very far away from the center the beach near the hotel has special place for dogs so the beach is really dirty and smelly
