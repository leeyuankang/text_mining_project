there were workmen outside my door for a day they stayed much longer than they said they would and started early in the morning so i had two days of disturbed sleep and smell in the corridor the management were difficult to get hold of to resolve the issue it was only when i rang hilton to complain from inside the hotel that anything happened they have just charged my card in error two weeks after i left the hotel and hilton customer services first put the phone down and second insist that i phone the hotel internationally to resolve it directly with the them guests don t get full access to the swimming pool without paying extra and the whole place is fairly tired dated and noisy they didn t give me the room i had booked the one i was given initially didn t have the amenities on it as described i ve travelled a lot and this is as bad as it gets
