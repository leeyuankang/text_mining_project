the pool site is actually a puro beach urban resort where they let non hotel guests in puro beach staff treat hotel guests like dirt i have been repeatedly harassed by the telling me that i need to make a reservation and pay for a sun bed which i refused and they managed to find me a free sun bed on sunday the pool area was completely unavailable to the hotel guests as there was an external party going on definitely not the right place if you are looking for a relaxing experience any of the other hotels nearby would make a much better choice would never stay again also worth mentioning that the internet charges were atrocious to the point that it was actually much cheaper to run in roaming on my phone
