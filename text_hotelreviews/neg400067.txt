a pretty standard experience for the price other hotels offer more modern updated and stylish rooms and services at better prices i had pre approvals go off my account one when i checked in amount expected and the next morning for double the amount so in total times what i was due to pay my credit card was frozen due to this and as i am travelling on business and use my personal credit card this caused inconvenience the hotel also didn t offer much of an explanation and the amounts have not been cleared off my account yet keeping my available credit hostage
