no communication between hotel and the booking com non of our requests were taken into account and eventhough we booked a room for adults and one child we were provided with room with only one bed reception staff was highly unprofessional all trainees who provided us at first a matreess to put on the floor for our year old daughter when we finally got to a proper reception staff who was very professional we finally got the room we were supposed to get however this has spoiled our experience completely parking is outrageously expensive eur day
