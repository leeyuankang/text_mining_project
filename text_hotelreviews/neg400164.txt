the room was too hot even after i had turned the heating off and opened the windows it was still too hot to be able to sleep comfortably even after days also i had not booked breakfast at the time i booked so the staff tried to increase the price of breakfast from to euros each per night as a result we ate breakfast elsewhere every morning for about euros each
