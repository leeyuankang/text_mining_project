booked a room without breakfast the booking confirmation said breakfast costs per person per night the staff member at check in said the same the staff member at check out insisted i pay for the breakfast explaining that would have been the price if i had booked the breakfast on the internet and that her colleague at check in must have got it wrong call it what you may this kind of behaviour is reason enough for me never to return whatever the other merits of this hotel are
