wi fi signal is poor the first night we could not get an ip address at all and we had to call the reception their solution had been to restart the router thus cutting the connection for other guests the room is big but there is no attention to details e g the curtain in our room had multiple little cuts the plug of the main lamp was broken and not safe in my opinion the poorly written hotel directory did not even contain all services available at the hotel as you read them on the website not a star level room
