the noise of the clinging flag posts in the front as soon as there is a little bit of wind they know this since more than a decade and did not manage to control the noise especially at night it is like constant church bells ringing there is no service on the terrace although it is on the same level as the breakfast buffet and the kitchen the web info is not quite clear as to where the actual hotel entrance is i had to carry my luggage down a hill with a long staircase there is a slightly easier way through the back garden but you will not discover this when you arrive late
