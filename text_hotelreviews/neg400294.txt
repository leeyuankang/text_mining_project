we booked well in advance and yet were assigned a ground floor room ooking out into a dark and unattractive utility area we went back to front desk and attendant was so kind thank goodness they were able to move us to a sixth floor room with lovely view of square there was some foot traffic noise from restaurant above us at night but was worth it to be in nicer room
