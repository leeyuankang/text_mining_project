rooms were small and the furnishings tired not worth the per night price tag there were drainage problems with the bathroom too the hotel failed to tell us that on the saturday night they had a private party using the roof terrace bar and restaurant facilities from given this was a feature of the hotel it was poor that we were not noted on arrival of this we were even turned away from using the restaurant at lunch because all the staff were preparing for that evenings private event staff were un applogetic for any short comings and there was inconsistency in service and treatment amongst our group would not recommend this hotel and it s not worthy of a star rating it needs to up it s service and attention to detail
