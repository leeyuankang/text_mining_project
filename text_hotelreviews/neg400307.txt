we went for a meal on the friday night and had to hail a taxi the doorman concierge that night was not very helpful he got us a taxi but on the other side of the road and it was pouring with rain so i had to sprint across the road to get the taxi whilst my partner got stuck on the other side in the rain for a good couple of minutes the hotel has loads of umbrellas i saw them in the luggage storage room when we were collecting our bags on the last day but no one offered us one to borrow for the evening so we got soaked going to abac so that wasn t the best start to that evening
