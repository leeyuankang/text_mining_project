i expected to be able to make myself a coffee in my room but there was no kettle eventually after a request one arrived but with an english plug it came without coffee rather nasty nescafe packets milk and a teaspoon the milk was not replenished each day so had to keep asking small thing but very irritating and poor service in a rather pricey hotel asked for a quiet room but still had to use earplugs on the floor not a great experience room was small and dull although the shower was good
