we had a junior suite which i felt focused more on style than convenience a sliding door arrangement for the wardrobe meant you could get to the drawers or to the hangers but not both at once and there were far too many giant pillows on the bed however there was nothing to actually spoil our stay the worst thing i can say is they didn t replenish the milk and coffee in our room
