complimentary bottle of water left in room on arrival it would have been nice to have a further complimentary bottle left in the room each day of our stay considering the star rating of the hotel only a coffee machine in room which did not work satisfactorily tepid temperature coffee only no tea making option the fabulous large bath was very slippery and awkward to step into and out of would benefit from grab handles being mounted on bath and or wall
