the plumbing our bathroom a suite was very poor the bath would not empty without manually pulling out the plug electronic system failed and the water would not drain away in the shower when we called only the previous day we booked dinner for in the chinese restaurant we checked this when we checked in and then when we arrived they said they did not open till we complained at reception but the manager was not interested we managed to get a table on the roof terrace where the maitre de was more interested in having his photograph taken with a scantily dressed girl than in looking after us the corridor to the room smelt overpoweringly on joss sticks overall an unsatisfactory experience
