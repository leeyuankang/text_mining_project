upon taking a shower an odor of mould were lingering around the bathroom at first i tried to ignore it second time the smell was even stronger i leaned down and saw lots of mould under the edge of the bath tub disgusting and not acceptable for a so called hotel i want to clarify that this has nothing to do with the cleaniness as the cleaning team did a terrific job and there s no way to clean and hide mould anyway
