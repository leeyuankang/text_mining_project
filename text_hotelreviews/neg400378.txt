it was a very disappointing experience we were looking forward to a star experience and instead were shocked to find out what it was like firstly one room we requested was a double bed instead of twin beds even though we booked almost four months ahead and ironically we found out later our friend got a twin room when she requested a double bed we were shocked to discover the pictures do not represent the rooms at allll the rooms are way smaller than they appear all those additional sections in the pics are nonexistent even the junior suite my friend booked turned out to be half the size not to mention the constant noise from the housekeeping all day secondly we requested smoking rooms and found out on arrival that it s a nonsmoking hotel even though i called to confirm my booking the day before none of my requests were said to be unavailable the staff did little to nothing to accommodate our stay excluding the doorman he was a sweetheart
