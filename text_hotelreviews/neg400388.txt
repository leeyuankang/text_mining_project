we asked for a o clock check in and had to wait until o clock when we arrived in the room it was single beds and we asked for a king size bed on the booking this was asked to staff on arrival and the night we slept apart the day after my partner went down to reception and they pushed the beds together we should only have to request this once as this was what we had booked in the first place the breakfast is also overpriced
