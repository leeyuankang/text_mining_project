the hotel is of an excellent standard in every department but there was one thing that let it down unnecessarily the breakfast it was inconsistent with all other aspects of the hotel we came to breakfast just after and there was no bread left no bowls for the fruit salad at the buffet empty boards with no ham and almost no cheese left so we could not serve ourselves at the buffet nobody came to our table or the table next to us to offer coffee or menus for mins in this small breakfast area i asked a lady for some service and to stock up the buffet nothing happened for a further mins so we left and went every day to the excellent bakery round the corner instead mins walk from the hotel i would have gladly paid the euros per person each morning but i needed a better reason don t let your guests take their money round the corner otherwise everything was great
