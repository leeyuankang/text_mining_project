room was not like the advertisement it had a large wall that narrowed the space considerably and it had little light the internals of the hotel have odd angles that impact on the rooms i asked for another room and they showed me one that had very little space around the bed with no window seriously after spending that much money you are expecting a reasonable room they need to photograph these other rooms with no window and small spaces and let people decide false advertising i ask to get light fixed times with no response room lighting is poor the pool looks like it s deep in the picture but it is only up to your waist
