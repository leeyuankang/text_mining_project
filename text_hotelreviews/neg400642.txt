the rooms are not well distributed in general nowhere to really put your clothes no place to hang your towels there is an obvious lack of practicality that makes your everyday stay a bit more difficult it s an ok hotel for a day but if you stay for a few days and arrive with a suitcase it is not the place to choose the swimming pool is very small and full of kids screaming playing and jumping not a place for couples at all
