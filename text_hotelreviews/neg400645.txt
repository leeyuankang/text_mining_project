the whole experience began on a negative note the check in process was awful with the staff being extremely unhelpful we arrived an hour before check in and were told not asked to wait at check in time after queuing for minutes we were again told to wait as the room was not ready we were only given our room an hour after the official check in the room was clean but hot and muggy as the air conditioning had not been switched on for reasons of economy i presume while waiting in the lobby we ordered a pizza which turned out to be a burnt and dry piece of dough with remnants of tomato sauce and burnt cheese the next morning the room service breakfast we ordered was not much better during the night the sink in the toilet leaked and all the towels were soaking wet the hotel gets very noisy in the morning and even though there is no noise from the street the sounds from the corridors are very annoying to end it all when we requested a late check out we were told that to remain in the room an extra charge of euros would be incurred needless to say they quickly changed their tune after they were reminded of the check in debacle i understand that the hotel is very busy but surely staff at the front desk should be trained to handle things better
