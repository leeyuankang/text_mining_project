we have booked a junior sweet with a private pool however we have been given our request but was on the floor and the elevator just reach the floor so we had to go to the stairs to reach our room imagine with a trolley how it would look like once i had to call the reception to clean the room while we are going out we came back and found that nothing has been cleaned no free water is offered to us the pool is a joke square very small one and not worth it to be called a pool i strongly don t recommend this hotel to any one
