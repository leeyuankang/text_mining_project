cleaning wasn t so great had to call multiple times to get my room re serviced because it wasn t clean once a dirty pillowcase had been put back on pillow after room service the excuse every time was that bed linen only gets changed every days in a star hotel i ve been to other star hotels where that hasn t been the case if something is dirty it should be changed if a room is serviced nothing should be left there if its not clean room furniture was outdated too
