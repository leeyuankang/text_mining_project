when i booked the room the hotel said their was private parking and a reservation was not necessary however when i arrived i was told the parking was full and i would have to park at one of the nearby public parking facilities which cost euros per day another catch is that a lot of establishments in europe now offer you the option to pay in dollars or euros i went for the dollars thinking that i wouldn t have to pay the foreign exchange fee on my credit card however when i saw the total for the bill i ended up paying almost twice as much on the exchange rate as i would have if i used my card when you are offered this option at any establishment in europe don t fall for it its a rip off
