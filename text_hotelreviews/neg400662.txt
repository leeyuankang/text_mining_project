swimming pool is very poor in my opinion the area is small and many guests were there air conditioning in the room was shut down during the midnight i was not sure if hotel wants to save the energy or to be green in this case however the temperature was super high in barcelona it was unacceptable we did not call fd coz we were very tired during the trip before we checked out around the air co was still shut down to save a luggage before check in the reception told us to wait for housekeeper then we were standing and waiting in lobby for mins omg
