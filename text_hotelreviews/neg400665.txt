staff are unprofessional and its not a four star hotel service which you will expect during check in i was asking to check the room size as we are a family and if the size is small since they are advertising the room sizes on the reception in case you want to upgrade i will upgrade for a suite room and will pay the difference the answer was for the receptionist sabrina that you can t check the room and there is no availabity and i have to pay the whole stay in advance i informed her that in this case i will cancel if i can t check it and according to booking com free cancellation policy i will cancel the other nights and i will be charged first night she was arguing that i can t cancel in arugent way until i showed her the policy she checked with the manager and the reply was that the room is large no need to upgrade and left other staff was hearing and informed that it s ok if he check the room and sorted this out but she was totally unhappy and after accepting the room and doing the check in she didn t explain anything about the hotel as other staff were explaining regarding the outlets discounts for other guests and put the keys and left i was waiting my bags from the concierge room and same receptionist were arguing with couple booked dbl room and they got twin bed and she was arguing with them that that s what available only i traveled all around the world and first time i see a hotel who only place amenties shampoo soaps only on check in and won t replace or add new on second day as per the housekeeping which i asked for shampoo and her reply is we can t give as per the policy sorry but even toilet papers i have to go out in the corridor and get from the housekeeping staff who were cleaning other room as it s was over and was not refil second day even after cleaning the room
