we were very kindly offered an upgraded room which was fantastic only for reception to ring us the next morning saying a mistake was made and our room had since been sold and that we would have to move with minutes noticed this involved us having to repack and move all of our stuff to rub salt in the wounds we were then told our new room would not be ready till after lunch we then missed our pickup time for an day trip due to the time it took us to repack and move our luggage to the reception far from happy from this experience
