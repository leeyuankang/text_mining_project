we booked a triple room and we paid for three nights they also took a deposit out of my account on the first day without telling me i thought this was very expensive especially seeing as this did not even include breakfast we were told that if we wanted breakfast it would cost per person per day for breakfast for three people each day i don t think so one thing that really bothered me was the fact that one of our beds was an extremely uncomfortable pull out couch this was not mentioned to us when booking i had asked for three single beds and not once was it mentioned that one of these beds would be a couch as well as this there was no tourist information in the foyer so we had to guess where to go to eat sight see the biggest issue was the price and the pullout bed too expensive for a average hotel
