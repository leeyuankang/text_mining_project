almost everything else the service was very poor and this ruined my holiday my rubbish from the bins in my room and bathroom were not cleared for days my children s bed was never made room service would just roll the sofa bed up with an unmade bed with previous days crumbs and dirty sheets i called room service and no response in the end i had to go to the reception the management of this hotel is of a low standard they didn t even seem concerned that i didn t enjoy my stay and that i had a bad stay
