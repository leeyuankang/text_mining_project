heated pool was not heated body temperature is and the pool is spent a lot of money to have a heated pool only to look at it cause it was absolutely freezing weather may have been poor but if it is heated like the advertisement says that shouldn t be a problem staff weren t too helpful when i tried to bring this up with them i work in a hotel and we would have done more to reimburse a custom for their dissatisfaction over a mistake we made in advertising it s false advertising and i expected more to compensate
