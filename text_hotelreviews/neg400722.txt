when booking my search was specifically for a central hotel with parking provided the booking said parking is possible on site reservation is not needed and costs per day however when we arrived having to leave the car in a loading bay the receptionist seemed surprised we wanted parking and could only direct us to nearby public parking buildings costing either or euros per day
