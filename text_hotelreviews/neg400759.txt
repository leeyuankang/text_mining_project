set up of the floor and how to get there is a bit difficult lifts dont go to all rooms although we were very late arrivals i asked them to set out the room keys in alphabetical order with the welcome drinks at the dinner venue but this was not done when i arrived all the room keys were handed to me and it was chaos in the small foyer with the luggage and people and me trying to give room keys to people otherwise it was ok gracias
