when i booked i selected a twin room and thought because i d searched for people that this was what i got it said for twin room so i booked then on checking it said that i could only have one person it would cost extra for the second person i felt this was not required as the room was a twin room we paid it but would ve preferred not to pay the person supplement maybe this was my mistake but it was frustrating dealing with the hotel directly trying to resolve it by email sangria jugs by the pool are nice but we both thought they weren t very strong so a bit of a waste of money go for the cocktails instead
