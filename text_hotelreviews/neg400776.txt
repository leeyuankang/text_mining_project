my boyfriend and i went to the spa at various times throughout the day and each and every time there was a sign there that said please do not disturb doing a massage in the back but the sign literally never moved i m convinced only one person was on shift both days or something because whomever was never at the desk i also had trouble with room service to order pizza and it took an hour of our request for an hour to be fulfilled so getting things done in a timely fashion when it comes to room service wasn t the best
