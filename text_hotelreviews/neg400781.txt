the location is very noisy i had real trubbles having some rest in the night the price was very high for example they will charge you with euros for one breckfast they also charged me with euros for checking out hour after a clock and not to mention that if you take something from the minibar they try to put thinghs on your bill that you haven t consumed for example they ve put one wiskey on my bill and charged me with euros i don t drink wiskey so i figured out overall it was a big disappointment this hotel and to be honest their last star from their four stars doesn t shine very much i don t recommend it
