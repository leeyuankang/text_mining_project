check in was rather slow but the gentleman who eventually attended to us was friendly i sent an email a week before arriving requesting a room facing the back road of the hotel which i did not get i was told it was fully booked those rooms are best as they are quite huge comfortable and quieter it really gives you the feel of city living in barcelona the room i was given was facing the pool it was so small and tiny which isn t worth the money spent a bit disappointing but okay
