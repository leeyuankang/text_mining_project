i did not like how the management handled my complient i have especially asked for a king size bed there were a drop box that let me choose which bed i should take for rooms after arriving in the hotel they asked that i have to pay the full amount upfront before staying which is not very common anyways i did not complain and i said ok they gave us the key and let us take our bags to the rooms as we were entered the room one of us got a king size bed and i got a twin bed room i went to the hotel reception and i told them that there is a mistake i choose a king size bed online they did not mention anything about based on availability so i said i am sorry the reason why i choose two rooms instead of one for me and my friend is to actually have a king size bed and what really angered me is that they took everything upfront without even telling me that there is no king size bed so i would ve canceled it and share a room with my friend so i told the receptionist that i want to speak to the manager she said there is no one he already left i m like well if he is gone than you are in charge she said no im not than i m again saying who is she said no one is in charge so i asked if i could talk to the manager she went for a bit and came with the most ridiculous offer i quote her well since there is no king size room i would like to offer you a different room with a higher price i m like are you serious instead of compensating me your offer me to pay extra than again with a rude looks and her colleagues came trying to convince me to stay in a twin bed room without even letting me cancel my room and share the second room with my friend after minutes she said she will call her manager which i think was inside but did not want to talk to me saying we found a room for you and she handed me the key with a very bad manners anyways i took the keys and stayed in my room
