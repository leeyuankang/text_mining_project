very poor maintenance we stayed in madrid and malaga before coming to barcelona this was the most expensive amongst our hotels had booked a superior room with terrace and private pool and a superior triple room for kids the filter was not working in the pool and it was dirty the water from the shower was leaking into the bedroom the kids room was large and spacious but stinking of cigarettes despite being a non smoking room had to shift to standard rooms and getting a refund from the hotel was a challenge sadly could not find any other hotels and had paid for the rooms upon check in otherwise would have changed my hotel the reception staff was quite decent they had allocated us their best rooms but the cleaning staff does not do their jobs it is a very busy hotel with lots of people checking in and out service needs substantial improvement
