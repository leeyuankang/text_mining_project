euro for breakfast was asking a lot when you are already paying per person per night even if it is a star hotel in the heart of the city so we went to the various cafe s around for breakfast each day for half the cost for example there is a costa across the road travelling with teenagers means this turns out to be a bonus as they can have a lie in without having to get up for breakfast we did have an issue when we arrived with the room types doubles vs twins but the hotel management and reception staff did resolve it not easy given the challenge of a full hotel which turned a negative start back to a positive overall as a typical middle class family with elder kids i would not pay the extra you do to book star hotel in the heart of a major city again as i think that puts expectations of service levels into your head that is difficult for any hotel to match maybe the whole experience ends up being a neutral whatever feeling hope this makes sense you never walk away feeling it was value for money overall to me the catalonia ramblas was a bit better than ok a bit below being good
