there was plenty of front desk staff but not enough cleaning staff i assume we had a check in time we got there at to check in and they still weren t ready for us we waited minutes and they still weren t ready for us at we were so angry because we had a tour at so we told them we would come back we toured the city ate dinner etc and came back at only to find another minute wait at the front desk even though i had already filled out the paperwork we were tired from the day and furious with this we saw other people furious with their delayed check in as well hotel is nice but i don t think i could deal with that again
