staff were awful we had a situation were a stranger was able to come in from the streets to our floor on the hotel and manage to get into our room and take our room key as a young group of girls travelling together away from home this was an awful experience one male member of staff made us feel so uncomfortable as if it was our fault where as the security of the hotel was purely to blame the situation was controlled by two lovely female members of staff but other than that the rest of the staff were very rude and tried to brush off what had happened paying such money to stay in a hotel this should never happen and the only consolation we were offered was a free glass of cava at the bar which you could buy a bottle of at the local supermarket for as cheap as over all the staff were rude and unwelcoming
