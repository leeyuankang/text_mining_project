unfortunately i had my purse phone stolen whilst in barcelona when i got back to the hotel i sought help from the receptionist who was extremely dismissive i needed to use their phone to call re cancelling my bank cards and he proceeded to tell me that i had to use the phone in my room which would cost me money he was very rude and unhelpful and i will be writing a letter of complaint to the hotel
