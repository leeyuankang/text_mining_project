i specifically booked this hotel because there were three of us going and the hotel offered single beds as opposed to singles and a sofa bed the room we got was noisy swimming pool area under construction and we got singles and a sofa bed we were moved to another room but this time the spare bed had no blankets or pillows we highlighted this on our way out for the evening but they sill were not there on our return the guy at reception said there was nothing he could do housekeeping was gone home we told him to leave the blankets and pillow on the bed and we would make it ourselves we highlighted the problem at reception the next day but i m afraid despite a good will gesture of a bottle of cava we could not recommend this hotel another evening we asked for room service and again there was a problem with that so we didn t bother
