we didn t think the service was very good in the reception we were ignored by some of the staff whilst waiting for help with directions the staff were very unfriendly and unhelpful they did not have any information about restaurants they could recommend they didn t offer to make reservations or book taxis etc we would have liked to use the bar but there was no one to serve us we asked at reception if anyone was available to serve us in the bar but no one came in general bad unfriendly service very snooty staff
