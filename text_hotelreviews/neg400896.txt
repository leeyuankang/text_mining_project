we ordered a junior suite with private pool we where told over the phone this had a separate room area where an extra bed for our daughter be set up upon arrival at checkin this was once more confirmed by staff but after paying when entering the room this was not the case instead of trying to find a resolution the staff seems to find pride in arguing with me which was not helpful in the end i spoke to a very polite front office manager who was unable to solve the problem but kindly tried to made amends by offering free perks like free breakfast and late checkout service seems to be something the hotel needs to pick up on in general as when i tried to order room service a similar situation occurred again where seemingly in house room service was closed and staff spent so much time argumenting about this that they failed to effciciently direct me to external room service which then meanwhile also had closed strangely only minutes after the internal one so no food after which is very strange in spain in other news the general outdoor pool and restaurant where closed for refurbishing the private pool in the suite is not heated so to cold for use
