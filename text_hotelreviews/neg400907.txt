the d cor in the hotel is all dark wood panelling and i found this a little overpowering not only in the corridors but the rooms too we spent most of our time with the lights on and no natural light in our room also didn t like the fact that they don t have their own restaurant for evening meals this is a restaurant open to the public although it is attached to the hotel also the price of the breakfast is a little steep
