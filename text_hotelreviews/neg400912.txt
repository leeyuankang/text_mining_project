it was a terrible experience we got robbed as we were checking in at the reception desk there was no security guard at anytime nor doorman we had to wait for the general manager to check the video cameras clearly he could see how this thief went thru my purse in front of these hotel employees he said the hotel was not responsable for my stolen valuables it became very suspicious when both employees at the front desk claimed they did not see anything after seeing the thief in the video clearly we thought otherwise afterwards i was sent to the police station to make a formal claim i do not recommend this chain of hotels
