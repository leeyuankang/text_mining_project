the extra bed pull out sofa bed was very uncomfortable to sleep on i was surprised to see that we did not get what we had booked for which was double bed and single bed we instead got twin beds pushed together and a sofa cum bed the sofa bed was not actually a bed it was actually a very thin fold able mattress that gave me lower back pain after one nights sleep on it the three of us my parents and i ended up sleeping on the double bed which was luckily spacious enough for us three towards the end of our stay would not recommend anyone above to sleep on the extra bed
