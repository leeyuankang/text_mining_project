the check in process took a long time as there were not enough employees checking in the long line of arriving guests we could hear hallway noise through our door which wasn t a huge deal until the m saturday partiers next door hung out in the hall before entering their room i m not sure if this is a hotel known for partying but we also walked out to dinner past someone passed out on the floor outside our door at p m these incidences were not ideal and leave me feeling not enthused about the hotel
