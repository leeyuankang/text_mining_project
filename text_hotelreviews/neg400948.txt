the hotel is very large which i wouldn t mind but here is the problem when it is full it barely copes with the amount of guests it can accommodate it really does spoil the otherwise pleasant experience the restaurant at breakfast is so crowded that you have to wake up early to enjoy it the waiting time for check in and checkout at the reception easily exceeds minutes the pool area is so tiny that getting a sunbed is a great struck of luck
