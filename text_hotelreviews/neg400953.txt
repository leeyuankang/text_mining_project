the spa was closed on the day of our stay and when we said the staff could have let us know were told that it s just one of those things and we couldn t expect it to be open even though this was part of why we booked the room had some wear and year and let down by small things such as no milk for coffee and some our toiletries being throw out by housekeeping the reception staff were not very helpful
