we arrived to check in and were told the cleaners were in our room so we went for lunch then when we returned again we were told the previous guest was refusing to leave the room so we had to go out again we paid for a suite with pool and all the pictures on websites portray these to be on the top floor with a view ours was on the floor with a very small shabby balcony very disappointing for paying a premium rate and misleading too
