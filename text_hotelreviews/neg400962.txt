we decided to stay an extra night and the receptionist gave us a great deal but when we came to checkout the next day the young man tried to charge us the higher rate he said he thought it strange we were given that rate he kept going back to his supervisor and told us we had to pay the higher amount this all took half an hr and we had a long drive to madrid ahead of us finally after i got very upset he said ok he d give us the rate we d bn told originally it was not in my opinion the right way for hotel staff to deal with the situation we would never stay there again
