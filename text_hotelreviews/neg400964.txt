hotel room was a bit dark and as we were situated on the same level as the pool we had to keep our curtains closed so people couldn t see in this didn t help with the darkness of the room pool area got very busy at times and people reserved sunbeds with their belongings then left and didn t return for hours so much so we had to sit on the floor perhaps they should introduce a rule if you don t return to your sun lounger within an hour your stuff gets moved
