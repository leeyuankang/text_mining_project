no value for money to be had here shoe box of a room and lots and lots of issues as the hotel is brand new don t order room service it is simply not good if it was a three star at half the price then i would rate it all around bar room service for a four star hotel there is much better value to be gotten elsewhere ps the pool is tiny in the basement and next to the breakfast room not a pool that one wants to spend time in
