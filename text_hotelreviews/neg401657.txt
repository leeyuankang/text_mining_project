the location on a busy crossroad made the room very noisy when you opened a window when all windows were closed you couldn t hear the noise but we needed to open the windows to cool down the room at night as it was strangely hot in the room about degrees i would guess even though it was only about degrees outside we also experienced a lack of hot water on our last morning which was being looked into so i had to forgo a shower on my last morning before returning home
