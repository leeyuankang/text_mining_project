had to change rooms twice once because the bath had a chip in it the mirror had a big crack across it and the alternative room given was tiny for the price paid i feel the up keep of some of the rooms is quite poor given the star rating of the hotel we also had to pay to upgrade to a better room which i don t think was fair given the rooms we were offered originally and the quality of them
