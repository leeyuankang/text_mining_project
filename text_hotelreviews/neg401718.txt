it was unbearably hot in the room i was put in nathaniel butt and the window was open when i got in there so i assumed given that i couldn t find an ac dial and the hostess hadn t mentioned it that there was no way of adjusting the temperature this made it very difficult to sleep i was told the next day that the staff could adjust the temperature that should be made clear on arrival due to the window being open and this being an area surrounded by shops and restaurants a lot of deliveries were being taken nearby in the night that were very noisy again this made it very difficult to sleep there were also roadworks taking place directly below my window i understand that this is not the hotel s responsibility but it would have been better if they hadn t put me or any other guest in this room while the works are going on the lack of a shower while the bath was lovely it made it inefficient in terms of getting ready for work early in the morning and made a hot room even hotter overall really disappointing for the very high price point
