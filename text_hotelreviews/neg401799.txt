my only slight grumble is that there was no tea coffee tray in the room this lead to a confusion as we were ordering tea and coffee direct with reception and having it delivered to the conservatory which had an additional charge the staff sorted this all out once we realised our mistake and a tea tray was delivered to the room but i think it should have been there as standard initially this really did not detract from our stay though and i will certainly be returning to the hotel
