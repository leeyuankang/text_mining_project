i have used this hotel a few times before and never been disappointed however our room this time was quite shabby inside compared to previous visits there wasn t even any bottled water also on trying to find the room at after a long day the signage was very misleading and led us to a door which was closed off and unavailable due to construction we then had to get a member of staff to show us the alternative route which we would never have found had we followed the brass signage
