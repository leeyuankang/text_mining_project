the staff was kind but not necessarily overly welcoming the experience was what you might expect from a large chain we booked a family room via booking com my confirmation from the hotel showed one double room they quickly responded and assured me we had a family room what we actually had were two rooms next to each other absolutely great for us as our kids are older but families with younger kids might not have been happy we knew when we booked this hotel that it is in japan town it takes some searching to find non asian meals near by
