the room that i booked and fully paid before my arrival did not have air conditioning but only the fan the room has window and opens to the courtyard which is has no fresh air during my stay even the weather was around degrees celcius the room was unbearably hot i cannot imagine on a true summer day the booking com must be clear about these kind of lacks because i have asthma and i had the worst nights in my life another important issue that these kind of hotels located in the ancient buildings must be aware of their water pipe system during a minutes of shower i got burnt frozen many times
