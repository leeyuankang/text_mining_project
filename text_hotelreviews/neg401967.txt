housekeeping forgot to put towels in the room and a plastic garbage bag but each happened only once in a six night stay in addition the problems were swiftly taken care of the air conditioning was o k but somehow needed adjustment part of the time on occasion there was a loud sound which might have come from the plumbing or air conditioning potential guests should know that the hotel does not offer food after breakfast but only drinks and snacks however there are many many restaurants and cafes very close to the hotel however all this was minor compared to the pluses i would definitely stay here again and again
