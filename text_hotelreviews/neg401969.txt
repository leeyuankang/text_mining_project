the wifi connection is not very good particularly if you are on the higher floor i was on the floor i had difficulty with wifi connections to my laptop while having a room on a higher floor sounds good it is is better to be on a lower floor and stay very close to the modem and server to ensure good wifi connections the only way i could use my laptop was to sit in the bar area the other point is when making a reservation through booking com it is not made clear or obvious on the booking com site that not all the rooms at wandl come with air conditioning i only found this out at check in i then requested to change to rooms with air conditioning for which we had to pay extra i accepted the additional cost but i think booking com needs to make clear that not all rooms have air conditioning
