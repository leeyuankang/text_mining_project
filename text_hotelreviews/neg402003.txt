in my opinion it is a decent standard of hotel not brilliant but it s ok basics are key to a good stay for me ventilation and room temperature we visited in november and with no outside wall window window into the central courtyard of the building with no fresh air and the room was pretty warm pillows a basic point for me is that i need a decent pillow mine was really soft so i asked for a different one however they only have type of pillow pillows isn t the solution small point you may think but it s the difference between a good nights sleep and a great stay or not i believe a hotel should have more than type of pillow
