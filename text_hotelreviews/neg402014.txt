this was my most expensive hotel for night of austria and the smallest room i ever got in a four star hotel wolrdwide don t book here if you want a room for one person the room itself is fairly small the bathroom is even smaller if you are even a little obese you will be stuck on the toilet no bath just a shower no airco only a fan
