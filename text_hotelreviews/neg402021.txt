i think it is a serious problem that the rooms are not air conditioned the type and look of the hotel would imply a c so it is an unpleasant surprise in a hot day to find out it does not have a c nevertheless the room was very pleasant and i appreciated that the person at the reception upgraded my room to one with a street view thank you
