i stayed for four days during july in a so called business room it was degrees and there is no air condition in the entire hotel the room was boiling there is no free water or mini bar in the business room the king size bed were two single beds put together there is free wifi in the entire hotel but no reception in the room all in all the business room just felt like a bigger economy room the facilities of this hotel are not up to the century i would only recommend the place to a tourist traveling off season the hotel is not suitable if you are on a business trip or if you do not like you room to be a sauna
