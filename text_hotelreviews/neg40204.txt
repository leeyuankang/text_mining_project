the staff on the day of our arrival we are carrying heavy suitcases and the concierge hostess did not offer any help at all she walked us to our room with me and my mother trailing our heavy luggages to our door also the cleanliness of the room undoubtedly needs improvements on the day we checked in to the room we found hair and few visible dust on the bed linen worst of all other concierge lady didn t not make us feel welcomed i felt subtly racially discriminated and i ve lived abroad for more than years for us it s an unfortunate choice
