to be told that a turnaround time of hours for dry cleaning wa absolutely impossible was very disappointing when i walked to the dry cleaner myself at and was told the item could be collected in as little as hours the staff member made no effort to assist even though i made my desperation very clear she really let down my experience despite every other staff member being amazing my single room was tiny with a view of a brick wall i was unhappy about not being able to iron in my room when you travel for business this is not a luxury it is a necessity it was nice of the staff to allow me to iron downstairs but this was inconvenient
