in the moment of booking we asked for the room on the top floor with a view in the hotel we got the room on the floor the window faced the covered inner yard and it was rather stuffy cause there was no fresh air and no air condition just a vent on the ceiling the room is not spacious with a rather small shower room the double bed was just two single beds placed together with no single mattress and that was rather uncomfortable instant coffee for a breakfast is not suitable for hotel
