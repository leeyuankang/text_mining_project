the alarm at night but the staff made up for it and hopefully they can fix the glitch a very minor point they close the fire doors at night but i got up early one day and also during the alarm it s ok to push but there is no handle to pull those doors i opened by pulling the door stopper all the way at the top can add a handle for people to pull
