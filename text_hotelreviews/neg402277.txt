the sacher hotel is beautiful but over priced i think that the mini bar in the rooms should be free because of the high cost of the rooms and breakfast there was no drinking facilities in the room a couple of dirty marks on the carpet valance sheet and curtain the hotel is a luxury star hotel and therefore should be totally spotless if i pay for a excellent hotel i expect high standards in every area however on the whole it has been a fantastic city break
