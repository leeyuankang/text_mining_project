we asked for an early checkin in which did not happen actually our room was ready min after the normal check in time staff asked us to wait in the lobby for an hour and completely forgot us and only checked us in after we reminded them other guests were shown the facilities but we did not get an introduction to the restaurants and where the breakfast locations is credit card terminal did not work and other guests had the same experience finally the third credit card terminal worked it was a very bad start
