though i enjoyed the breakfast on the first day i found a hair in my eggs the second time i visited the restaurant the staff seemed oblivious about my complaint and asked me whether i wanted another set of poached eggs but i was just so turned off by the attitude i politely declined and left the restaurant i also requested a king size bed but was surprised to have two single beds joined together some of the staff seemed pretentious which was a disappointment it wasn t at all comfortable for the money they charge
