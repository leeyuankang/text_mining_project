the furniture in the top deluxe room is a bit outdated we asked for anti allergic pillows and duvets and it took quite a long time before the housekeeper came she just left them and took the other ones without making the bed again the majority of the guests are years old maybe not a really comfortable feeling for a family with a toddler
