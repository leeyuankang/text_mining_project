i wish there was a coffee machine in the suite the concierge staff were not friendly i greeted them most of the time but no one greet back while they should star with greetings or at least smile the pillows were low which was not good for neck support heating wasn t good enough in the suite although it was fine in the living room but was bad in the bedroom the bed was not a king or queen size bed but was two joined single beds the receptionist who handled our check out was cold not friendly but to be fear she wasn t rude
