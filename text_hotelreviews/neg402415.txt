our room had a hot water issue minutes later after initial call someone came to our room to confirm it wasn t working it then appeared to be a hotel wide issue further calls and a visit to reception over the next hour we were told it was fixed and would be working in mins that came and went we had cold showers and went for dinner just before we left the room the hot water came through that was disappointing but overall still a really good experience and would go back
