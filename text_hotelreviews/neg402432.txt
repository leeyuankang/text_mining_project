not picking here but this is what stood out no complimentary water not acceptable in a star hotel no ironing board in room noise didn t spoil my overall stay but did mean i struggled to get to sleep due external partying and so overslept and missed breakfast on the terrace twice shame the windows aren t soundproofed also drilling above my room in the day appreciate this is still a new hotel room while stunning inside has a view of another building
