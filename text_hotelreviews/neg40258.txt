there were many points that we didn t like as follows the hotel has confirmed that they could arrange not a duplex room to us prior to our arrival but unfortunately we got a duplex room regarding the duplex room there was no mirror and wardrobe on the upper floor whereas the shower was located on the upper deck i e after taking a shower we have to get change downstairs there was no electric socket for the use of hairdryer in the shower room the air conditioner vent was facing the pillows and we have to switch off the air conditioner when we went to bed on our stay morning there was some muddy water flushing out from the shower head this was ridiculous and at the end we were late for our meeting there was limited choice of the breakfast and the services was bad we ve ordered the salmon bagel and end up getting some bacon besides my husband ordered a boiled egg for each of us and at the end boiled eggs was served for each of us the scramble egg was dry and tasteless my husband felt sick and we asked the reception to call for the sos doctor and replied to us the expected arrival time of the doctor after mins no reply and we have to call back the reception to follow up with them after arriving i was unpacking and my husband was taking a shower on the upper deck of the room we heard someone came in and out of our room freely for a few times downstairs we were flustered locked the door and put the do not disturb sign out immediately all in all i was very surprised that this was claimed to be a stars hotel and extremely disappointed of this hotel there were a lot of rooms for improvement and this is so far the worse hotel that i had ever stayed
