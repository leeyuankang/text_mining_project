i had read a review from another reviewer that said their shower was leaking and water would leak outside of the door this happened to us in our room as well no matter what i did the water from the shower spilled out into the toilet area and there was nothing i could do to prevent the water from going out of the shower i agree with the reviewers that state this hotel should not be considered star i have stayed in many star hotels and this is not star level in my opinion
