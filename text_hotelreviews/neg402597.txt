the room was similar to the photos but a mini version they must have used trick photography we stayed in an ambassador suite which is very expensive but the room is pokey and grim oversized furniture made it impossible to move around comfortably the room was dark and felt old it was like being in a bunker extremely claustrophobic everything is old and outdated baby cot and high chair where old and had it no coffee machine in room i usually expect an espresso machine in a star suite pool was sad and had no atmosphere feels like being in a garage nothing is included in the price parking breakfast nothing we paid euro and had to add breakfast and parking really was expecting much much more we usually stay at palazzo parigi which is times better we tried this hotel for a change really wish we hadn t is really disappointing
