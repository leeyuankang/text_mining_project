the prices of items in the mini bar were ridiculous euro for a small bottle of water that costs at the store also the price of breakfast coffee for or was it euro i had delicious caffe macchiato and a delicious croissant in brera for a total of euro these kinds of rip offs are what turn me off certain hotels i guess if you are on an expense account you don t care but i do many luxury hotels are now offering these things included in the price i think that is the way forward the wifi was painfully slow also these two points were annoying but did not hamper my enjoyment of the hotel
