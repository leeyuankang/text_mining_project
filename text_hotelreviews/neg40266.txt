i thought the breakfast of person per night american was a bit exaggerated for what you got for that price i would ve assumed it would be a bit more maybe some cheese vegetables for the bread and not only marmalade the fruit salad was very small as well it would ve been nice with some berries like strawberries raspberries we tried it once then we had breakfast elsewhere the only other thing that i didn t like was that i asked for a late checkout we had to leave the hotel around so i emailed the hotel and asked prior to our arrival they said it wasn t possible with a checkout later than and if we wanted to stay in our room we had to pay for a whole night which is a significantly higher rate than we had on booking we did it because my mom wanted to stay comfortable in the same room and not leave the luggage in the hotel when we walked around until we had to leave for the airport but of course it feels a little weird paying for basically and a half hours more in the room even if it s a luxury hotel so i would advise anyone to look this up further if you want a late checkout if you don t want to pay this amount i understand that you have to pay for a late checkout anyways which is totally fine but i don t think it would ve cost for and a half hours in any hotel
