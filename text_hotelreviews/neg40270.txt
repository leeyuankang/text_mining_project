by far the worst experience i ever had in a hotel i booked this hotel convinced that it was a great deal for the location and the quantity of stars which most of the time equal comfort and relaxation big mistake i was welcomed by an unfriendly and full of attitude staff i had to order three times in order to get a quick breakfast juice and a toast just because it was late and they were getting ready the tables for lunch together with my friend we arrived quite late in the room after a whole day of tourism the room was stuffy smelling of sweat small and with an insect on the bed we complained and they gave us another room bigger but with no heat because they said the ac was broken the linen was rough and unaired and the room seemed like a hotel room than a we were really cold over the night and i personally had the worst sleep in a long time in the morning we tried to ask for some towels and water but we were attended by a staff that were hanging up the phone before even us finishing the sentence over all i would definitely not recommend this hotel
