i didn t care for the receptionists checking us in she actually discouraged me from reserving with booking com in the future stating that i would have benefited more from booking through the hotel directly i just doesn t make any sense to discredit my buying decision now that i m checking in if it wasn t for a reputable site like booking com i probably would have overlooked hotel marignan they should be grateful for their partnership with the online booking site also the room i booked was not the room i received i booked a room with a king bed and separate twin bed i got the room with two queen beds stuck together three major problems with this hotel no public access to the view that s so widely advertised on booking com unless you book the room with the view you will not have access to the patio the air conditioning is non functioning i get that it s cold at night but there needs to be some kind of ventilation in the room the only way to get air conditioning is you have to call the maintenance and they will turn on the air for the entire hotel if another guest complains of the air circulation they will turn it off the shower was horrible despite our best efforts not to splash the water quickly spread everywhere on the bathroom floor our towels were drenched from trying to build a barrier to not let the water seep through when we tried calling for additional towels it was a huge ordeal with the housekeeping staff the toiletries are old the formulas are practically separating i wouldn t recommend staying in this hotel especially if it s your first time in paris it will just piss you off
