i did not like the way i booked for a modern contemporary room and was given a classic and had to go to reception to ask them to change it as my room cost pounds more for this specific choice i also did not like fact that once they put me in the room i booked for the internet was not working well they also did not do the turn down service at night so when i returned to my room it was not nice and welcoming
