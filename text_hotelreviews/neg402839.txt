oh man the hotel is old actually i cannot tell if its really really old or they designed it to look old either way its not for me at least first they gave us joining rooms for our family rooms very really old and smelly you know the carpet smell so i figured they are renovating the rooms and some room doors are black which indicates renovated rooms i thought and i was right i asked the reception to change our rooms and so they did the new rooms are good really spacious the rooms were clean and had no smell the fitness is quiet small for that large of a hotel breakfast is mediocre try to get a space early in the morning as there are not enough seats
