room cleaning did not replace any amenities you needed to call to get them the bathroom smelled moldy or something if you are at all sensitive to these things the minibar was very very expensive we had a turkish bath in the suite why we did not have a walk in shower only a slippery bathtub not safe or comfortable and this was a suite the location was not good not bad not too far from the city center via tram no but at the edge of rather basic neighborhoods there are some bars and good restaurants near the hotel
