the restaurant was less than impressive clearing tables only after guests had left and the wheeling the trolley with dirty dishes past the tables not professional clear as the diners finish please if you are looking for a high hotel rating twice had to ask for the bill times and waited minutes before it cam food was mediocre at best felt like we were in a chain restaurant on the positive side the setting for the outdoor dining was very nice
