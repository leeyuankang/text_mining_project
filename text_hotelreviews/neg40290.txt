we were informed it would be a king sized bed not beds pushed together not exactly comfortable they couldn t even be bothered to clean the room when we moved in there were another ladies fake nails lying in the bathroom and all over the rooms floor underneath the bed certainly hadn t seen a hoover in as many weeks it was disgusting inside the wardrobe al though the disgusting habit of another probably previous guest had left chewing gum stuck inside the wardrobe all above was raised in a polite manner with reception they informed us they would have the room cleaned immediately when we returned they had presented a nice fruit platter a bottle of wine and an apology note which was a really nice thing to do but they had actually forgotten to clean the room it would have been nice to use the complimentary coffee and machine they provide for guest who pay the extra for the prestige room but as above not only do they forget to clean your room they forget about the coffee station also so not only unkept but un replenished the breakfast hours are fantastic till we thought this would be great unfortunately the breakfast area is only big enough to accommodate maybe rooms at time so best try and get there early as you may not be able to sit for breakfast or they may not be anything left after day we decided to eat out for breakfast it was just a disgrace
