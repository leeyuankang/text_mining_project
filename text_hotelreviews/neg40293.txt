service of the hotel was a huge issue during our stay we faced a lot of concerns related to the service which was offensive in many ways and makes you doubt visiting the hotel again although they have a good location rooms were nice but very empty like a business hotel and doesn t reflect the french luxury plus no main facilities restaurant very basic most of staff is new and they try their best but the much experienced supervisors lack the basics of service and hospitality the only thing that would make revisit the hotel is ms morgane who met me at the end of my stay to apologize which i highly appreciate
