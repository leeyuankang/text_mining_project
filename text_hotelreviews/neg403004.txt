unfortunately some of the other guests spoiled the dining experience for us as because as it was a buffet meal a lot of people seemed intent on eating as much as they could in a short space of time even though the staff kept refilling the trays of food on one occasion it took only seconds for two large trays of cakes to be devoured i would add that this is not the hotel or staffs fault
