we were given a family room on the floor directly facing the train station walls are not sound proof that evening we could hear every train that went by central station music and people talking from the street below the next day we complained to reception and was offered another room on level at rear of the building the room was much quieter unfortunately there was a drainage problem with the shower our bathroom was flooded we were offered another room very disappointed with the facilities of the hotel as we had spent the previous weeks in other cities in italy and stayed at hotels much older than the glam with no issues
