we were in the room but the house keeping only provided coffee sachets one of them decaf and no milk we paid for half board but the dinner wasn t worth it at all not good variety of food and if you arrive less than an hour after the dinner start time the good stuff in the buffet is finished and they don t provide more we had to have the same food every day i could have spared the half board money and had dinner at any good restaurant nearby
