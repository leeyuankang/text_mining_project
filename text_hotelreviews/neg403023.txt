staff have no idea about customer service breakfast and dinner were both a joke chaos to seat customers you felt like you were sitting in a corridor you can only have tea size plates otherwise you will be charged euros for waste i have never been in a hotel anywhere in the world that has stated this did not even get breakfast the second morning as power had gone out and staff did not offer us anything and no apology when i complained at the check out desk they even wanted my credit card details for a third time when i had paid in full on booking com and the staff member could not give me a reason why they didnt offer any compensation for not receiving the full service i paid for
