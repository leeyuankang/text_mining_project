we had the breakfast and dinner option the breakfast was alright with most of the usual options the evening meal was very plain it is advisable to get in early as all dishes are not kept supplied and you may find options limited very limited variety of sweet in fact there are more types of sweet offered at breakfast you also have to pay for drinks though we had already paid we opted to eat out mostly there is a coffee shop bar on the ground floor but it does not have anything to eat bathroom had a shower which could be hand held or overhead never did work out how to change from one to other overall a very disappointing stay and would never stay at a glam hotel again
