on the first night there was a fire alarm times at around had to go all the way down to the reception times as a result a sleepless night the bathtub would fill up with water while taking the shower and the water wouldn t go away has requested reception for consecutive days to fix the issue and send maintenance to unclog the pipes the problem was never fixed to be showering in the bathtub full of water is not only disgusting but dangerous as well
