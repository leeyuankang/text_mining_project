i arrived in a south facing room about pm on an afternoon when the sun had been and still was pouring in it was not possible to open the windows so i drew the curtains and switched on the air conditioning but the cool air came in just inside the door and was ineffective over the room as a whole over the rest of the day it reduced the temperature only by about degrees to the next morning i spoke to the woman doing up the rooms and asked her to leave the curtains closed she said it was hotel policy to leave them open i was surprised as i ve stayed in lots of places in italy and the usual practice is to keep shutters curtains closed against the sun even then the air con was not very effective the side of the bath was high and broad making it precarious to get into and there was no non slip base to the bath or grab handle probably fine for the young but a potential accident area or just not usable for some older people my room lights were not much good for reading i personally did not like the ultra modern decor
