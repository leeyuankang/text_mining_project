dinner included is a tourist trap the restaurant is awful the food quality is modest the dining room is not a proper room but a corridor the service very basic breakfast also feels plain didn t see any croissants or cutted fruits the juices are from a machine the hotel is modern and has good room decoration and furniture but the service management is bad our room had water infiltrations on the floor and smelled like moisture the maid entered the room at on a sunday without even knocking wouldnt recomend as there must be loads of alternatives for same price on milan
