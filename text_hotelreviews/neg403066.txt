these aren t major cons about the hotel but just a few things to be mindful of there is also a bit of traffic noise even on the floor it s mainly early morning so not too distracting while sleeping the main con i have is that for the nights we were there there was a problem with an electrical fault apparently outside of the hotel this caused a light in the entrance to our room to flick on and off through the night and one night stayed on for a few hours there is a door we were able to close but there was no advise or acknowledgement from staff as to how long this was going to go for after mentioning it to staff a few times with minimal response we decided not to worry about it and just keep the door closed for a light sleeper though it was distracting as the light still flashed through the grill in the bottom of the door not sure if this was just an issue while we were there or permanent
