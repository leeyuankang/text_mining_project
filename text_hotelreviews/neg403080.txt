every time i come to milan i book the hotel glam because of his many interesting points very close to all you need very clean reception always helpful the half pension offer is interesting but this time unfortunately and unexpected i was real disappointed sorry hotel glam but this time i have to say it i booked the hotel two weeks before my stay at over the double of it s normal prize and in the days of my stay the prize reached even five times the usual prize this so on the reception because the hotel was almost full and prizes are going up consequently i think this is a real shame because we were at the level of a five star top hotel like the four seasons for example the problem is that the service is not better if you pay times but worse maybe because of the fullness of the hotel the breakfast was not like the other times very poor we get a room where the air condition did not work i needed to solicit two times on the reception and answer the attendant is busy please be patient when he came he told only that some valve is obstructed and that he cannot do anything so we were forced to sleep in a hot room resulting in a sweatiness during all the night no thanks not for this prize for such prize i ve could book a star hotel without problem dear glam please review a little your politic i would still like to visit you the next times i m in milan but not at this conditions
