glam not really a bit tired feeling actually like someone who was glam in a tarty way a few years ago but hasn t moved on the breakfast buffet hot food was a bit painful the scrambled eggs were half cooked literally some cooked lumps with uncooked scrambled egg mix slopping round them and the bacon was most odd nothing like the decent thick rashers of back bacon in the uk plenty of fruit though and pastries sweet cakes cereal etc if that is more your thing you would be quite pleased no parking but public car parks nearby were ok although you had to leave your keys with attendant which feels uncomfortable another cost too compared to parking in hotel s own car park guess it is just the nature of a city centre hotel
