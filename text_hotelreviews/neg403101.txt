i loved the idea of a free buffet in the evening unfortunately drinks are not free in contrast to the breakfast and prices for water soda beer and wine are incredibly high as the food is quite salty and probably intentionally so i spent on drinks what i would have spent on a dinner in a restaurant elsewhere though this does not mean that the quality of the food isn t good in fact it is very good
