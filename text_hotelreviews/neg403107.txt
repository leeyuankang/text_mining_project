the room rates were jagged up three times more than the rate shown on booking com without asking we want to proceed with the booking the room rates were charged to our credit card before we arrived without any explanation on why and what it is for if the room rates were increased an email should be sent to us to ask if we want to proceed with the booking or choose any room with similar room rates as glam milano originally stated we paid for the room without a chance to reject it is cheating in my view
