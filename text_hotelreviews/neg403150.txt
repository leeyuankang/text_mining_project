booked a double room but got a twin room i e two single beds instead of one queen king bed i was arriving late and too sleepy and tired to go back down argue etc so had to live with that the room was not properly cleaned there were someone s long hairs in the bathroom and something sticky on the tea mug and teaspoon the breakfast is okay but not impressive at this price and given them claiming to be a four star hotel thing could have been much better otherwise and up to me it is a decent three star hotel at a very high price
