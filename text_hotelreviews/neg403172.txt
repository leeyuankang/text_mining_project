hotel staff is not properly trained we had to remind about a safe to be unlocked after being promised that it would be done right away but waiting in vain the same story happened when we asked for a bottle opener they just keep forgetting about guests requests another annoying factor was that our room was too hot and we were not able to bring the temperature down with air conditioning whilst windows could not be opened because of heat and stuffiness we were not able to sleep well
