very unpleasant approach of some staff twice i asked for an early breakfast for the next day but in the morning it turned out that our demand had been ignored the staff informed us about that adding that they cannot do anything it took me minutes to explain them and it was not due to language deficiencies that they should provide us with a discount for the missing breakfast or prepare a breakfast to go they also refused to contact the manager finally they provided two boxes of very poor breakfast it all took minutes at the end we did not even hear we are sorry and they did not even pretend that they bother well if this is an approach of hotel then i would suggest to book a hotel they tend to care more about their customers
