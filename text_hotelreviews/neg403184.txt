the glam hotel in milan is a nightmare we booked the hotel on their website which at that time said oops our staff is busy please try again we tried twice with the same result and then went on booking on booking com what happened was that the hotel charged us three times i spent two days on the phone and i had to talk three times to the it company used by the hotel sic which acknowledged that the problem on the website was theirs and it was only then that the hotel admitted that there was a problem no excuses from the hotel still we are now waiting for the credit card bill to see if they finally deleted the web reservations the hotel room itself was small but ok the breakfast and dinners were overcrowded and the staff did not manage to keep food on the buffet table so that everyone could get at least something the hotel has a garage but it was full and they gave us a discount ticket to a near by garage there one needs to leave the car and the keys and they don t even give you a receipt where it would mention the make or number plates we refused and after a long negotiation left the car but kept the key we definitely do not recommend this hotel
