i had a very unprofessional and rude experience at dinner a lady restaurant worker cleaned out my table and offered it to someone else while i was serving myself dessert the new guests were preparing to sit on the table when i returned with my dessert and told her i wasn t finished yet she just said it s okay and left after clearing the table i was speechless for a few minutes at the response the guests understood the awkward situation and moved to another table and i finished my dessert without a towel cutlery and in extreme embarrassement please train your staff to respond better to guests and hey dinner is not included in the room price if you re going to charge for water yes it doesn t cost much at all but this is not about the price it is about the principle my other two stays at this hotel have been good but you know the law of averages always catches up
