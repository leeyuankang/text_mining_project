the hotel had requested us to book two rooms to accommodate our family and we had done so and prepaid however we were asked the very same questions at the reception when we checked in and needed to go through all the cumbersome processes we had already done complete lack of communication and coordination among the hotel staff the reception was allogant and did not even apologize for their repeating of the same questions and processes we smelled a strong sewer like odor when we entered the room and asked the reception whether we can change the room a hotel staff checked the room and awknowldged the order however the hotel asked us to stay in the room overnight as no other rooms were available my wife and kids suffered from the very uncomfortable odor in the room without any compensation all in all truly a waste of money very uncomfortable check in and stay although the hotel is just in front of the milan main station its cost benefit ratio is just too high
