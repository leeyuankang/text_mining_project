the overall look feel of the hotel especially common areas entrance hallways corridors etc is slightly off it feels sometimes like a hours motel rather than a glamorous or hip hotel the floor carpet in the rooms has a terrible look looks a bit dirty and really un smooth to the naked feet my suggestion is to change it as soon as possible
