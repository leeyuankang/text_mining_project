breakfast area too narrow and crowded difficult to get around the buffet the bathroom has an awfully dangerous access to the bath whoever designed it wasn t thinking of using it but it could be very easy to have an accident getting in or out of the bath also as it happens too often in hotels these days the bath screen doesn t cover completely and it s impossible not to make a mess and flood the bathroom while having a shower
