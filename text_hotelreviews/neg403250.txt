my only complaint is that the hallways are dimly lite and the lack of no patio chairs on the balcony other then that it was a good hotel better then average and the staff was very polite and helpful the location is fantastic if you want to be in close proximity to the central milan train station it is directly across the street although i must worn women traveling alone or with just girls to be extremely careful this particular area in the evening becomes sketchy and handfuls of homeless people huddle around every corner when i was walking from the mcdonalds mccafe to the hotel directly across the street at around an extremely intoxicated homeless man became very belligerent when i told him i didn t have any money he stumbled behind me until i crossed the street obviously it was an uneasy feeling being a female alone at night but nothing became of it thank goodness another drawback for me was the cleanliness of the area for whatever reason this area has drawn many artist thugs however you choose to view it to spray paint graffiti on every building wall sidewalk etc some consider it art but this particular area looks vandalized and local officials have lost the battle to stop it it s truly shameful to see gang graffiti on historical buildings in my personal opinion i view it as disrespectful and a criminal act some locals told me they didn t mind the graffiti because it made their town feel lived in and not sterile like cannes or lugano therefore to each it own overall a well run hotel with a fantastic staff
