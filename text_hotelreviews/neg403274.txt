the room was modern but small dominated by a kingsize bed which is not neccessary really no lights for the writing table bathroom too exposed to the bedroom with no privacy door also bright lights from the basin mirror made it difficult for one partner to sleep while the other uses the bathroom no rails or hooks for the towels there were located in the toilet instead it will be nice if the basics are attended to first before the glam that this hotel claims
