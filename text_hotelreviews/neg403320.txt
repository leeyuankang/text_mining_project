many parts of the room were dusty or not fully clean these included the upper bar of the closet extremely dusty and the countertop of the bathroom sink apparently there were some small pieces of paper on it also i felt like the air from the air con fan was polluted breakfast didn t include a real espresso or cappuccino made through a professional machine only through a self service one finally the complimentary dinner which was included in the price of the room was no more than a self service gathering of uninspiring food in fact as soon as i walked in i decided to leave to a real restaurant outside the hotel
