the dinning room is very crowded and confusing even though the staff is excellent they are young and very helpful when you do the check in ask not to be given the rooms that have a tub the tub is absolutely very uncomfortable and dangerous the superior rooms have a very uncomfortable layout the shower is in front of the bed separated by a glass the normal rooms are much better we have been there several times and have been in all types of rooms
