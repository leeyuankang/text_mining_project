location had its pros and cons it s conveniently located a minutes walk from the milano centrale and the metro entrance is right besides the hotel building the only downside seems to be that it s located near a rather shabby neighborhood i had two incidents two nights in a row one involving a confrontation with a drunk homeless guy trying to pick a fight while i was minding my own business taking photos and the second involved being approached by a man trying to offer female services again while i was minding my own business trying to enjoy a nice cup of cappuccino at the restaurant in front of the hotel bar these incidents which the staff claimed were a rare occurrence the location and overall experience was great it isn t the hotel s fault that i experienced these issues which i kept trying to explain to the apologetic staff
