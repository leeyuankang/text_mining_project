we had a half board booked with breakfast and dinner we ate dinner once and were absolutely disgusted not clean at all we went to go get dessert and left our coke drink on the table came back and found that the table was cleaned and our drink was taken when we asked where is we were not done the reply was very rude and no apology just a sit sit gesture also we asked to get our drink he brought it back half empty with two used glasses we asked him if this was ours he was like i dont know this really got me angry cause for all we know we could be drinking a coke that another table left over and random glasses picked up from the to be washed sink he then gave us another drink but accused us that we had already finised our drink extremely rude and not polite also the lady in charge of the resturant was picking up fries that were tossed aside on the buffet table with her bare hands and putting it back part of the buffet which i found extremely non hygienic overall disgusting and do not recommend taking the any meals in glam milano
