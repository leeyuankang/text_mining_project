staff blamed customer on the problem of the hotel itself poor management on emergent case they made us feel like we are not paying guests but prisoners that they could provide whatever service they want i m talking about the supply of electricity in century i tried to think of something nice to say but i was furious during my stay all the sockets in my checked room had no power when we were back at round three staff came up and no one could fixed it we waited for more than an hour and requested to change a room but were told they were fully booked we tried to explain the importance of electricity can t believe this needs to be explained and they finally reluctantly brought us to a new room i was not mad before when the sockets found out to be nonfunctional but it was at that time i realized they had an attitude problem when they kept complaining that they didn t have an electrician to fix this at late hours so they don t want to solve this problem i felt like i have to push hard to ask them to provide a regular room the reason why they didn t do it in the first place was that the new room was an family suite one queen bed in a separate room and two single beds stuffed in the small entrance after mins in the new room there happened a black out in our room we called to ask someone to check the room the receptionist said that he couldn t listen well and request us to go downstairs when i told him there were no electricity at all in my room he even blamed this problem to my laptop and my cell phone seriously considering his attitude i understand i can t rely on him to solve the issue so i requested a new room card to try again the next day i found out that it was because of the electricity card slot was installed the way that the card has to be inserted horizontally therefore the card will slip out if you didn t push it too hard into the wall due to gravity
