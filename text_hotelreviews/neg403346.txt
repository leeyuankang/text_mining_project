i arrived and the place is chaos tons of families people running everywhere and slow elevators that took for ever then key card didn t work to get in room twice the hotel had some electrical or computer problem and none of the new rooms were working took over minutes to get in my room and i had no idea when i would while i was waiting i demanded my money back but because i paid on booking they said it was impossible facilities are far from glam basically furnished with cheap ikea like furniture one power outlet in the room breakfast was very mediocre business travelers should stay next door at best western atlantic not glam but easy and comfortable enough
