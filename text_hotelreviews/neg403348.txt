my key card stopped working and i was locked out of my room twice it was all resolved within minutes each time but it was annoying especially on the second occasion when i was due to leave within a short space of time also there was big problem with the water when i was there on the first night i couldn t have a shower at all when i rang reception i was told that an engineer was going to sort it but the problem was still there all of the next day with a lot of rattling in the pipes i understand that this happens but the communication of the problem and when it might be fixed could have been communicated better even with a note underneath the door to guests
