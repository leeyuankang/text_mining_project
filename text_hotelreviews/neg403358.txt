there was no water for two nights for the upper floor not even for washing your hands and brushing your teeth we have to go down on first floor if we want to take shower or going to toilet the room is a bit hot and very small we booked a superior room but they gave us standard room then we have to keep on asking them to change our room to the one we paid very bad service what a shame its a new hotel they even want to charge us for late check out after all the hassle we have same breakfast everyday its a ripped off not worth it
