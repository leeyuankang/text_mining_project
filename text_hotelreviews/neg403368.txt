we had dinner and breakfast included in our room rate both were ok but no better than that at dinner no member of staff offered us a drink and there wasn t even any water included a soft drink was while the suite we had was lovely some things were a little impractical like no shelf in the bathroom to put your toiletries minor but annoying there isn t much going on in the local area
