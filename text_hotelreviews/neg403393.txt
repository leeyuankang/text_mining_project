junior suites were dingy staff very rude food was included but cold absolutely horrible and to make matters worse they claim to charge fine you if you leave your food uneaten well we couldn t eat garbage and challenged them to fine us it was just myself and wife and paid for a junior suite but were forced to pay extra euros for our year old daughter we had clearly indicated during reservation that we were a family of adults and one child and prepaid our booking as billed we paid because we arrived late and had no where else to go this is in my opinion the worst hotel in europe and most certainly our worst hotel experience
