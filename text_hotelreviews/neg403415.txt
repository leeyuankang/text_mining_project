stayed here for nearly a month this hotel offers half board but the food is not that good i end up having dinner outside everyday the housekeeping is not very satisfactory room is not very clean even after housekeeping and i have to call every single morning to request for laundry bag and the form to fill in although they should put a new one everyday since i always send my clothes for laundry the worst thing is the kitchen staff threw my things and frozen food which we have agreed to put in the kitchen freezer during my stay i even put my name and room number on the packaging and i brought all the frozen foods all the way from my country for the fasting month my family has prepared and gone through the hassle to pack all those things for my long term stay working in milan kitchen hotel staff can t just threw away guest stuffs as they wish this is very upsetting and unacceptable i check out the next days and now am staying in a much better place for the next few months now that i think about it i should have asked for compensation
