i check in for nights from may to may room no and on may when i returned room i found a bottle water putting on the table and i didn t know why they put the water i ask my colleague if he got a bottle water or not so i checked the refrigerator again and found that the bottle water inside is opened and drank a half it s weird if that s not i drank it then who will be so i tell the reception and they send someone to check and also they didn t know why maybe next time when i check in for the first night i should double check the refrigerator and took a picture to make sure that i didn t drink or eat anything in the mini bar
