we came back to our room late one day and found the door unlocked and visibly not properly closed this is the first time this has ever happened to me in all my years of holidaying and business travel and is completely unacceptable on complaining to the reception who were apologetic we were offered a drink at the bar as by means of an apology which we were then charged for when we checked out another annoyance was the amount of beggars outside the hotel who were annoying my partner outside for a smoke in full view of the hotel security staff they did nothing to intervene very unhappy with our experience here
