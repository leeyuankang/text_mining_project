they gave us a very bad room the first night which was unlivable bedside light did not work as well as the safe the bathroom was terrible they changed the room to a better one the next day which was good as otherwise we would have left the hotel still there is a major problem with the lights which are very poor throughout i had to use my iphone flashlight to read in bed which was pretty ridiculous the prices of drinks at dinner are not included and are very high the charge euros for a small bottle of water
