water leaking to the room when taking shower the bathroom of standard double room black tile with bathtub was a nightmare first the bathtub is too high for petite people then the wet and dry separation didn t worked at all the glass door seal of the tub is aging which would let water leak to the floor and there s no floor drain so the water kept leaking to our room and finally soaked the carpet we stayed for just two nights so we didn t ask for changing a room i just can t understand why does a great star hotel make such a stupid design like this
