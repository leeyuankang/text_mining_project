brochure inside our room said that breakfast is supposed to start at during weekdays one day we had an early morning train to catch so we came down to eat at and the staff was still putting out the food we ended up leaving at and half the food was still not out in the dining area also the breakfast dinner area has these stylish red lights above the tables which are made out of metal and are so easy to hit with your head when you get up from the table seen it happen twice so maybe a suggestion would be to raise these lights up a bit so the people don t hit their heads
