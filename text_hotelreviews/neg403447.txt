for a four star hotel l would expect things such as the complimentary hot drinks in our room to be replenished daily not the case although our room was serviced daily not once did we receive replacement coffee tea we never received any milk to go with the single sachet of coffee we did use i would have to add that in such a highly rated hotel l was disappointed our food was not hot on any occasion lukewarm would best describe the state of the food at each of our meals and on one occasion i returned a beef burger as it was not fully cooked minced beef should be thoroughly cooked in order to kill off any nasties which could cause an upset or worse tummy the meal was replaced but no apology offered nor any sign of a concerned chef i reiterate food service standards in my experience of such highly rated hotels is a visible transparent process carried out by the establishment chef or their deputy not so here i am afraid hence the reason i cannot give the glam a five star rating sorry
