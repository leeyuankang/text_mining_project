breakfast on my day was quite chaotic and the room too full and there was no normal bread of the sinks in the bathroom was broke in my room and not fixed either during my stay water would stay in it the other thing is the online check in great idea but you still have to wait in line for all other guests to finish their check in so now it did not offer a real advantage
