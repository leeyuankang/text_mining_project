the breakfast is horrible the food is not good quality and it doesn t taste good the breakfast room is too small for the number of guests and we were there in low season very bad managed the staff had no idea of what they were doing and not because they were bad it is because there are too many people in a tiny narrow room there s always something missing and they take a while to refill i was standing in a corner for a good waiting for someone to bring extra spoons and cheese the coffee is horrible and comes from a machine i flew with easyjet and trust me the coffee in easyjet is better than the one in this hotel the coffee cups are very small not regular size if you like to drink coffee you better be ready to get in the queue patiently don t pay for half board you re in italy and this hotel location is great you can find so many different places to eat and with better food quality we only used our half board once because it was just horrible and it was the same disaster of the breakfast same room same problems and they overcharged in the prices of the drinks because they are not included this hotel is great if you just want to sleep in a clean tidy place and catch an early train to the airport otherwise forget about the breakfast and half board included it is a con and go find somewhere else plenty of options they forgot it was my birthday they didn t put a cake and a bottle of wine in our room like they said they would horrible service my wife tried to call twice the reception room nobody answers
