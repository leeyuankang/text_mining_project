no ironing facilities in the room you have to use the laundry service this was quite inconvienient due to the timings and cost of this service also the rooms tea and coffee kits were not replenished during my entire night stay even though the room was cleaned everyday i had to ask for more on the final night which was brought up straightaway but i was only given two decaff coffee sachets i thought this was poor service the restuaruant even though there seemed to be two large dining rooms these weren t in use instead a smaller room was used with a buffet at one end and limited seating then tables extended into the corridor right infront of the lifts that people use to enter the resturuant i thought that was quite bizzare really i get that maybe it is out of season so the rooms weren t used but sitting next to a lift door opening were confused dinners are getting out wondering were to go was quite off putting waiters should really be greeting guests and seating them instead it is very hard to know if you should find your own seat or wait to be seated this isn t really communicated
