i didn t like dinner at all and restaurant there dinner was included but food wasn t tasty and enough sometimes the plates even were empty and you had to wait when at list anything will appear at sweden table the staff at restaurant worked like you are not there or not important they spoke loud about their own interest and could tell you not to sit at some tables and wait when they will clean another
