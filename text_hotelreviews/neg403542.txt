i like the modern set up of the bathroom however the bathtub shower may be a little difficult to get into if you have some mobility issues as it would be helpful if there was a step also the setup of the shower door does not work very well because if you take a shower and use the overhead showerhead the bathroom floor will likely be full of water also the hotel is missing a business as well as a fitness centre however if you need documents printed the staff at the front desk is more than willing to accommodate your needs
