we were a couple years child and we had booked a double room for nights considering that beds are large and our child could sleep with us or in a separate bed which we could order at site upon checkin we were told that we have to upgrade for a triple room coz the child is and hotel policy etc and we were glad with that and we paid the upgrade without any problem however the room wasn t really triple because the bed couldn t accommodate an adult or lets say the bed was ok for to stars hotel but to stars and i don t know why the toilet had shower towels and small towels the day we checked in but they removed the set of towels after the morning so the hotel charged us for persons adults years child but didn t think it was important to put a set of towels for the person i also don t know why they didn t replace any of the toiletries during our entire stay shampoo conditioner shower gel soap and lotion there was of each when we arrived and they used to clean the room when we re gone without replacing any of the above one other important issue is that it takes around to of leaving the water running to get hot water which was annoying finally the breakfast room is too small to accommodate the hotel guests i mean i don t think the hotel was fully booked and yet it was pretty hard to find a table for breakfast without waiting don t get me wrong the hotel is good and someone has done a good job in putting this package together but somehow they are missing out on few little things which would make big differences for the guests
