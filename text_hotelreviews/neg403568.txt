we spent two nights in the hotel although we were two persons in the room there was only one pair of sleepers there was never added an other one the same happened when we used the bathroom cosmetics never replaced the used items breakfast not functional at all too long distance between the buffet and the last tables should be two points also because in the rush time there are so many people and so little space i can t say that we didn t enjoy our staying but definitely i can t tell that was extraordinary pay more attention to details
