hotel ran out of shower towels on the second night but did manage to find us some after a while it was impossible to take a shower without flooding the whole bathroom although the rain shower was nice since there was no curtain or other partition bathroom was fairly cold towel rack didn t heat up although i assume it was supposed to there were no hooks for towels or clothes or shelves in the bathroom for toiletries mattresses a bit too firm but that s a matter of taste of course
