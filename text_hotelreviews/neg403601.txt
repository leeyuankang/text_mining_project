only problem is the structure of the bath shower area it is very tall im m and wide to get over to the bathtub for shower and when taking a fantastic rainshower the water seep through the splash glass panel into the dry area have to lay a towel over the water puddle after use hope the management will do some rectification to avoid possible slippage
