the breakfast service had many staff but lacked direction or systems or both the happy hour was ridiculous as the price of a bottle of wine went from to minimum price and the beer selection in the terrace is wrong why not have the same beers as down in the bar i could not drink my second beer as it was undrinkable and i am in the wine and food business in australia but i still paid for all the drinks
