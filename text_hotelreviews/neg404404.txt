i had to extend the trip for days i went downstairs to do it in person the lady said it would cost euro extra per night after check the availability i got onto the hotels website and saw the price was euro cheaper than the price the lady gave me when i showed her she apologized and changed the price but it didn t look like a mistake she got caught trying to get extra money from an unsuspecting customer probably a last time customer due to this
