cold shower and very poor breakfast the hotel is beautiful and modern staff are very polite and helpful but this hotel disappointed us after a long day when we tired to have a hot bath the water did not get hot it only got warm so i tried the shower room and after min water got cold and i was shivering called the reception and they send an engineer who after min told us this is as much as it gets hot and trust me it was only just warm i didn t go back to the shower even washed my face with cold water in the morning breakfast was another big disappointment for a hotel like this with this level of eye blinding fasciitis you expect a good breakfast it was awful very limited choice of cheese butter and bread and for hot breakfast they served cold sausages cold chewy bacon and cold mushrooms we had to order the eggs and my scrambled eggs were a disaster so over cooked that i couldn t eat it and omelette was very average
