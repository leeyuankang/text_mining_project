two elevators very slow just had the worst luck pressing down they go up etc next day one of two is out of service so took the stairs other issue was restaurant which was completely booked out by an external group i could not eat dinner at the hotel other than room service or the sleepy downstairs bar finally concierge was able to help one person on staff waited in line for minutes to get advice doormen had no idea for the price of the hotel this part was really quite poor
