now the bad part which really upset me after a long day at the milano expo i wanted to come back to hotel chill in hottub and go back to room and relax we arrived back to hotel and the cleaners had not been to room i would a liked fresh sheets on the bed and after a long day you dont want to come back to a mess so after finally cleaning room ourselves we go to spa apparently we needed to book the hottub well that was no good we where leaving early the following day to catch a flight also swimming pool wasnt ready yet but that wasnt hotels fault we where told that on arrival the hotel was amazing shame those small things let it down but id still go back staff and other things the hotel had to offer was unreal oh and no iron in room and they charge crazy prices for ironing your clothes thought it should a been free considering they had no iron in room but still
