i did not like the service of the reception in any way i was attended by of the receptionists and they were truly unprofessional to say the least i booked two rooms one room for people for nights and room for one person for night we were sent to the rooms in an inverted way the single person got a big room and the two others were in a really small room on the following day we checked out from the small room and said that we wanted to keep the bigger room since two people would remain in the hotel for two more nights the receptionist said she could not allow that because that room was already booked to what i had to question because when i booked two rooms i asked them to be close to each other or at least on the same floor i was given rooms in different floors and the explanation was that the hotel guarantees a room for my booking but it cannot guarantee a specific one well it seem that for some guests they can do so i did keep the big room but i will never stay in this hotel again it is not worth it to be on vacation and having to argue with people who should be willing to treat you right
