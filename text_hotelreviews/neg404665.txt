you can pay slightly more and get a much better hotel plain and old design which is quite surprising given it s in the heart of milano entering the hotel is like entering a military base i had a friend with me who wanted to come up to the room for a few minutes so i can drop my luggage the lady insisted that he has to leave his id at the reception and pick it up on his way out shower was not working properly do not disturb button was not working no price menu for the minibar
