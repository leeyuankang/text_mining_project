for the price i would not stay again the location is the main thing going for it we had a triple room which on arrival were told we d been upgraded i dread to think of what the original room was as the third bed was a sofa bed at per night a bed was expected no iron in the room and when we rang to get one we were told we could have it for or pay for delayed return only one bathrobe provided but two more were supplied when requested bathroom supplies not replenished as used upon departure there was no questions asked about our stay or feedback all in all it s a hotel charging far too much for what it actually provides location is its main advantage
