the initial room allocated was completely unacceptable even though part of a new extension it was very dark looked out over concrete as on floor and needed a map to negotiate the endless twisting narrow corridor and consequently a long trek to the lift wonderful bathroom but its size was at expense of the bedroom we asked for a change but told we had to wait until next day so we did not unpack the receptionist made notes on our requirements next morning we found that no notes had been left for staff so we started all over again we chose a room on floor with light and were told it would be ready by we checked in at only to find the room was not made up the receptionist told us she had rescheduled the cleaning for pm but didn t inform us we took occupancy at pm no apologies along this journey after that things looked up and it was a nice room except the safe deposit box didn t work and our things were locked in for hours and it was an engineering issue not just another client code problem we had stayed at the hotel before which the hotel knew and had been given a very nice room so the original room allocated on this visit was an even bigger disappointment despite the many good points about this hotel we will not go back too risky and too much effort to correct the problem
