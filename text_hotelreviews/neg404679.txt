i am thananchai limpiphipatanakorn a starhotel royal customer and a victim from the act and crime that happened on april in the rosa grand starhotel i and my family visited the hotel on april for the lighting and furniture fair in milan which is organized every years and we always choose your hotel as our first choice because i expected that the rosa grand star hotel should be able to provide us both comfortable and safety with the best hospitality unfortunately my decision was wrong there was not comfortable it was the poorest hospitality that i even had in my experiences and the worst is very insecure since first day of my visit the hotel guest service at the counter was impolite and not helpful we booked two rooms close to each other because of my father health and disability the front desk told us that if we would like to get two rooms on the same floor we have to pay additional euro per night and that was totally fine for us however it was so early to check in at that time so they told us to be back later once we were back the front desk told us that there were not two rooms available on the same floor and it might be misunderstanding after a long discussion finally we got the room on the floor room and the rooms that were under graded than our booking but it was fine for me at least we can stay in the same floor and i was very tried already at our second day there was glass broken by accident in my mother s room and i called the hotel receptionist to help me to get house keeper to clean the broken glasses i was waiting in the room for the housekeeper for a long time because i was afraid the housekeeper might step on the broken glasses without notice it and she might get hurt i waited and waited but no one shown up so i decided to go down to the front desk i was in a queue for a long time until my turn instead of taking care of me as the turn the front desk mr
