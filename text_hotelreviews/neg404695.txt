alcohol prices the bar is chic and very large but it s expensive for a small glass of larger and i mean smaller than the half pint glasses served in uk and ireland for a small glass of wine and for a vodka and red bull we still managed to have a great time but we really think milan as a rule is very expensive for absolutely no reason at all we have travelled loads of cities in italy and europe and milan is far more expensive and not near a patch on rome verona venice apart from the famous cathedral and swanky shops there s not much else to see or do in milan
