the normal rooms are really bad the lights are falling the furniture is bad so i had to upgrade my room to a superior room the price for the rooms is too expensive comparing to hotels in uae and the room is too small and they gave people in front of me an executive room for a superior room price and for me i had to pay the whole price the only thing i liked is the location of the hotel and the cleanliness and security and the staff
