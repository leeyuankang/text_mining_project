we had a very bad experience during check out that am surprised about during check in we as group we ensured to pay all the cost and tax related to our room and in additional euros as insurance and if there will be additional services when we went to do the check out we were shocked that the reception staff start with that there is tourist tax and a bill of ironing and laundry service that you need to pay and as we confirmed that we already paid the related tax in check in and no laundry dry clean have been done and we only called the receptionists them self over three days to send to us the iron to our room and at that time they told us in the three days that as they don t have the irons in the rooms that do this as complimentary service and they do it within hours for two pieces for a customer during the full stay we did not receive a bill that contain charges neither that they requested our signatures once receiving the clothes the staff was so rude and what surprised me most that he said that he do not need our approval and he can charge this on our credit card this is totally not acceptable hotels staff should be clearly responsible and they are accountable of granting customer approval for charging things on customers cards it is totally not acceptable that they do not know their boundaries first of how to communicate to customers and the second their accountability regarding customers cards etc at that time we asked the staff to call the manager and he said he cannot another receptionist joined and started saying that they have bills and we asked them to bring them the first receptionist came back with some bills that all of them has no signatures and he shocked me with a bill dated nov the day we are doing the check out at i clearly told him i need a photo of this bill and how while we are now at am there is a bill claimed in this day
