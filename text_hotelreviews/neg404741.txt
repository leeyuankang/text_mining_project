worst staff ever unfortunatly they have changed the staff of the welcoming reception with inexperienced extremely rude pretentious stupid persons especially the woman with a fringe on her forehead maybe all italians are kind friendly and hospitable but in this hotel they re quite the opposite the location is good on the other hand you really don t feel you re in europe mainly all women clients are wearing the tchador with all respect as if you were in saoudi arabia and absolutely not in italy furthermore the hotel has newly opened a hall of prayer i assume the hotel administration is very materialistic they would do anything to gain one more penny i would really advise to stay away from this hotel
