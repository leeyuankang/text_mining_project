i have ordered continental breakfast it comes with cereal coffee or tea orange juice a fruit platter and a selection of breads with jam honey and nutella i only got the bread and the juice i paid euros for bread and juice i m very disappointed and will never go back they always deliver short and they don t provide irons for the room for safety reasons but if you want your shirt to be ironed they ll charge you for it what a scam
