the room that we were given booked through booking com was at the very end of a long and winding hall way though inside of the room is nice the spot itself is not the cheapest room though not that cheap in addition every time the guest s next door closed the door there s a big sound of bang and our room wall would tremble it s bad enough during the day but worse at nights the sound always woke us up several times during the night in the middle of our sleep was it the door was it the location was it the people next door always bang their door who knows
