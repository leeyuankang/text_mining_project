unfortunately it was let down by the basic rooms which did not reflect the entrence or decor of the hotel at reception it was very disappointing to see old wood furniture and decor the worst shower i have ever been in it actually had no shower tray or secure way to secure the water from the shower only curtains to the floor the water ran into the rest of the bathroom very few people eat in the restaurant in the evening as i only say one or two twice i asked for a dish on the menus and was told it was not available i ate there for nights i apparently i could not even order a pitzza in the restaurant i could only order this from the room figure that one out try ordering a coffee for breakfast it takes forever and cold service over all was very inattentive and poor it felt like they were doing you a favor and length of time it took to to order a coffee or ask for a bill was just crazy they had a chanel customer service academy training course in the hotel they should take some lessons from them
