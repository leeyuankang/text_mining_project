internet is slow even the one on payment i have seen faster connections elsewhere where it was also free on a hotel of this caliber maybe the high speed connection should be faster and free and if not free much faster the fidelity program is a little complicated points can be accumulated only if one reserves from the membership site there are companies just like mine where hotel reservation is centralized therefore is not done individually the company obviously does not use the membership site so whatever can be accumulated is lost maybe it would be kinder if the hotel accumulates points like all the other hotels upon presentation of a membership card after the settlement of the bill
