i always go to this hotel once or twice a year but this time was awful the ac wasn t working in the room we died of heat and couldn t sleep well which is what ruined my whole trip then the concierge was awful he didn t have the patience to look for and book for just one restaurant ultimately he sent us without booking to the worst italian restaurant finally i had pre booked and pre paid for myself and my fiance in the room so adults but the first night as we came back to the hotel the receptionist wanted to charge us for the extra adult thinking i was bringing some kind of girl back to my hotel room he then checked my booking and confirmed my point it was humiliating i am definitely not going back to this hotel after years of being their loyal customer it is a shame their quality went down drastically
