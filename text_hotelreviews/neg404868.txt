bad service for a hotel of this category the only contact with the hotel personnel which is really pleasant is the one in the reception rather than this the people that answer the phone and take care of room service are beyond rude i did not have a bottle opener in the room and needed to ask for it twice it finally arrived more than hour later when i was already sleeping also the personnel during breakfast do not speak english someone from the hotel took my room key from the table while i was serving myself the buffet once they found it they would return it to me but fail even to apology while offering a large buffet breakfast was poor in taste with scrambled eggs tasting sweet
