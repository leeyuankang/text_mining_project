the bath in the room was broken the staff gave us the option to stay or move rooms when we chose tom move we found the room was smaller and a bit of a downgrade overlooking the air conditioning we didn t say anything more as the move had taken an hour and we were already late for dinner but it seemed like the hotel was unwilling to provide any further compromise additionally it doesn t have the facilities or service you would expect of a hotel and we were assured that there is only a view if you book a suit otherwise if you book a standard room you overlook the back of the hotel
