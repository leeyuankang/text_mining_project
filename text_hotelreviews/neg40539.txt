i specifically paid more to get a room with a terrace and a view which was great when we arrived to the hotel however the rooms with view are in the in the attic and it was extremely warm in the room at night we could not sleep and called the front desk since clearly the ac was not working a first gentlman came up and i showed him the thermostat in the room showing degrees frt and he said just close windows and wait it out a couple hours and it will be cool hours later i called somebody again since thermostats had not moved he came up and said that room does not have ac yet and it only kicks in later in the year as it was unusual to have these temps in paris he called down and told them we can not leave them here and we were moved to a room without a terrace but with ac so the first person lied and did not try to move us my daughter who is could not sleep and they saw how sweaty she was a couple of days later it was raining i grabbed a hotel umbrella sitting next to the door and the concierge came out running as he was mumbling to his collegue in french apperantly unhappy and grabbed it out of my hand saying i could not use that umbrella little that he knew we are french native speakers i expkained to him and manager that was unacceptable and he could have used his words and not his hands he sent us an apilogy letter and macaroons to the room later but i will never go back to this hotel we are frequent travelers to france all to star hotels and this is the first time at this one terrible experience and nobody suggested not charging us for the view we paid for but never got because of ac issues i never write a bad review and have always been pleased with my hotels but the staff here is terrible and the service and lies are unacceptable for a star hotel
