the breakfast was the same every day during our stay and there were no vegetables at all the kitchen had a long table everyone sits at the same table if you love private space i don t recommend the breakfast at this hotel for you second day at the breakfast they ran out of bread there was a small bottle of red wine on the table in the room when we have arrived we have expected that this is a welcome drink at the checkout we had to pay euro for that wine because it was part of the mini bar even if it was not in the mini bar but on the table the wine itself was quite poor so i recommend you not to drink it the hotel has a metro station within but that line doesn t take you to the main attractions of milan you have to change the line at garibaldi zara if you prefer to walk be prepared for a walk to the cathedral the tourist tax is a bit expensive euro day person we had to pay this extra at the checkout
