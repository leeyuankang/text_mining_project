the whole experience was disappointing we stayed at the hotel for nights the staff was kind but a little bit untrained the hotel did not recreate a home like atmosphere the lounge was beautifully decorated but the whole place looked shabby especially the rooms which looked so dated that made you feel they were not clean the rooms were not sound proofed so you could hear disturbing noises from the other rooms the breakfast experience was not pleasant at all the cutlery was dirty the table runners had stains from previous guests of the same morning which means that nobody from the stuff checked if the runners were clean after the first guests had left the breakfast table the refilled bottles of water on the table looked again shabby and didn t give you the essence they were clean we didn t want to have breakfast the next morning this hotel was definitely not worth euro per night
