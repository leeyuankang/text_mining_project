the barman was not polite at all when i asked for two glasses made from glass the room is equiped with plastic glasses the room was very small half of meter on every bed edge even if it was an superior room and the view from the window was too ugly to be watched we stayed nights and in one morning after breakfast i was food poisoned most probably from the meat there are no espresso and capucino available at breakfast unless you ask from waiters and they are not happy when asked and they don t even struggle to fake it
