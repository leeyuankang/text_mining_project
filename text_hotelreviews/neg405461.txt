the staff is rude they could not get money from my credit card while i was checking out and rudely told me that there is something wrong with my card i talked to my bank there was nothing wrong it was clear that there was something wrong with their connection but they rudely insisted i kindly asked them to call their pos help center they did not just did nothing to solve the problem so i went to the nearest atm and get some cash to pay using the same card then while i was waiting in the lobby for my taxi i happened to hear that they were doing the same to another customer so i intervened and told the customer that there is nothing wrong with their card but they sent him to the atm as well and the staff did not even care to apologize they might be doing this because they needed cash right away i do not know the hotel itself is definitely not star in the uk us standards star it is beds are like wooden hard pillows are high the shower handle is fixed and half of the water goes outside wifi keeps disconnecting and very slow staff throwing garbage at making noises no chair in the room to sit on the desk just an ottoman no toothpaste old shower curtain with stains on it no tv channels in english apart from a couple of news channels like cnn and bbc smelly towels etc
