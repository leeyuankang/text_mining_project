we chose this hotel as a way to splash out in milan but we were left a bit disappointed the room was incredibly small for the price we were paying there was no bath either especially for what was meant to be a star we got the booking at half price inc city tax for two nights and even then if we considered the full price there is no way we d spend it here it just didn t feel like a star at all no one offered to carry our bag to our room when we arrived we weren t offered a map until we asked or offered any tips no lowdown on the hotel like an info booklet in the room apart from a free magazine either these things aren t huge but for a star you d expect a certain level of class
