they advertise air conditioner on they facilities and we had an air conditioner in our room but they turn it off and make up every possible excuse to not turn it on we came back one afternoon from a very long walk and our room was extremely hot since the sun hits our window the whole day it was degrees that day but in the room it felt like so i called down to reception to ask why our air conditioner wasn t working and the lady told me that they have shut down the power because many gest were complaining that their rooms were too cold which i found it was weird since you could turn the air conditioner off from the rooms they have a remote so i explained to the receptionist that our room was too hot and she got super upset because they have turned of the power for the air conditioning in the whole hotel and she would have to turn it on just for us she yelled at me on the phone and hung up two minutes later the air conditioning was working but it went off half an hour later that was our firs day in milan and we stayed for three nights and the air conditioning never works despite me calling and asking for it they response was always it s on you just have to wait for it they claim to be a star hotel when it does not deserve even star
