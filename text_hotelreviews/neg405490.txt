adjoining rooms make sure you dont have a room with interconnecting doors all these adjoining rooms are very noisy you can hear your neighbors talking we had to change our room after night but night was even worse since people in upper floor arrived at a m and continued their party till i had to go to the reception but it did not help honestly i expected some better rooms if you are staying at star hotel in the downtown no vegetables for breakfast only fruit pastry and common meal
