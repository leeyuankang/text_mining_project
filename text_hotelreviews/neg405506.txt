the hotel tried to charge an extra on check out they tried to make us believe that was the price thankfully i took a copy of the reservation due to this we missed out malpensa express train to the airport we then had to wait another half an hour for the next train and just about made our flight probability best not to pay at the hotel and just to pay online at least that way there are no issues with price on check out
