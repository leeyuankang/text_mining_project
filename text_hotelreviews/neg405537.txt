we travelled in october and found the hotel to be very warm considering it was over outside and the the air conditioning was turned off so all you could do was open a window which meant being disturbed at nice whilst trying to sleep and also you could here people in other rooms when they flushed the toilet or emptied the sink although a nice hotel i would not stay here again because i didn t get much sleep
