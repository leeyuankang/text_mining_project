the room was very dark and cold the shutters were broken i asked to fix them and after days i was told that additional maintenance was needed and it was not possible to repair it the shutters were then pushed down leaving me completely in the dark with no view the food was running out very quickly and every morning i had to wait at least minutes to have food again
