i was given an old room type and the explanation was that these classic rooms were advertised at booking com with lower rates i knew that the hotel had renovated nicer rooms due to my previous stay at this hotel i called the reception and they were very kind to change my room it would be good to check this before booking with the hotel it s not very close to the center it takes some time by tram when there is some traffic note that there are lot of traffic lights and crossroads at milano ironing services are provided in to hours time i was offered the ironing set to my room shower handle was leaking water i think technical controls are weak very poor lighting in the bathroom
