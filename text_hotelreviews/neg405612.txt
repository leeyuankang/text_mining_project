i had a bad quarrel with one of the receptionist due to an invoice i needed and was issued on a wrong name the guy didn t want to listen what i need and what i expect and just repeating we have it that way and that s it also permitted himself to comment me in italian considering that i am not understanding it was absolutely unrespectful situtation and i think that a hotel that pretends to be can t afford to begave like this with its guests
