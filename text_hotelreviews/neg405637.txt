i ve experienced a very irresponsible incident on sunday night i have asked your reception whether i can park my car on the side street or not as there were very few cars which is quite unusual the answer was people might be away for the weekend and probably that is why there are few cars the next morning when i walked out i saw that the car was towed when i asked your morning shift receptionist about where the car could be his answer was there is a street market and that i should have not ced the sign i have told him that i have already asked the question and i was never informed about it despite the fact that i asked the night before the attitude and the way that i received the response should not be the way that a customer should be treated your receptionist told me that i should have known this as a visitor can not know this detail on top of all due to the car tow i lost half a day of my business meetings which also resulted with a financial loss
