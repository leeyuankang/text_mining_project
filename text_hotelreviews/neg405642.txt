arrived at the hotel after a very long plane flight over hours to find that all they had was a single room available and would not let my husband stay even if i agreed to pay more money this was fashion week so there were no hotels available we were not aware of the rules in italy not allowing for guest to stay in single rooms the hotel desk person was very rude and said there was nothing he could do and walked away the worst part was they would not refund my payment so i had to pay for nights and couldn t stay at the hotel spent another hours searching for a room and had to go minutes outside of town to find one
