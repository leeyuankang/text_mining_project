the fairly recently renovated shower leaked onto the bathroom floor making it slippery and unpleasant we advised the staff on the first morning who said it would get attended to but the next morning it was just the same we spoke with the manager on checkout and although he was sorry and reduced our room rate it is disappointing when these issues are not corrected when noticed all it needed was application of some sealant also the charge for an aperitivo on the roof was very excessive at euro each
