we found the majority of the staff here rather rude and indifferent for the most part it was like pulling teeth to try and get answers and directions for anything it always seemed like i was bothering them whenever i asked most of the staff anything alex on the rooftop bar was lovely and attentive though as was the one receptionist with long dark hair whose name i unfortunately didn t get she was helpful to all guests she interacted with breakfast was ok overall but nothing stood out the room never felt cool enough but was passable if you enjoy a really cold room to sleep in at night i would reconsider especially during these blazing summer months otherwise i will not come back and will not recommend the place to anyone
