room size was a little on the small side but overall ok why is it almost everywhere that when booking a double room there is only one luggage rack available obviously two people are staying in the room and both normally would have their own suitcase one usually ends up on the floor in this hotel i cleared the nightstand and used it as the other stand for my suitcase
