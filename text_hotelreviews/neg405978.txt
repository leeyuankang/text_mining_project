entire experience was a nightmare from start to finish and we were on our honeymoon upon check in we were informed we had to pay an additional per person per night because booking com did not transmit the info properly i can t hold that against the hotel but will address this with booking com after checking in we went to the roof for dinner very and every meal was just horrible my wife ordered the land and sea option but we were told it was just one or the other ok her carpaccio tasted like hamburger meat and hamburger seasoning my fish was cold and very fishy tasting definitely not worth the money for a crappy meal we then went over to the bar section and ordered a cocktail i got my martini but my wife waited for minutes and her drink never came we were never acknowledged by bar staff again to let them know so we finally just decided to leave when they saw us leaving displeased the bar staff finally asked who had taken our order so they could look into it but made no effort to buy us a drink or even apologize then we got back to the room and the toilet would not stop running and it was loud like a rushing river my wife called the front desk and i went down to talk to the manager i explained the entire awful evening to him and he was more interested in our terrible dinner than the toilet but said he would send someone up to the room to fix it the first bellhop that came up to fix it was able to get it to stop running as soon as he left the toilet would no longer flush so we called downstairs again while waiting for the next repair we got a knock at the door i opened it assuming it was the gentleman here to fix the toilet but instead it was the restaurant manager waving the dinner receipt in my face and asking why we didn t tell him we were dissatisfied while at the restaurant this is at at night down a dark hallway we were the only room down there
