we had travelled hrs and arrived at the hotel at would have been good if the staff was more accommodating and tried to get us a room as early as possible but they did not even try there would have been some guests that may have checked out early like we did at when we did wake it was pm and there were no room service or a meal anywhere in the vicinity
