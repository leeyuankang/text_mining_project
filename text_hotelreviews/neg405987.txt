the hotel was below our expectations first of all parking is very inconvenient the parking facility do not belong to the hotel they just forward you to some parking garage for a day hotel lobby looks new and stylish but one cannot claim the same for rooms room furnishings look old and ran down and size of the rooms are quite small also you can easily hear voices spoken in the next room which is a very negative thing
