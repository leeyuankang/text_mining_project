we booked the family room quadruple and arrived at pm to find that our room was not ready and we were asked to wait just a couple of minutes after minutes of standing in the lobby i kindly asked if the hotel might have a similar room that we could be re assigned one of the ladies at the desk started programming new keys for a new room but then another hotel rep started arguing loudly that this was not ok we were then told to wait a few more minutes we became a bit impatient since we had made reservations at another venue and because of the problems of our check in to this hotel were made to show up very late after a few more minutes we were told that our room was ready however when we got to our room we were met by at least three people desperately cleaning and were told to wait a few more minutes please see pic of cleaning crew still working on our room the ac was not functioning properly so our room was very hot the fan on the ac intake is also quite loud and does not have a on off switch
