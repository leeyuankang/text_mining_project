travelodge at times the price the hotel fairly centrally located had very little character no welcome made to feel a valued guest and amenities were basic on arrival the check in advised that she would upgrade the room as there was more space the upgraded room was smaller than a standard size uk room room service was basic sheets not changed floors not hoovered and dirty cups not removed and replaced with clean breakfast had a good assortment but on two mornings running left an unsettled feeling in the stomach the standard same reply to all reviews on this site gives away the lack of individual customer value and welcoming as shown in person walls between rooms were thin with full conversations heard and the noise from the trams on the road below at high floors was great the roof top bar sounded great but again there appeared to be apathy in customer care many tables littered with dirty glasses and a euro price tag for a basic non adventurous cocktail there are many more hotels at this price in milan that would be better
