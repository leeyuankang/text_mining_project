bathroom is absolutely ok but the bathtub shower is small unpractical and a bit uncomfortable tv screen is way below standard very very small only two elevators for many floors and rooms more than once i had to wait quite a bit for the elevator to come and i was on the floor so using the stairs was not super practical a bit pricey overall euros per night but it s worth for the location
