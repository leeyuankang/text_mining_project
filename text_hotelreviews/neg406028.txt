i didnt like the front desk manager he tries to be polite but he does not like to help at all also i did not like the bathrooms and the bathtubs that are extremely small although the size of the bathroom is acceptable also u did not like the bidet which is very difficult to use also the noise of the tram whichbis running all night is very annoying
