not all staff members treat guests the same from some of the staff being so kind welcoming and pleasant there are some not really kind or helpful two quite opposite experiences in communication with different staff about the same thing another minus for people who must leave early in the morning no avalable early breakfast or packed one but would definitely stay again at this hotel because it is a great value for money excellent location great food and all clean not to mention the fabulous rooftop terrace
