when we entered the room it seemed like we were entering into a freezer we tried to bring the temperature up with no luck then we tried to turn it off its noise was too loud anyway but there was no off button we asked for help and the cleaning lady told us we would have to call reception desk in order to have the ac turned off so we did and we were informed that the centralized heating was not yet turned on but nice touch they could bring us more blankets in case we needed needless to say it was not a comfortable night it was not comfortable to get off the shower in the morning into the freezin room shower that also spills water everywhere on the floor regarding breakfast it was ok this is a huge room full of guests with hardworking staff trying to keep up literally sweating but with plastic orange juice a no no for me regarding staff maybe it was just bad luck but at they are knocking at your door and in fact opening it just to check if they can clean the room can t they be informed by the reception desk who already checked out but also this lady at the reception desk that looks like a special agent from the eastern block was very professional getting the payment at check in and not check out like in any other place considering that as mission accomplished she turned to the next guest and only after a good deal of time staring at her she asked me in a very snobbish way is there anything else i can do for you sir in fact there is now that i have paid for it maybe you could hand me the room keys bottom line is an old hotel in need of some major refurbishments people and equipment wise in a very convenient spot
