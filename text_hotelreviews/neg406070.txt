there was no hot water in the bathroom on the last morning prior to a very early checkout the reception wasted time sending someone after minutes just to verify whether our complaint was true in any case they were unable to get the hot water running and finally offered the use of another bathroom floors below ours this was clearly unacceptable also despite the booking com commitment that there would be no deposit or advance the hotel tried charging blocking an amount on our credit card days before we checked in this led to all kinds of complications because we were already on tour in other parts of italy by then and our bank couldn t contact us to verify the transaction
