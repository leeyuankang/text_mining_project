when we reached we booked a smoking room facility but there was a lot of noise i think they were doing maintenance it was shock for us then we called and asked to stop it they said it will be stopped around and we checked it around so they changed the room for us but with no smoking facility which makes us go the roof or stand outside the hotel to smoke it doesn t bother us much since we were outside all the time
