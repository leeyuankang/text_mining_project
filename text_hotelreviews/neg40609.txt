hotel itself is nice and modern although a few things needs improvement such as the pillows and the layout bathroom door right next to the bed and no bathroom fan rooms are a bit small and the elevator is slow for a star at this price it s not the best value the biggest problem however was with one particular staff member charles the luggage porter while waiting to check in we left our bags with him in storage upon attempting to retrieve them we were told the luggage would be delivered to the room but it did not arrive we were told that charles was very busy so we just asked to take the bags ourselves staff refused to let us take our bags even though we clearly identified them the staff called charles who complained that we had interrupted his lunch and then he also refused to let us take our bags claiming it was his job to provide this service and that we had no choice to take the bags ourselves the luggage hostage situation continued until we basically had to issue an ultimatum charles responded by laughing and then walking off we have stayed in hotels all over the world and have never seen such a thing happen like this before it was more than poor training he clearly was treating us either differently or more poorly than he would other clients the other staff of the hotel including the manager were quite helpful and friendly
