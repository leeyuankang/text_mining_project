we were visiting milan as part of our honeymoon requested an early check in months before arriving received confirmation of this however on arrival at midday we were told our room was not ready we were placed in the only available room which was noisy next the the lift was small was not a standard and had a terrible smell from the drains in the bathroom as there were no other rooms available we could not swap fortunately we only stayed one night the hotel seems over priced for what it actually offers was disappointing as it was part of our honeymoon
