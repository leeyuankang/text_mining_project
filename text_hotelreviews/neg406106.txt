only slight negative experience was when we booked a meal on the roof terrace but the weather was going to turn so we had to eat inside which wasn t a problem but for the money we spent on the meal the experience wasn t great no background music in a room with not many people in meant that there was zero atmosphere we ordered a bottle of red wine and we re brought a bottle of white so we asked for it to be changed the head waiter then came over to us asking why we had changed our minds about the wine we found this very awkward and rude i ordered a risotto and got a burger which after the wine saga i said nothing and just ate it we paid and we re given no change we were going to leave it as a tip anyway but a little presumptuous of the staff we thought
