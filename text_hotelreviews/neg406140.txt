if you are reading this i suspect that you are interested in booking this hotel if so i heed and plead you not my learned friend during my short stay days nights at this hotel dei cavalieri it has been a series of unfortunate events this can be witnessed by events that my mother and i experienced throughout my stay i should have seen the signs the very first moment i stepped into this hotel at the beginning of my trip despite being first in queue and told that my hotel room was still not cleaned yet my mother and i waited on the side a blonde lady served me whose name i sadly did not manage to catch because during the multiple times we exchanged conversations she failed to wear her tag this hotel staff told me that once they received a telephone call from the cleaners i could head to my room subsequently an italian family behind me was also told that their room was also not cleaned yet and they waited thereafter once she received a telephone call the blonde lady gave the hotel key card to the bell boy to serve the italian family whilst my mother and i were left at the lobby it was only after serving several guests that my mother asked for the blonde lady to kindly check if our room was ready without any surprise considering she received the phone call a while back she finally handed us our key card the second event would be during the provided breakfast i have not mentioned my ethnicity but i believe that it has something to do with the ill service that my mother and i received both my mom and i are chinese when my mother and i went to sit at a three person table for breakfast we were blatantly told off that we could not do so however next to the table that we chose were two blonde ladies sitting at a four person table once we pointed out that to the waiter and asked his reasoning for allowing them to do so but not us he quivered and finally let us sit down
