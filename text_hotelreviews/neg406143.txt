the air conditioning for most of the common areas of building except for the lobby was most likely non operational i know the ac in our room didn t work because i was forced to fight with the night staff about sweating while he tried to convince me it was because the thermostat was set incorrectly he sent someone up yo check it and he set it to deg with no relief finally at am after trips to the lobby and one phone call he allowed us to change rooms bad night of sleep no offer of compensation no apologies at check out the staff member who was very nice otherwise clearly had no interest in my troubles the shower was also an awkward affair with the shower head in the middle of a narrow tub a position that allowed it to spray around the room because the shower glass only covered of the tub
