we have booked one room for adults with single beds as was advertised by the hotel which was actually the main reason us choosing this particular hotel when we arrived we were offered a room with one double bed and one sofa that is why we asked on the reception to change the room after this the new room was offered to us which was located on the floor with the restaurant and no other guest rooms this room was actually looking more like a room for servants there were proper beds and another one was a camping bed which was not actually suited to sleep we therefore asked again for a room change and were told there are no triple rooms available and it is a fault of booking com as they did not receive our reservation stated that we need rooms after a long discussion we got a key to another room for one of us when we entered the room we realised that there was already a guest in this room the reception ladies were most unhelpful and incompetent finally we could have proper rooms for this night but we were promised a triple room for the next one when we came back the next evening and needed to check in into another room we specifically asked if the room has beds and were told that yes what we had was beds and camping bed we had to fight again this time that finally the hotel would provide us with a third bed once the bed was installed another surprise it did not have a blanket we asked and were told that there are no more blankets left again a discussion with the reception until they brought us one so all in all we spent more than two hours during our weekend arguing with the hotel this is definitely not a star standard so if you want to spend nice time in milan there are for sure better options for this price
