staff at reception was a bit unfriendly the lady who did check in for us made us feel uncomfortable by her tone of voice slightly rude like she was so sorry she had to serve us no sleepers and bathrobe in the room shower was not convenient bell boy did not even offer his help to carry our luggage when we took key after check in but big variety of breakfast overweighted all drawbacks
