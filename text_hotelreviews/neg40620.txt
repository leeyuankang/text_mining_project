the guy at reception who greeted us was a little bit grumpy he could have smiled more even if we didn t speak french he was explaining things with a bossy attitude like we did everything wrong i appreciate though his effort to speak english the other lady who checked us out was all nice and smiling the internal doors in the room could have been a little bit more modern there is a huge contrast between the modern things around even tv and the internal doors but that s a very little detail maybe an advice for future
