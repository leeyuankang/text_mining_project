we did not like the fact that the spa has no staff at the spa center the towels run out the tea pots are not replenished the guests have to go up to reception and ask for things they go back down and check the info provided then they notice that on the shelves on which towels were supposed to be there were none because the receptionsts had no way of knowing if towels had already been depleted
