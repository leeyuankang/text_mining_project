the room was very clean but the cleaning lady didn t replace the shower gel as it was finished and that was very annoying ad i realised it only when i was under the shower she also left a cup of coffee instead of replacing it with a clean one they say they offer you coffee and biscuits for breakfast there ware no biscuits after lunch i was in my room and i hear the door opening it was a cleaning lady looking for another cleaning lady are you serious privacy that unknown word
