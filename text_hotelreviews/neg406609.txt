i opted to include breakfast however we left for the airport at which was before breakfast they didn t offer anything for that the restaurant tries to hard to be fancy and is over priced and not great i selected that hotel bc they advertised airport shuttle i went back to look and they do offer it twice once just airport shuttle and the other airport shuttle additional charge you can imagine i was frustrated when i discovered it would cost euro to go to the airport the room was very hot and the ac didn t work quit right and of course it s down town so loud with the window open
