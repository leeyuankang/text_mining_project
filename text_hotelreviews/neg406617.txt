the included breakfast was not that good not much variety and too crowded and understaffed to cope the staff were nice but there just wasn t enough of them for example very hard to even get a coffee or juice for the crowds and when i got there the juice was all gone accordingly there was not much value to the included breakfast these buffet breakfasts can be a shambles if not done properly
