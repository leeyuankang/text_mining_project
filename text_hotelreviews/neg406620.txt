it is not only that there was no heating in the room the centralized air condition pushed cold air it was real freezing in the room despite my phone calls and my requests from the staff to warm a little bit the room they did nothing i have been few times in this hotel rooms are not very big saying in understatement but the location is good however it is in un expectable that one chooses a stars hotel in the center of milan with the adequate price and need to freeze in the room while the staff is so helpless
