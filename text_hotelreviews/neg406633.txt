for the price of the hotel it isn t that flash but it is old and dated room service finishes at so if you re coming in late don t expect a meal breakfast wasn t bad but nothing outstanding i have stayed in many hotels in milan and understand they are generally expensive but this is a bit much for what it is in my opinion also aircon didn t work photos make the place look better than it is in saying that the staff were very friendly and we re able to help with everything
