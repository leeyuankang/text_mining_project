we stayed in the floor since in the morning it was noisy like crazy the cleaning ladies would not stop moving stuff near our room every morning since the walls are thin it was impossible to sleep pass that time the electricity if the room stops at am or so so we had to get up to put the card in and out again the heater stops around am so it s very cold so we wore extra hot clothes but we woke up at early in the morning sweating because the heat was back again that was a nightmare i know this problem isn t just in this hotel but a few others in milano but it doesn t make it better also it is above the subway metro so you can hear it all the time or feel its vaibration
