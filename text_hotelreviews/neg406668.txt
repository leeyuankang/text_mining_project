light sleepers be aware metro makes rumbling noise when it passes we were on the second floor price quality was rather poor for a euro day price you would expect some more room and comfort although it could be the additional city tax the rooms are a bit dated there are smoking and non smoking rooms be aware of this when booking we were non smokers and got a room that smelled from years of smoking
