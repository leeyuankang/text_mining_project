it appears that the hotel do not look at booking requests at the time they allocate rooms we booked a superior room with bath quiet room if possible and booked breakfast at time of booking at checkin he said that i now had to pay for breakfast as i didn t book i insisted i did book then he told us after having a look at reservation don t worry now this doesn t matter so obviously didn t look at any request or booking we made on web site we got a small triple room with tiny shower on second floor outside was metro line totally the opposite what we requested after entering the room i brought this this to their attention and rooms later we got room with bath why didn t they save the hassle for us and just give us this room the reaction of the reception staff at this time didn t make us feel that our issue was that important breakfast is well below what was expected two days the same cold scrambled egg both days on buffet coffee machines not working there was other items on buffet cooked meats cheese pastries and bread rolls which all looked fine hotel is ok and fine as we never spent much time inside but if we had to spend time inside hotel i would have looked at another hotel we expected more for the price we paid and the rating the hotel has
