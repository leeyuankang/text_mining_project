i am a hotelier student in the best school in the world so i know exactly how check ins need to happen there is one girl forgot the name in the front office staff that was beyond rude i was ready to fight with her when you work in a hotel in the front office department your attitude needs to be on the side when we already checked in at for the room but the room you gave us was not going to be ready before we were kind enough to leave and come back later at because we wanted to spend our day out but when i come back tired after the whole day and you make me wait saying you cannot find the reservation and that it doesn t exist and on top of that shake your head and when i try to approach you in order to help with a solution or communicate you yell and give me your hand in my face you need to back off and respect your body language gestures and communications and question yourself whether you belong to work in a place like the hospitality industry thank you
