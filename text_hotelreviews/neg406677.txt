we had booked a room with a kitchenette which was clearly stated on our booking we were given an inferior room after minutes wasted of our holiday arguing and after speaking to booking com they agreed to move us to the room we had booked but charged us euors extra per day for that the staff were quite unfreindly and unhelpful the room was good but the shower had either very hot or very cold water we ended up showering the kids by the pool instead
