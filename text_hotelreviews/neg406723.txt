although the entrance hall and public areas on the ground floor were spacious upstairs was a warren of narrow corridors and it was very easy to lose your bearings clearer signs are needed we were genuinely concerned about getting out if an emergency had arisen we think the hotel should address this issue the room was smaller than we expected this was ok for a couple of nights but not for longer stays really slow lifts which led to queues and they always seemed to be full when they finally arrived the stairs were narrow and also difficult to locate checkout was not very swift or smooth they initially tried to charge us for breakfasts which were included in our booking this error was rectified immediately when we protested we overheard the same thing happening to other guests it seemed a bit odd as details of our booking were on their computer system overall we felt the hotel was rather overpriced for what it is we will not return nor recommend it to friends
