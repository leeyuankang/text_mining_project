i have read good reviews on this hotel on booking com so i decided to make a reservation for family room for my trip to milan at the start of my holidays night and at the end of my holidays nights the first time me and my family arrived we received two connected rooms with bathrooms however the second time we arrived around weeks later despite booking the exact same room same price at the same time with the first time we received a completely different room the room we received the second time is very small with a king sized bed and a sofa bed yes i repeat a sofa bed for a stars hotel really i went down to talk to the receptionist who claimed that she is a hotel manager she has claimed that the first time was a upgrade we were not inform about that at all she has also excused that it could be because her english was not perfect hence the reason why we could not understand her my family and i were left extremely disappointed and unhappy with this unacceptably inconsistent service and staff explanation we will not come back to this hotel ever again
