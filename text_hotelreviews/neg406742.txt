hot room with dysfunctional ac we were looking out for a restful night before our international flight out of milan staff on duty could not rectify the problem the gm of the hotel informed us the next morning that ac was under maintenance the rest of the common areas were nicely air conditioned met another guest who had faced a similar problem secondly we were told that the airport taxi would come in minutes but it did not turn up at all then they booked another taxi by which time we were quite sure we would miss our flight very stressful day in milan
