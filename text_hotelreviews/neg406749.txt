the website pictures were very misleading for per night i was really disappointed by the standard of the first room we were allocated as i had opted to pay extra for the superior room but had been allocated something below the standard i d expect even when compared to an ibis standard room also the hotel pool was tiny again clever photography made it look considerably bigger than it was
