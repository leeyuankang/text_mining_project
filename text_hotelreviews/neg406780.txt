the first two days my room flooded while i shower not even a little flood the whole room would flood and no body helped me at all and to add insult to injury they decided to ask me if i knew how to shower correctly and didn t even take the blame it was their fault the bathroom was defective or apologize after the second day they changed my room but still no apology or compensation or anything
