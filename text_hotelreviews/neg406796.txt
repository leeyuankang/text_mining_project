when i come into the room i was very upset because they gave me standard double room with extra bed even though i made a reservation for family junior suite room when i checked in they confirmed the room was same that i reserved they cheated on me and without any apologies they continued to make an excuse and all of sudden they showed another room which was totally different room and i refused their execuse was very ridiculous and i felt very angry finally they gave me broader room saying that this is largest one in this hotel i did not largest one i just wanted the room i reserved for my xmas holiday with my family if you make reservation with family junior suite room you must check room and their face which it tell you truth or not in the same evening i couldn t sleep at all but no more claim cause it was christmas and there were three receptionist andrea victoria and one lady who gave me the lie with false smile
