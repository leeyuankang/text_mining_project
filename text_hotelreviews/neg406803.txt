in my experience the staff were not welcoming nor were they skilled in their jobs there was confusion from the start at reception about my reservation and they made mistakes entering the information that caused a problem at checkout in the end everything was resolved but the lack of professionalism caused unnecessary problems and delays for me no apologies were offered
