it is really a terrible experience and the only bad memory for us in this trip in europe firstly the location of this hotel is too close to the metro station which i thought it would be one of the advantages at first actually it is toooooo close that i could feel every train passes by so that we felt like having a terrible sleep on the train for the whole night secondly the hotel insisted that they provided us with one economy double room that i could not believe it is a room for two guests till now i could hardly place two pillows in a line and we could only lay still there not sleep so you can imagine how narrow the bed is the room has one bottle of water one bath towel and one facecloth so i guess every guest would define it is a room for one person but the staff in the reception answered me it is a double room and insisted you booked one economy double room okay i have no choice as it is the first stop in italy for me after a long trip we are so tired to move anymore so i did not hesitate for a second to cancel the next night stay in this hotel and book another hotel which can provide me with a normal double bed btw i stopped one of the staff on the corridor who just passed by and asked him whether my room is a double room or single room he said he could not tell me what kind of room it is thirdly it is the only hotel in my trip in europe this time for two weeks that could not lend us an adaptor and did not help us with carrying luggages i guess the guests who booked the economy double room do not deserve assistance last but not least the wifi signal is weak so i guess i will never ever choose this hotel
