the breakfast was completely inadequate and not what i would expect of a star hotel there was very little fruit and it kept running out there was a shortage of larger cups the breakfast area and amount of food was inadequate for the amount of guests eating it is also completely misrepresented in the booking com website as there are several photographs of a beautiful breakfast area
