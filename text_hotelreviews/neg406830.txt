due to uncontrollable flights changes in our schedule months prior to our vacation we no longer needed our hotel in milan because we would be flying out of rome however even though we tried for months to cancel the reservation or credit it to a future stay at another location the best western absolutely refused to work with us and refused to refund our money or give us a credit we had to put a dispute in with our credit card company which is still being sorted out now i would never recommend staying at any best western if this is their attitude towards customer satisfaction
