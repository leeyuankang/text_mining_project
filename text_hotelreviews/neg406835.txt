we booked for our milan stay in february and our stay was in late july we did not get any of our requests for either a connection room nor rooms next to each other nor even on the same floor the staff seemed reluctant to help at first but after numerous visits to the reception we finally got another room on the same floor as the kids the first room was a nightmare you would open the door and it was only a foot away from the bed actually there was only a small distance from the bed to everything else around feet
