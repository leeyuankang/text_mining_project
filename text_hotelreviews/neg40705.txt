the top floor rooms get very noisy during bad weather so can be hard to sleep one member of staff was particularly rude arrogant condescending towards us any complaint was met with a bad attitude very unprofessional fortunately his colleagues were there to fix the situation and offer us a much better less noisy alternative room for our second night no excuse for rude behaviour towards your guests
