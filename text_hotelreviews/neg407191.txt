i really love the hotel and take every opportunity to stay there as i simply love the stuff the location the beds this time we were given the room for the disabled which i did not quite like and i would say that also the room was prepared just for one person so ihad to call the reception to ask for additional pair of sleepers and then kept realising there were not enough bath products since the visit was quite brief visit i did not want to waste my time complaining or calling the front desk again however this is something i would want to avoid having during my next visit
