you need to walk down a flight of stairs to get to the lobby of the hotel when we arrived we were tired and sleepy and didn t realized you could press a button on the wall to call for the bellboy porter with a big luggage it was a struggle to carry it down the stairs luckily the bellboy saw us and quickly came forward to carry our luggages be careful when you shower in the toilet it gets wet everywhere as there is no shower curtain
