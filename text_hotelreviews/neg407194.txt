there is no ventilation in the room the ventilation is with air conditioning meaning you have to turn on the ac to have some air in the room you cannot only turn on the ventilation and you have to set up a low temperature to turn it on making the room either very cold or very dry uncomfortable i stayed two nights and did not sleep well for both nights same for my mum traveling with me apart from that one thing requiring improvement is the efficiency of the service i reserved minutes for check out considering the train station is just near by but it took around minutes for waiting for just person in front of me when it was my turn the stuff took a long time to check our information in the system and then he asked help from another colleague who was handeling either another client almost taking another mins to get to payment i consider myself a patient person but at last i kindly lost that if i don t claim sorry sir but our train is in mins they wouldn t say something as sorry for keep you waiting and i would not know how much time will we still be waiting luckily we sucesssfuly had the train in the last minutes but generally a good hotel with excellent location with access to every transportation i would suggest the hotel improves its service and install a good ventilation system
