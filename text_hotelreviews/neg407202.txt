one gentleman at the front desk acted rather unprofessionally toward me at check out i stayed for nights and upon check in i let them know a friend would join me for of the nights the woman who checked me into the hotel added my friend to the reservation informing me of the minor additional fee for a second guest for the two nights when i checked out the same woman who served me at check in was working she presented me with a separate invoice for the agreed upon up charge for my guest s two nights which i happily paid a short time later another male staff member from the front desk came into the lobby and hassled me about signing some type of documents relating to my refusal to pay for the extra nights my guest stayed when i told him this wasn t the case he persisted and was very rude threatening to report me to the police i was shocked and dismayed i showed him my separate invoice with the extra fees for the agreed upon two nights as proof that the understanding at check in was always two nights only and reassured him this was indeed the length of her stay he continue to demand that because of an error in how it was logged into their reservation system i need to sign a refusal to pay form if i wasn t going to pay the extra fee for all five nights despite the hotel being fantastic in all other regards i would strongly hesitate to stay with them again due to this incident and this specific employee this is a shame because all of my experiences with other front desk staff were excellent i m still shaking my head that this hotel employee was so obnoxious in trying to make me responsible for an error the hotel made in their reservation system
