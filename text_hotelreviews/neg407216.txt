the breakfast is atrocious on several levels it is really a shame that an otherwise nice hotel has such a poor quality breakfast room which small and cramped and in the basement so has no natural light the quality of the food was dismal the hot food was cold and when they tried to reheat it the reconstituted scrambled eggs became greenish grey and clumped together just awful adding freshly cooked eggs costs euros extra per egg when most hotels provide omelette bars and fresh eggs as part of the breakfast when we arrived for breakfast it was just after and many items were already gone we were so disappointed after the first day we found our breakfasts outside the hotel even though we had prepaid at the hotel and were not expecting a refund also the location near the main station is not so salubrious and its a bit scary around there at night time
