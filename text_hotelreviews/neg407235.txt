i was charged during the night the whole amount of my booking with extras without my consent even when the hotel receptionist knew that i wanted to pay by cash the whole amount its been debited from my card and as a result it looks like i had pay the hotel two times never recieved from mr bruno a confirmation that the money was going to be unblocked never had a proper explanation not happy about this tricky transaction when you book in bookings they say that no amount will be charged but at this point i have to say it isnt true
