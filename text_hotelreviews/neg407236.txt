i was charged to my credit card the whole amount of the booking including extras during the night aldo i informed the receptionist my desire to pay by by cash at the time of check out i payed again for the whole amount by cash and after days the amount debited by the hotel hasnt been unblocked as a result it looks like i have payed the hotel two times mr bruno from the reception wasnt able to reassure me and now i had to call the hotel to ask them to refund asap the whole amount charged to my card as pre authorization i was told by mr davide by phone that it might take to days for the hotel to unblock the amount from my card im unhappy about this issue since mr bruno didnt even gave me a copy of the pre authorization costumers should be informed and during the booking here in bookings com the offer said that no amount was going to be charged to my credit card but it isnt true
