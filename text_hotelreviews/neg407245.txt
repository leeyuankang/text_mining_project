staff bellboy was the worst i have ever seen arrived at the hotel with huge luggages the bellboy stood at a distance watching us while we carried the luggages down a flight of stairs to the lobby upon arriving at the lobby he suddenly came over and said sorry for not helping we didn t have a good impression of him and so we told him it was ok we would push our luggages to our room ourselves he insisted and snatched the of the luggages away from us and asked if we speak english in a degrading way when we reached our room he stood outside the room waiting for us to tip him what we explicitly said we didn t want your help you snatched the luggage from us we tipped him anyway and he left after settling down we felt that the room was a little stuffy so we called the hotel frontdesk and asked if the a c could be turned on to our dismay they sent the same freaking bellboy up he came into the room and said you speak english you speak english english note all these while we replied him in perfect english nothing less and btw his english wasn t even good to begin with he couldn t even understand when we said the room was stuffy he just kept asking if we knew english we chased him out after a few minutes what a terrible start to our milan trip don t ever book this hotel unless you want a similar experience there are many other hotels in the same area if you are looking for accessibility
