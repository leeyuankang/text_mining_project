the restaurant was not good too many dishes on the menu were not available although we were early and just one table was full when we arrived the quality of two of the dishes was not good both veel which had too much fat in it not at all great we had to sign a disclaimer for possible damage to our car it being parked by the valet this did not insturen us at all and we were glad to see it back in one piece the next morning first time ever and we have used the valet service at many hotels without private parking
