checking in we really wondered if the desk clerk was going to let us stay she was offended that we had booked through booking com instead of directly with the hotel when i said it was too good a deal to pass up she looked at me like i was suggesting something foul i had to ask if there was a problem with the reservation before i could get her to move forward and give us our keys shower door was weird we had people rooms and none of us were able to shower without getting the floor wet felt sorry for housekeeping to have to deal with our soaked towels on the floor
