actually the only problem i noticed was at the breakfast i m used to places where the breakfast end time is actually the time when they close the doors for customers to get into the breakfast room at starhotels anderson not only they did closed the door but they also started very quickly to remove the food that was available this is not that bad but assuming you got into minutes before the end of the breakfast you will need to as greedy as your hungry asks you to be
