this time the room was not so nice chipped furniture a towel rail that came away in my hand a shower that left you wading through water as it didn t go down the tap fast enough and when i and my friend whom i had recommended the hotel to asked to leave at was told that was fine it would be free for one room but euros for the rooms made me regret recommending the place as on my own i could have stayed the extra hours for nothing we decided not to bother left on time and went and had lunch instead but as a relatively frequent customer it rankled a bit and next time i might try somewhere else
