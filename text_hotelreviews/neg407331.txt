the steps leading from the entrance to the lobby you can struggle to carry a large suitcase up and down the steps although the doormen were always willing to help i didn t like the look of the lobby and the lounging area it was dark gloomy a little bit eerie and filled with naked pictures the corridoor leading to the hotel room was also very dark and uninviting
