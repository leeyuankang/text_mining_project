we had no water one night they kept saying it was going to come on at or the times came no water it was terrible we never got water until the next day staff was not very helpful as to not honoring me the price i received from booking com there was a huge confusion with the reservation they would not speak english when it came to the price they advertised they did speak english and pretended they did not know much english i have to check my bill but i think i was overcharged every day they charged my room many times i went upstairs and could not get into my room and had to go to the desk for them to fix my key everything was a hassle all the way around very disappointing i will not stay here ever again
