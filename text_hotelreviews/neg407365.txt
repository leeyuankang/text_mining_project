i had a very bad experience on the second night there was no water in the hotel could not take a shower or wash your hands it was awful my reservation was also messed up they kept charging me everyday a different price and i was very annoyed i was promised by my reservation on the computer a certain price and they did not honor the price i speak a little italian but i was annoyed they would not speak english during the discussion of the price of the room they advertise we speak your language and it seemed like they were pulling something over on me but i won t know until i get my credit card bill
