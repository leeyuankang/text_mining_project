i was surprised that the man at the front desk when i checked in was rather rude he started by helping someone who arrived after me i didn t say anything because i try to be easy going when i travel then he was explaining something to me in a confusing way and i didn t understand even though i was politely asking him to repeat himself he got annoyed with me which i don t like if i am paying good money to stay somewhere and am being polite the truth is it is his job to be polite not mine the other man he helped first was rude maybe if i was rude he would have helped me first and been more polite to me i know i might be the person he s talked to that day but still we had been traveling all night on planes and shuttles and were really tired it made it kind of a bummer to be treated so rudely when we first got to italy and after that i didn t want to ask for help with things like where is a good restaurant etc the other woman at the front desk was friendly enough as were the restaurant servers bell man etc but the damage had been done by our initial greet it s unfortunate i would like to stay at a place like that when i am in milan because it is so nice and clean i just don t know if i will as a friendly front desk is so important to feeling good in a foreign country if customer service isn t important to you then definitely stay here
