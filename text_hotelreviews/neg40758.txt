room design was poor especially the bathroom looks beautiful but completely impractical hand basin attached to wall and no flat surfaces near the hand basin so no place to stand shaving cream or even contact lens cases lighting from down lighters looks ok but none on the mirror so impossible to shave or insert contact lenses as face is in shadow shower floor was mosaic and either marked or dirty bedroom had venetian blinds which didn t darken the room so was awake at sunrise at the rooms need dark curtains as well as the blinds i asked for a quiet room and my room overlooked an outside area of a nearby pub so was pretty noisy enough pillows and cushions and cushions for a rugby team
