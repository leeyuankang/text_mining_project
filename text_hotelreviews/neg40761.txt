room was small dusty uncomfortable house keeping was erratic no clean towels provided coffee not replaced no water in the room despite being advertised as such very noise air vents outside so couldn t open the window aircon on the other hand was very noisy even when switched off ticking i used to be happy to stay in this hotel but over the past few years it has clearly deteriorated my room requests were ignored every time and the fact that i am a frequent guest doesn t seem to make a difference it s a shame but i won t be staying here anymore
