i guess it s because it s mainly used for business but the decor in public spaces and rooms was rather drab mainly brown and beige and the the bar and restaurant were priced for those with expense accounts however the food we did have in the hotel was very good and the city is full of excellent bars and restaurants within a few minutes walk from the hotel if you want a bit more atmosphere and less cost the large sofas near the reception area looked really stylish but were quite uncomfortable and difficult to get out of if you re not fully mobile
