when i booked for days i was told that i would have free breakfast when i got there they said that i only had free days they picked the days well for of the days they picked i had extremely early trips planned i would leave before breakfast even started they would not switch my breakfast days considering the money i spent i was very disappointed and felt robbed it seemed very cheap and penny pinching on the hotels part
