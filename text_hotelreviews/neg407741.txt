the bed was a little hard but we still slept ok the wifi worked well but you had to have the tv on to use it which is a little odd not a big deal just a minor inconvenience the rooms felt a bit dated in a bad way and ours had a bit of a mustiness to it again small details but depending on your level of pickiness they may bother you
