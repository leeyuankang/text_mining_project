the bed was a little firm for our taste but that is likely just a matter of opinion it wasn t uncomfortable by any means and i slept fine both nights the room wouldn t stay as cool as we liked either though i could have been using the thermostat incorrectly ha we like it quite cool when we sleep and i couldn t get it to stay below degrees there was a mild smell of cleaner powder when we entered the room that wasn t all that appetizing but i suppose that is better than it smelling bad dirty or smokey unless you are a smoker of course all these are minor issues at an otherwise nice hotel
