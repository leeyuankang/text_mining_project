the description of the hotel says u can enjoy breakfast however not every room contains such an offer the description of the room offer is also not clear as to whether breakfast is included the price of the breakfast is not mentioned anywhere in the hotel and the charges are made without prior consultation to the guest the staff of the restaurant was quite rude to me when i said i was surprised with the charges that were being made to me first time this kind of thing ever happened to me when using booking com i would say you can find better offers in the city aparently they also blame the guests for employees being too expensive in italy wtf
