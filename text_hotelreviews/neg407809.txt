i didn t like they way i was received and treated when i arrived i did not see anything when i was making my reservations online that my booking was limited i didn t notice that my booking can t be changed or cancelled so i booked for night but i stayed for night no refund for my one night i went one day for breakfast and i was changed but hotel owe me for night which i thought really that very unfair asked all staff for help but nothing
