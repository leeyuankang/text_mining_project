the breakfast is less than stellar and the breakfast staff is rude and not helpful but then you will find it very difficult to find any helpful italian and whatever you do do not ask an italian for directions they will lead you astray intentionally or simply pretend as though they do not know where obvious landmarks are located although you will discover it s obvious to local people italy in general depends on tourist sales but they also appear to hate the invasion of tourists so there is a sort of a love and hate relationship with tourists so just keep in mind that they want your money but they don t particularly want you there tourists are tolerated for the sake of their money this is not my first trip to italy so it took me a few trips to discover this perspective still there are a few exceptions to this italian rule some of the italians are wonderful people but they are definitely the exception not the rule in a sense it is like disneyland you go to see what it s all about and then you get over it really quickly you can lay claim to having done italy but then you visit someplace like prague and quickly wish everyone was as nice as the people in the czech republic i m a born and raised californian and have no relationship to prague hope this review helps happy and safe travels
