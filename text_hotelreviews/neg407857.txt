no tea making facilities but we had our own little kettle staff let down by poor attitude of the young concierge he grabbed our cases when we were booking in and sort of grunted when he saw the size of the tip i gave him from check in to our room must have been steps that really annoyed me the staff at david s restaurant were very efficient and attentive and deserve praise
