london itself is ridiculously expensive we paid for the night for a basic room relatively speaking to the surrounding areas this was exceptional value rationally speaking the room was very small and a little dated for a fairly expensive rate the bathroom was my least favourite part of the room as any shower made the majority of the floor sopping wet and the door is opaque so not the best privacy for using the facilities despite that though the hotel was great overall and i d absolutely stay there again and recommend it to anyone visiting london
