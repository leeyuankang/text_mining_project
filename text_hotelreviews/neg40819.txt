rooms are small if you re with persons sharing the room bathrooms are cramped and the whole bathroom floor gets wet when you re taking a shower due to a shower curtain that hangs at least cm above the floor even though the rooms have sound proofed windows the noise from the traffic especially the frequent sirens of emergency services are disturbing your sleep we moved towards the back of the hotel for our second night and still i was woken up by the street noise
