odd that a posh hotel was pushing adult channels in the rooms don t people have the internet the dinning room was great but the plastic tables and supermarket breakfast was a let down staff were not the same standard as the hotel the bar was dirty and always had to get up to ask for things despite there being people behind the bar chatting to each other all in all a great hotel but not well run
