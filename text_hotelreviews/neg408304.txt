a boutique hotel only floors my room was on the and the elevator only goes up to the i think this hotel is quite pricey compared to other bigger hotels in the same neighborhood with more facilities when they made the preauthorization on my card i asked them to release this amount held and pay my room with it but it was not possible so i had to use another card until they released the amount after days as it was easter time
