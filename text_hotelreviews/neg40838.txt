when we re entered the hotel just after midnight we were greeted with a locked door and amateurish sign asking us to push a button and wave our card at a member of staff to let us in i understand the need to keep the door locked at night for security reasons but a star hotel of this size should really have a key card entry system in place rather than leaving its guests freezing on the doorstep for someone to let them in
