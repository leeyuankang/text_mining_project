most of the hotel staff were very friendly but the waitress at the hotel bar was very poor i would have to ask twice for a coffee wait minutes for the coffee to be made even when there were no other customers and the waitress was not busy then i would have to wait another minutes for the same waitress to take my money even after asking for the bill she was definitely making things purposely difficult this made me stop going to the hotel bar there were pickpockets and thieves operating near the hotel my mobile phone was stolen from inside a restaurant near the hotel
