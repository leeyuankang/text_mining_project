the staff could be nicer and more attentive specially the receptionists that were rude during our check in and check out furthermore we forgot a charger in the room and when we called the hotel to search for changer they said that we had to send an email that they took more than days to answer saying they did not find it two days later they send us an email saying that they had found it the price is too high and the restaurant is more like a bar with very few options
