noise we were allocated a room above the bar on the first floor which was extremely noisy and we were unable to rest well at the hotel the room vibrated with the bass of the music which went on past midnight and it also vibrated with every single train and tram that passed by so we were constantly woken up and tired during the trip the front desk was very slow at responding to requests concerning the noise from the bar
