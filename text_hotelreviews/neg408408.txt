the room location was much to be desired is located at the far end of the hotel i asked for a queen size bed but was given two single beds put together the bed was comfortable until you fall through the middle which i did and sprained my ankle in the process especially annoying due the the fact i called the lobby when i entered my room just to express my concern yet they said they think i will enjoy it the shower was very small hardly enough space to turn without hitting your elbow on the glass door or wall elevator broke but wasn t confirmed fixed before letting the public us it i got stuck on the floor which is weird cause another guy got off at the floor the elevator was out of service for a couple of days but when it was supposed to be fixed i got trapped inside luckily it still moved when i pressed the floor button and got out walked the stairway down after that
