first night was a disaster room on the first floor and they had a disco going on loudly until past midnight apparently that happens very often the room also faces the main road where a tram passes by every minutes and that is like an earthquake throughout the night impossible to get any sleep and very stressful they arranged for me to move to a room higher up on the floor and facing the back the following night so it was ok wifi is poor there is no password and it resets every hours or so so if your phone is on roaming and the internet resets in the meantime you are in trouble also the network disappears quite frequently room service is very poor the menu in the room has old prices and when they give the receipt it has a higher price in it they also charge you an additional on top of the prices quoted in the menu for having it served in the room which is not stated anywhere in the menu itself
