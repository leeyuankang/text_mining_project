i think nyx is a brand new hotel and it showed in a few ways especially regarding customer service one example it was difficult to get ahold of the front desk over the phone i asked for an iron and the front desk personnel said i needed to check in at the front desk to get clearance to go to an ironing room i went to the front desk and waited and waited and waited i decided to wear something else to dinner their processes were just a little clunky and lacked a service mindset for their guests
