experience at front desk definitely a star standard front desk is short staffed with some poorly trained staff who have minimal understanding of customer service i will definitely not recommend this hotel to anyone there have been multiple developments of hotels in milan in the last few years pick one of those would suggest further hospitality training for staff in the future long wait lines are multiple times during the day and night bill was not ready upon return to pick up luggage despite giving hours notice instead of reimbursing the fee for incidentals that was charged at check in i was informed to wait business days to have that refunded by the bank this is not how incidental charges should work i shouldn t have to follow up with bank to confirm days after the fact especially when no additional charges were incurred during the stay
