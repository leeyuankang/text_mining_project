check in and check out took a long time most of the check in attendants were nice and personable however one ran not so much we arrived early around noon and couldn t check in until as we were told that s the standard check in time however when we were checking out around a couple of days later we saw several people check in and immediately get their room keys i d like to think their rooms just happened to be ready and ours wasn t but when we checked in before we even begin the process we were told we couldn t check in until or after though the rooms was nice there were a ton of ants mainly in the bathroom it appears to be an italy issue or a milan issue bc we ve seen the same but not as many as at this hotel in other hotels the lighting system in the room seemed a bit complex
