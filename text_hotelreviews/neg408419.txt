on the second night i had to change room due to an invasion of ants unusual on the floor of a building the staff were quick to put me into a different room and offered to help with the relocation the internet kept dropping out which is rather irritating the breakfast is poor for this class of hotel i checked it out and decided not to bother finally the lobby music is far too loud and very obtrusive i could hardly hear the staff on check in and also i decided not to eat in the hotel restaurant because of the loud music
