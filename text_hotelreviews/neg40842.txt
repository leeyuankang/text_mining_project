this is a hotel which just doesn t try hard enough nothing is quite as good as it should be check in was complicated due to the member of staff s lack of english i ordered a newspaper but didn t receive it no idea why it remains a mystery as to why why room is described as deluxe small room outdated tv hard bed no do not disturb notice no room service menu breakfast only average which is strange because it is cooked not a buffet pot of lukewarm tea
