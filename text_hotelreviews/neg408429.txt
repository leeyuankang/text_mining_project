we got the room on the second floor which was a little noisy at night when there was music playing at the bar just below us the entrance of the hotel had quite a few steps so it is inconvenient for those bringing a lot of luggage also if you need to iron your clothes you have to go the the ironing room as they do not provide irons in the hotel rooms that was the greatest inconvenience to us
