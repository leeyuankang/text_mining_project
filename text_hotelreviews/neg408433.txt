i was very disappointed because i was given small accessible for persons with disabilities rooms even if i booked double rooms with a big double bed the accessible rooms look different they do not have a shower cabin and they have a really small bed i gave the bad grade for the staff because of the persons who managed my booking it is unprofessional to do this without announcing after complaining about this they gave me an upgrade for a suite and a normal double room so they had availability for the rooms i booked
