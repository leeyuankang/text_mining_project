bathroom incredibly small room facing a pub which meant noise throughout the night way to pricey for what it is upon arrival was asked to make a pre authorization on my card with the amount of the stay so when i made the payment the following morning i had payed twice the price of the stay plus even if it is just a pre authorization on your card it still means you won t be able to use that money for days doesn t make sense why don t they ask for the payment upfront
