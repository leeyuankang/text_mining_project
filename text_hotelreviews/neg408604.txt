we found a trouble connecting to the wifi from our room it did not recognise the wifi and had no signal i know if you go to visit a city you not want to hang on the internet but that was only way to communicate with our family we just needed to be in a bar until we spoke to everyone it might works in rooms located closer to the main reception as our room was the last on the corridor
