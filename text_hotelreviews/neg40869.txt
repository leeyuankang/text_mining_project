an additional deposit of on top of my original booking cost was payable as a pre authorised amount on check in so full stay amount plus i was not aware of the need of the additional deposit being taken as this is not mentioned in the booking com important info this is very haphazardly explained before the amount is taken as a pre authorised deposit when in fact it is the total cost of stay and deposit taken there and then when i queried the amount the member of staff offered a blunt and rather annoyed tone to the response saying i have just told you it is a deposit another colleague then explained in a better tone that it was the actual room amount plus room security deposit the deposit should be refunded on checkout the tone on the initial staff members comment was inappropriate unhelpful and a simply a poor choice of words
