i asked for a room with a bath meaning bath tub i was told that it is a hotel and all the rooms are with a bath it turned out that they meant bath room and not a bath tub they apologised for misunderstanding though it is an ok hotel but since it said stars i had certain expections for the room breakfast and so on if it said or stars from the beginning i would have been less dissapointed
