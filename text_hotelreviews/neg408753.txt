myself and my wife stayed at this hotel early nov i booked it on the basis that is was star and its location seemed ok we stayed for two nights and our sleep was disrupted on both nights firstly because we were awoke at but loud voices and laughing from a room a few doors away i appreciate this was not the hotels fault i banged on there door and asked them to be quiet second nights disruption was due to noise both from above our room and to the sides as the walls seem to be paper thin and any noise from above seems to carry through the floors there was also no tea coffee facilities in the room which i personally would expect in a star hotel the shower area was not in the best hygiene either i am fortunate enough to have travelled all over the world and would go as far to say that a shower cubical in india in a star hotel would have been as clean breakfast supplied is ok but not great would i stay here again no
