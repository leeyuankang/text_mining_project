generally i had the impression that the business model of this hotel is additional services i would not recommend the single room the city view on booking com was a wall away and the room seemed to be built around the bed i could upgrade the room for just like i could upgrade my breakfast for to match the pictures on booking com generally low ceilings very narrow hallways to maximise the number of rooms
