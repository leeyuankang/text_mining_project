the entire property is non smoking as a smoker it is very inconvenient and i will not stay at the hotel again because of this reason i understand the reasons behind that but i am not paying to stay in a place where i have to change and go out in the cold every time i need to smoke a cigarette there are other competing hotels where i don t need to do that
