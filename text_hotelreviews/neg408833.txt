check in was terrible we arrived at to be told our room was not ready this was despite being told we would be charged hour for a late check out the staff who handled our check in were arrogant unhelpful and unsympathetic while waiting for our room to be ready we saw two other guests who were given alternative rooms because their rooms weren t ready when i asked about that no satisfactory response could be given having come off a long journey i was too exhausted to argue we waited there were no offers of drinks not even a glass of water the two times we ordered room service it took more than minutes and countless calls to place the orders the first order which was a very straightforward american pancakes with maple syrup and streaky bacon per listed on breakfast menu arrived in min in the form of pancakes with maple syrup and no bacon and because it came so late we ate them anyway without any butter cream or butter the second room service dinner came over an hour later and if not for multiple calls to chase following breakfast experience it would likely have taken even longer an apologetic staff bastien was so far the only staff who genuinely demonstrated remorse at the shoddy service and removed much of the anger we felt toward the hotel he is the only staff who took some pride in his job everyone else we encountered really sucked needless to say we will never return to this hotel nor recommend it to anybody
