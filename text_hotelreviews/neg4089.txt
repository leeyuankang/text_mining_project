this property is listed as accessible my daughter uses a manual wheelchair but is able to stand for very short periods this facility is only accessible if they set up a motorized device much like a stairway system installed in one s home can you imagine the trouble it would be to have that device set up each time you came and went the embarrassment and time wasted cannot be estimated i ended up carrying my daughter s chair there was not always a doorman present up the steps while my daughter hauled herself up and down using the railing this facility is not accessible unless you come and go once a day with scheduled times in fact when we first arrived a bellman told us there was not a way to get into the hotel w a wheelchair the staff requires education later that evening the manager called and apologized for staff being unaware of the electric system please change your listing to not accessible the table floor lamp was tipsy when we wrote on the surface it would almost tip over the bathroom appeared clean but the shower curtain smelled mildewed
