i booked a deluxe room which is supposedly what i got so i was told but many of the facilities that are listed as part of the deluxe rooms were not there no bathrobe slippers mini fridge iron board also the room was small while the small desk was taken up almost entirely by coffee tea making facilities the wardrobe consisted of hangers while there was basically no space for other clothes in the small drawers by the bed no room for my toiletries in the bathroom all in all i was very disappointed with the the so called deluxe room which i paid a lot more for than the standard room which i usually get and is not markedly different other than the size of the bed
