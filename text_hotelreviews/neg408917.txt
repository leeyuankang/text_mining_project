we had problems with both the initial booking credit card fully charged months early at time of booking when terms were to pay at property and with the initial allocated room due to excess elevator noise room was adjacent to elevator shaft with motor room above in fairness both problems were sorted promptly and appropriately as soon as hotel was notified like so many hotels why provide expensive black out curtains and then have so many lights on electrical equipment in the room tv av ac controls etc so that it is like having the blackpool illuminations on in the room throughout the night nothing better designed to rob the guest of a good sleep
