the limited english has been a huge problem at the front desk most receptionist are not capable of communicating accurately and effectively in a slightly more complex situation for example explaining about room deposit sounds like demanding for extra charge from your debit card these have made check in out unnecessarily long and stressful more senior staff at the front desk has better english but not everyone was received by him her our room hasn t been cleaned when we were back around the cleaner came in when we were still in our bed surprise the tv didn t work which was resolved quickly after we reported it but the same problem happened again later so my husband fixed the cable at the back because we just couldn t be bothered to call again the shower head was leaking but we could shower just okay these issues were not taken any notice when we checked out
