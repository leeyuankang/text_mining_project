its on one side of the train station and the town is on the other side at least a minute walk its also not very safe to walk back there is a shuttle bus but it only runs until i had ti pay euros on my debit card upon arrival as i didnt have a credit card i got this back at the end of the trip in cash in euros which was pointless as i was leaving the hotel was huge but the restaurant tiny breakfast was euros per person per night so we didnt bother
