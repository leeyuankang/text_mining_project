very overpriced for the room the location is very good but the room was underwhelming staff did not tell us that they only stock the mini bar by request only we only found out later when we opened the fridge which forced us to order room service and pay the extra fee of having it be brought up to the room same goes for the robes only on request for the price per night it is not great value for money the bed was not very comfortable and even though we checked in for adults we only got set of shower gel shampoo the staff also did not respond understanding to our complaints
