the bed was so bad i had to ask for a mattress topper and they came to put in mattress cover which didn t make the mattress feel better the cleaning services didn t do a good job i had breadcrumbs on the floor for days and the cleaners didn t even think of vacuuming the room as they knew that i was there for days the pathetic minibar had couple of fisi drinks such as coke and some apple and beer which i don t drink they didn t even offer fresh juice so you basically pay for something you don t even use as the minibar is paid for already with this type of room the nespresso coffee machine was nice to have in the room but what i didn t like is the capsules they offered their own cheap version of capsules it would have been better if they just offered nespresso own capsules which is the best they also were very stingy with water bottles i received only small bottles each day one would think if you get an executive room there would be bottles in the bathroom and in the room at least yet that was another disappointment i would not recommend this hotel to anyone
