staff not friendly or helpfull at all receptionist hiding in the office and playing with smartphone letting people at the counter wait breakfast gets removed to the minute even though the restaurant is still well patronized because of our early morning flight we had to leave the hotel before breakfast to save time in the morning we wanted to settle the bill on the evening before leaving but receptinist refused and argued that this is impossible because of some technical reason with their billing system for a hotel that claims to provide a high swiss service standard i would have expected to get a care package if due to early departure the paid breakfast cannot be attended
