there was a walk in shower but would have preferred a bath however there are a few rooms with a bath but numbers are very limited and we didn t ask at the time of arrival the bathroom had a glass door and although the glass was frosted you could still see someone if they were sat on the toilet which wasn t very private if the glass door had a pattern in the glass this could have given more privacy
