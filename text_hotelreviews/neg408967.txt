very rude staff right from the check in lady and the manager mostly lip service room was extremely bland and old the pillows gave me a pain in the neck and as far as value for money is concerned i paid twice as much as a colleague without any breakfast for the same night my first and last time at this hotel truly my worst experience in a decade of travel
