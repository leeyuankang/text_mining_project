breakfast at cost of should improve significantly i booked the hotel mainly because fantastic memories from couple years ago and the offer deteriorated significantly since then our family is vegetarian and we missed high quality fresh veggies by the way cheapest to get such as lettuce cucumbers peppers kale etc there were only carrots and tomatoes same applies to fresh fruits for this price we missed organic food at all i recall it was there years ago
