the staff are poorly trained we needed to leave early the next morning so i settled my bill for some room taxes the night before my mistake is i paid cash to the reception she gave me a piece of paper which i assumed to be the receipt when i handed in the key the following morning i was told there is no record of my payment the person who took my money has clock off work the morning shift receptionist accepted what i told her they have just implemented a new computer system seems the staff are not adequately trained and the system not tested before they go live on the day i checked in the queue was long and slow i hope they do not charge my credit card again for the tax which i have already paid in cash i will be extremely annoy
