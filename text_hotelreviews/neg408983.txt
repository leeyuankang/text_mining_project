was hoping to check in early as i put the request at booking but being told that room is not ready come back no apologies no suggestions nothing unbelievable for the hotel with this standard unfriendly staff bordering rude i was charged for breakfast which i didn t have as i knew the room comes with no breakfast when i asked why i have been charged she asked me whether i was sure i didn t have breakfast and will check with the slip if i had signed really not impressed and again no apologies
