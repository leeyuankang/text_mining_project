hotel was very busy and crowded it took a long time to check in a long time to check out a long time to get food in the bar where we ate because the restaurant had no space for us to eat for minutes the breakfast buffet was a zoo and there were no provisions for a handicapped person to get food the elevators were almost too small for my husband and two bags and me on the scooter we had trouble getting an elevator to get to and from breakfast just one floor below there were no other options nearby to eat that i could get to easily on the scooter it was not a good hotel for anyone taking an amawaterways cruise it was too far to walk with luggage to the regular river cruise docks if you were not taking a viking cruise
