rock hard pillows made it difficult to sleep and i woke with a crick in my neck no shampoo or conditioner very shocking it s been years since i was in a hotel without them most important i found it very hard to find out how to enter the hotel from the bus platform i had a very heavy suitcase first i went to the concert hall but couldn t find a way to descend two stories the the entrance to the hotel finally i took an elevator from the concert hall lobby to the indoor parking lot terrified i d be locked in fortunately i was able to walk out on the road for the exiting cars and was now on the street level but exhausted after hauling my suitcase hither and yon getting to the front desk was a nightmare
