car parking it is a great underground car park however the hotel staff and booking com s information on car parking is woefully short and not fit for consumer s it is lacking in detail and needs changing the staff at the hotel did not have a clue and gave me misleading information a small gripe but when you are using the hotel as a base to visit clients all over holland it is good to know what you will pay
