i didn t like that we had to pay for incidentals which i was not aware about which took away a big chunk of our spending money and then when we went to get our money back when we checked out they had taken a city tax out of it which would have been fine if we had of been told about it on arrival or before hand just another thing i had booked a double room but arrived to find two single beds with a huge gap in between which i wouldn t count as a double bed other than that good hotel
