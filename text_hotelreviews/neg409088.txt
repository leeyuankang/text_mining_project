at reception upon checking in there were a lot of attempts made by the front desk to upsell us in terms of a different room breakfast all of which were ridiculously overpriced and terrible value for money at a time we were far too tired from the journey to want to have such discussions i understand what i paid for as the booking com website lays things out very clearly i don t want to have to rehash my decisions when checking in the location if you don t have business with the pier is extremely plain boring it s in a fine part of town but if you re travelling to amsterdam just to see the city itself i wouldn t stay down this end this area feels like amsterdam s loading docks
