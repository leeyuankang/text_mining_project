after our excellent dinner the night before breakfast was very disappointing the selection was limited for the size of hotel and the quality of product not great having prepaid the breakfast and already had reception query it but sort it out at check in when we arrived for breakfast we were made to wait minutes while they sorted it out and confirmed again that yes we had indeed pre paid for it very unprofessional for a top name hotel the glasses for orange juice etc were tiny so my husband took a large wine glass and filled that but was told he couldn t use them and when he asked the waiter to please bring four of the small glasses to the table as he likes a large glass of orange juice in the morning the waiter said i don t do table service really a waitress appeared with a paper cup for my husband to have his orange juice in this is not the standard of service we expect from this level of hotel it seemed there were plenty of staff but standing around and not serving or circulating with orange juice coffee etc we told the reception staff on check out who were really apologetic about it and gave my husband a bar of movenpick chocolate by way of apology unfortunately due to the location of the hotel there is nowhere else nearby for breakfast
