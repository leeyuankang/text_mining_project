room service food was appalling it took an hour to arrive the food was bland and the waitress taking the order was not that helpful i was in deluxe room so god help me if i was in the basic double room the bathroom was just about adequate for size the overall decor of the room was very plain i felt slightly claustrophic in the room as the ceiling was quite low and there was not much room between the bed and the desk the receptionist was moderately polite but did not give the impression that he particularly impressed with providing good customer service this is the third time i have stayed at this hotel and i will certainly not be returning
