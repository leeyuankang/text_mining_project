the hotel was undergoing a refurbishment and needs it in a lot of areas we were offered a choice of rooms including a quiet room this turned out to be a pokey double bedroom at the front of the hotel facing onto the square with single glazed windows noisy all night bath did not drain and bathroom was pokey small was changed to a better room on second night which was much better but beware of hit and miss and make sure to ask for a quality room
