i hated the glass door to the bathroom it was practically see through especially after a shower and i don t want to see or be seen while using the toilet there wasn t enough room to put toiletries out either a large shelf would have been good i also didn t like the wet room type shower it was difficult to find somewhere to place pyjamas while having a shower i guess overall i just hated the bathroom it was on a main road so traffic was noisy but i can t say that that bothered me
