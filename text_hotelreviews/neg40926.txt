i was running late for a meeting and wanted to leave my stuff in a room but there were no rooms available i occupied the only double room that was available at the time they did not provide an iron and i had to ask for it as it s included in the room price when i returned late in the evening i found both an iron and an ironing board in the room but they removed ironing facilities again the next day there was only a fixed head shower in the bathroom and i could do with a detachable hand shower
