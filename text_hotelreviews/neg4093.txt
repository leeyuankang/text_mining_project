i generally do not eat breakfast in the hotel partly because carluccio s is close at hand and i am more interested in italian cuisine than a more conservative english hotel cuisine i hesitate to say that i am unhappy with the dining room or the bar because the hotel is so wonderful in other respects nevertheless these might be the only parts of the russell that would benefit from change that being said however few hotels manage change successfully and i would hate to see the russell lose its undoubted charm
