no mini fridge in room as advertised a good tip about the wifi decide if you want to upgrade to premium wifi before you log in to the regular wifi the free wifi was sufficient for email surfing not for youtube i connected with a pop up window on my mac i then bought a premium upgrade for gbp but couldn t use it because i couldn t get the pop up window back again to enter the premium code
