the room s decor was dated lots of dark wood which was scuffed etc which then didn t really make me feel like i was in a four star bedroom we had a power cut too which meant i couldn t use the jacuzzi no iron in the room which was a shame my bed was a double but unfortunately was in fact two singles put together one of which was very lopsided check out took a long time and there was a queue behind me as only one member of staff was there my entry card for my room kept failing which was really annoying as they re apparently affected by being stored near a phone or bank card rooms were quite noisy could hear other guests talking and their tv
