i was the victim of being ripped off by bar staff i was over charged for my drink and when i checked the receipt i realised before i left the bar i said the woman who served me i think you ve overcharged me for my drink without asking or looking at the til she took a fiver out of the til and threw it on the bar now how did she know she had overcharged my by pounds why did she just throw it down without even an apology add to this a mandatory service charge on drinks for absolutely no service at all and someone is definitely trying to rip people off it s a great pity because i loved everything else about the place but we won t stay there again not whilst they have that attitude
