the hotel is unloved cleaning once away from reception is at best superficial there were ingrained stains on the bathroom floor room bath water etc from floors above flows down pipes boxed into the room at time it s like camping by a waterfall the single beds are on casters and sit on hard floors when turning over in ones sleep demonstrates the for every action there is a opposite reaction resulting in the beds colliding when booking i did not realise it was the same hotel i stayed in about years ago the above except the water fall we were on a higher floor comments suit either shame all it need is determined management harry streets
