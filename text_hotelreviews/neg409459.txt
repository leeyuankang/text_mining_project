although i enquired with reception about how i could control the temperature in the room as i had read the instructions in the in room guide to set the temperature and fan speed the member of staff said this did not work in any room and the room temperature was set centrally i asked how i should keep comfortable he says the appliance should be switched off even though it was hot i said before i switched it on but next night though switched off and window open only slightly as had a security chain on it the temperature was still excessive third and final night the staff member said it should be cooler as the outside temperature was going to be cooler c felt like c we had window open as before didn t sleep plusthe noise from the corridor after midnight and from out side all in all created a bad night yet again the member of staff said i could fill in an opinion form to get things changed but this didn t help me a big shame as could have changed the three night break for the better great city good tourist attractions and food shopping luzia son same street was outstanding
