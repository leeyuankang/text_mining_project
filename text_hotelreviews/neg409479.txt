room was shabby in urgent need of a facelift the sauna was closed when we wanted to use it and no towels available the information sent via email before we left said that the pool would be closed for maintenance but then found it was open the first morning i went to make a cup of tea and the milk had gone off which put me off making anymore liptons breakfast teabags would have been nice our friends complained about their room when they arrived and were upgraded to a larger suite and still paid the same money as us
