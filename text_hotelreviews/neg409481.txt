the hotel was very noisy during the day because of the renovation that takes place on the th floor obviously it is needed but in all such cases the travellers should be warned prior to the booking and the hotel was even more noisy during the night because of the shutting noises of the doors the wifi is not secured the sauna should be refurbished just like the fittness area at this point silken ramblas is rather a star hotel
