we really hated being so close to the street in our room as every morning around we were woken by delivery drivers unloading boxes deliveries being wheeled in and out and the sound of glass bottles being emptied into a truck it was unbearably noisy i wish we had complained but we just put up with it as we thought it was a one off but it happened each morning
