as already mentioned we liked nothing the hotel is not clean is not quiet everything is old the towels are grey the bathroom stinks the cleaning ladies bounced all doors every morning etc the receptioner when we checked in was very unpolite she didn t care that we wanted a double room and a quiet one she lied to us in a nutshell it was the most terrible holiday because of this hotel an advice for you booking com please do not cheat with these perfect conditions and for the travelers choose another hotel
