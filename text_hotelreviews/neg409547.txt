some of the facilities did not work like the air conditioning and the extract fan from the bathroom but as it was early spring this was not much of a problem however it would have been had it been warmer weather also with the window open there was a lot of noise from the nearby streets until the early hours of the morning which was a bit of a problem for some of our party
