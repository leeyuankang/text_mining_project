i got the most expensive room in the hotel with a big balcony but the balcony had wires coming out of the wall cheap furnitures like a plastic table and chairs and everything was very dirty as if they hadn t cleaned them for a week at least the ac was off in the whole hotel because of the winter but i could not sleep because it was simply too hot i tried to contact them but they said i should just leave the window open i woke up every day very early sweating an absurd for a euros a night room the furniture on the room was old and completely minimal if i had paid around euros i would gladly review it positively but the best thing should have been the balcony and that was dirty and not comfy at all a waste of money not to mention the facilities at the hotel as the elevators panels broken with buttons falling off entrance hall and all that were simply too old not worth at all as there are other hotels even cheaper that are way better would never recommend
