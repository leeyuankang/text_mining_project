for a rather expensive hotel i found the amenities a bit sparse there was for instance no shower cap maybe a trivial thing but nevertheless the breakfast buffet was rather expensive some euro a big cup of cappuccino and a croissant at starbuck s just around the corner cost only euro less than if you go to one of the local caf s
