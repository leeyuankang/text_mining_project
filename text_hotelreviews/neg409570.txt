the smell the whole hotel seems to be full of some kind of intense room spray perfume it starts as soon as you walk into reception probably to cover up the slight drainage smell that is lingering in the background i had to ask them not to spray my room after they clean because it was so strong and giving me a headache you pay for the location although it is too much for what you get and doesn t meet up to the four stars electric sockets that are very loose hence the light switch on one side of bed also not working i had to body push the door every time i wanted to open and close it window was facing to a building site with very little light and a lot of noise coming in the walls seem paper thin you can hear people talking snoring flushing toilets any of the elevators beeping everytime somebody arrives on your floor even a seam of light at night along the wall above the wardrobe when my room is dark and the light is on in the room next door also the coat hangers in the wardrobe couldn t hold anything heavier than a shirt without falling off i kept finding my coat on the floor
