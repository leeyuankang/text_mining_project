the only thing to ruin completely my stay was how incredibly thin the walls between the guest rooms are i could hear literally every conversation in every single room directly adjacent to my own with astounding clarity alongside with the enormous bang that accompanies every door after closing in the hallway these factors let down the silken ramblas a lovely hotel it itself with so many other positive attributes for these reasons i would choose to stay elsewhere on my next trip to barcelona
