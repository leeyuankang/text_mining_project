abrupt staff whose level of english was generally poor asked for some documents printed for next morning they said fine but when i went to collect they said they didn t have time then they printed them very slowly then after printing told me it was per page wouldn t help me with my luggage couldn t understand my room service order on the phone charge a service charge and a tray charge for per night i expected a higher level of customer service and didn t appreciate the tone of the receptionist when she left me a rude vm telling me to return to the hotel to pack my bags when i had already done so just a disaster in every way tbh thank god it was clean and well located
