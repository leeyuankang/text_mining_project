the bathroom always had a bad odour the room only had one soap bar for three people the room allocated was on the lower level was extremely noisy the cost of the room was exorbitant at australian dollars for four night no breakfast a very small bathroom it was vastly too expensive the hotel has no foyer or sitting area the room did not get cleaned each day until after pm so there was no point coming back to the room for a break we travel each year using booking com at this was the worst value for money for all the four star accommodation we have stayed t i would consider it a star accommodation at best i feel let down by bookings com the hotel is using the booking com rating to vastly inflate the prices i will be a lot more cautious before booking next time caveat emptor
