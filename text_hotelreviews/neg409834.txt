there was no room to store the baggage we had quite a bit of luggage as we were going on a cruise from the hotel so we had to use the kitchen table to lay out the bags aslo the only thing i found bad and a bit dangerous was that there were no grab bars in the shower nor was there a shelf to place the soap and shampoo also the water ran out of the shower area on to the bathroom floor
