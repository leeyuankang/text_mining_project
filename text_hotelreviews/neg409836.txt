i tried many times to correct a problem with the air conditionner dont know if its only room that the air conditionner doesn t work properly every time they would come up to the room to see if the unit was functioning and of course some cool air would always be venting but not efficiently yet in the hallways it was freezing low and behold since this review i am sure the problem has been found
