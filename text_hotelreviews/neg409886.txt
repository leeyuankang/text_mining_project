the pool is too shallow to actually swim in and there was no bottle of cava on arrival because we booked through booking com and not with the hotel and we had to ask for bathrobes the television was a bit on the small side and it would have been nice to have a tv screen in the bedroom we had a great stay though these are only minor niggles
