its not a negative side and has nothing to do with the hotel but i would recommend you to get the taxi to the airport outside the hotel because if you order it from the reception it comes with at least euros on taximeter even before you get inside the cab and then they add some extra charges during the ride thus in our case i was very surprised when we got the extra charge of euros apart from the cost of the airport transfer which normally is around euros
