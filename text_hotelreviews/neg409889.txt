noise the noise is ridiculous both on the street side floor and the square side floor the noise of the traffic is incredible it s a shame since the hotel is fine but if one cannot sleep the entire visit to barcelona is ruined it s incomprehensible since many highway hotels manage to insulate the noise just fine if you want to enjoy your stay in barcelona stay someplace where you will actually be able to sleep otherwise bring some sleeping pills ear plugs and drink lots of coffee the next morning and put up with intolerable noise
