the room was actually quite a bit smaller than i had anticipated for the price our room was not what i d consider a suite but a standard sized room we tried to sit by the pool in the afternoon and there were not enough chairs so we had to leave this was really disappointing as we chose the hotel based on the location and the amazing rooftop pool the hotel doesn t have any other facilities or services like a restaurant which is why i figured i d be getting more room space for the price
