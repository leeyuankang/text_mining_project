hotel undergoing the building of a new wing not that this caused us any issues except signs of building work meant reception was a temporary pop up affair rooms that we had were tired and in need of some love first room had a broken window mechanism and signs of damp with chunks of plaster missing around the window area shower did not drain properly and overflowed after only a couple of minutes we requested another room which we duly transferred too which was better although bathroom lights would work for no longer than minutes before they went out guess a problem with a transformer overloading fault reported but not rectified during our stay the building is magnificent the rooms we had just needed some care and attention and then the hotel would be first rate
