though very convenient for the work conference it wasn t at all convenient for the rest of what we wanted to see in bcn that definitely makes it a tradeoff we picked it partly b c of the rooftop pool thinking that my mom and son could relax and play there while i was at work mtg but the pool was a scene really only for women not fun for a grandmother and teenager the hotel had a lot of generic ads about things to do in bcn they could give more specific info about the beach and how to get to it it took me days to realize where to go to get to the beach the first times i walked out of the conference center i only saw the cement area behind the ccib and thought that s all there was nearby but it wasn t they also could have made a more specific rec about the museu blau which was right across the street and was fabulous
