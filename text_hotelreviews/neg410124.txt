the hotel had a raucous party going on in the garden from until late evening on both evenings of our stay which was also open to non residents to purchase a ticket although guests could attend for nothing we didn t want to and this made the garden inaccessible for us as we just wanted a pleasant early evening drink the bar area was also not conducive for the same reasons hugely disappointing and totally inappropriate for an allegedly four star hotel
