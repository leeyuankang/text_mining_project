we enter the hotel o clock in the night me and my college get a room with double bed that was not the request we come down to sort it out the straff send us to a temporary room and guess what there was a woman sleeping in the room when we entered unacceptable she became angry and we were so embarrased i wanted to leave the hotel immediatly and refund my money the hotel arranged a room on the fifth floor and guess what happened next the shower was not working it felt useless to contact the lobby every minutes i was at this moment super disapointed the next morning we went to explain that i felt disrespected with how everything was going and i had paid a lot of money for nights we got upgraded by the restaurant manager a lovely room with a view fruits and champagne in the room we got access to the excecutive lounge and spa as compensation we were satisfied a couple of hours until we noticed that the room was like a sauna during sleeping time i was exhausted and had no energy to call the staff i have astma so i did not get so much oxygen i could not breathe during the night i just gave up because there was always something that was not working we got compensated with euro discount for massage and late check out even through i am very happy with the manager i am very disappointed with the hotel and the lack of professionalism i feel like i have been robbed on the money i had so much expectations but i had a horrible experience with this hotel it is supposed to be hotel
