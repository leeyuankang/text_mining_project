i have stayed at this hotel annually for the last years and for the most part have always been happy with the service and standards on our latest visit we paid for the upgrade to include the executive lounge which was not very executive at all in fact pretty shocking throughout and very poorly managed it was clear there was no management oversight from an operations perspective and the hotel has clearly cut back on the staffing of this area at one point in the day there were no glasses to pour any drinks into no ice in the ice bucket fridges were poorly stocked up and nothing was faced up or presented well and many of the plates were dirty the toilet door lock was also broken over the two days we were there the place was filthy inside and out with used glasses and food debris everywhere and children were just helping themselves with no supervision which surprised me as technically these children had unsupervised access to alcohol i thought this level was for over there was little or no food available at what you would presume would be a key walk in time like this was repeated in the afternoon and the executive lounge closes far too early in the evening this is the year staying at this hotel and the executive lounge facility was the reason i booked the hotel over other hotels but over the last couple of years it seems to have got progressively worse i thought last year s poor service was a one off but it was poor for the two days i stayed there this year it is the last time i would consider upgrading for the executive lounge in future and may actually not book there at all next year i did complain to reception but there was no attempt whatsoever to recover the service or offer any form of compensation which i thought was a missed opportunity and has cost them a couple of customers as a result the rooms are stayed june vp operations ftse uk company
