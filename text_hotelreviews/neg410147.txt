checking in was delayed for two of the party for well over an hour and no hospitality offered four members of the party were accommodated on time but my friend and myself i organised the trip had to wait in reception until the final check on the room was made by the housekeeper this took over an hour i thought that the offer of a drink of some kind would have been in order
