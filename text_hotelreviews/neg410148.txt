wifi kept disconnecting every few minutes the open concept bathroom was dangerous due to wet floors from having the shower completely open to the rest of the bathroom had to use the few towels provided to mop up the mess so i wouldn t slip and fall the transportation company this hotel contracts with is abysmally incompetent they caused our party so much stress in our attempt to catch our flight they charged for water bottles that were complimentary in our other hotel the rooftop pool was nothing more than a lap pool it certainly didn t have the luxury that the ad portrayed and those are just a few of my dissatisfactions
