overall poor and unfriendly service we used the do not disturb signs for our room to no avail the cleaners still wandered in unannounced there was no soap in some of the public bathrooms they tried to overcharge us for items we did not consume from the minibar there was a taxi strike the day we were due to depart but we were given no warning and when we asked for information regarding public transport available the hotel staff were completely oblivious to what the city could offer us in terms of early morning transportation to the airport as an alternative we ended up walking to the opposite hotel to ask for help the cocktails drinks were overpriced and poor quality
