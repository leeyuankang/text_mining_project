the hotel was a little far out from the centre of barcelona we had to use the underground but this wasn t too much of a problem for us the breakfast also was expensive at per person but they knew people would pay it as there was no places to eat nearby but the breakfast was a big buffet with lots to offer so you got your money s worth
