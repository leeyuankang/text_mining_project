the hotel is far too overpriced the floor lounge is a nice option but the opening time is restricted from the spa area is not exceptional it offers a small heated pool a sauna and a hammam that was not well heated the room prices are exaggerated for what the hotel offers there was a strange smell in the bathroom all the time
