the daily cleaning of the room was pretty poor we did not have the toilet paper replaced for days and ran out the coffee sachets also were not replaced once used as there are no bed side tables a glass got knocked over in the middle of the night by a pillow and it wasn t replaced at all during our stay other glasses where not cleaned on some days the bathroom and bedroom is separated by a glass window with a blind you can pull down however you can still completely see through the blind
