the staff were tired and not very helpful stressed and no smiles the hotel looks good but closer inspection the small things are not being looked at i was in the standard rooms which looked right out to a new building site and the noise was intense higher floors are more money and was told they were fully booked out which can happen in fairness but not one thing was complemented for with these conditions as if it was the guests fault for booking waiter staff in the restaurant really slow and unhelpful reception staff were the best of all and the cleaners i stayed before in a suite room two years ago and had a much better experience then then now think it needs a little more love in the workplace
