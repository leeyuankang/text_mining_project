a window between bathroom and room there was a blind one could pull down but you could still easily see to both directions our teenager found this very disturbing thinking their privacy was not guaranteed lighting no light for the desk general lighting dim not possible to turn off the light at the room entrance unless you took out the access card from the reader and thus disabled all the other lights as well poor air conditioning you could have cut the air with a knife in the morning luckily there was a window you could open bathroom floor and shower floor are very slippery even when dry let alone when wet an elderly person would have been in trouble these things would not stop me from selecting this hotel again but are something i would want to improve
