the bed was very comfortable but there was very little space in the room no table very small wardrobe very small luggage rack bathroom extremely small and under equipped the door was semi transparent glass and didn t have a lock no shelf to place one s things shower space had no rim so water flooded the whole bathroom ok if you just want to sleep here but not comfortable if you want to spend any time relaxing
