we had to change the rooms four times before we got a room which did not smell of smoke not quite sure where the smell comes from past smoking rooms badly renovated or prior guests who have smoked or smell from street and or nearby power plant the furniture is quite worn for a four star hotel with very visible signs of past use the bathtub shower was difficult to use because there was basically no space to move if those things don t matter to you it s a very good and comparatively low priced options for the standard and location
