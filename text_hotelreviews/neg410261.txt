some of the staff at front desk do not speak english the wellness area is tiny and messy and not really clean really not worth to book it with the room we booked a suite with spa and these do not have beach view so its not worth neither the breakfast buffet ihas a good selection if food but its also not really clean probably due to the mass of people having breakfast at the same time finally better not to forget any items when leaving the hotel one month after our stay we are still waiting that the hotel returns the item we forgot in our room lets hope
