the breakfast with euro per night and person is a little too expensive sorry but for this price i booked a room without breakfast i never had to pay so much for a breakfast and i dont think that it is necessary to do that it is bad that there is a unfinsihed building next to the hotel and you have a view to that building all the time maybe some people dont want that i ignored it because it does not disturb that much but the view to this building is not sooo beautiful but you can also see the sea and the beautiful streets an palmtrees so all together it is not such a big problem
