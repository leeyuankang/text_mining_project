despite booking otherwise when i arrived despite being a solo traveller and pre requesting a double bed i was given a twin room i was told this was essentially luck of the draw which isn t what i d expect when paying prices and given the option to select double in the booking location is also poor and the staff are unhelpful i wasted about minutes stuck in a lift that didn t seem to want to take me anywhere else but the floor and another half hour or so trying to work out how to turn the numerous lights in my bedroom
