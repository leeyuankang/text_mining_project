bad points the location we found this hotel to be quite abit further out of the centre than its first may seem we had to get the metro underground into the centre each day which took about mins including the walking the metro station is only mins from hotel there is also a tram stop outside hotel but it does not direct to the centre for some reason another bad point about this hotel is the derelict building next to it it looks like another hotel they started to build and gave up after putting up the concrete frame it s not small about stores high and only a about meters from the hotel giving a lot of the rooms a view of a abandoned graffitied concrete building site also the pool area is very small you ll find yourself walking into to an areas crammed with people and not a sun bed of chair in sight if you re lucky you might get one as someone leaves as we did also the bar next to the pool serves limited drinks no daiquiris or cocktails by the pool
