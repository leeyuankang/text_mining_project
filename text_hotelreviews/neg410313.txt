i slept really badly during the first night as i did not realize air conditioning was not automatically on and despite several light switches i could not turn one of the lights off i called to the reception the next evening and a member of staff came to show me how to use the electronic display it did not react to my finger tip but needed a nail or a sharp card to operate from there i could control air conditioning and one of the lights while all other lights could also be operated from traditional light switches breakfast selection was rather poor on my first morning but much better on the two other mornings i stayed
