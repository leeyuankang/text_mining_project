reception staff not attentive spa staff unfriendly and not welcoming to guests spa in general way too hot despite guests complaining no improvement same for the gym i saw several guests complaining about the high temperatures without any action air condition does not work effectively so gym smell at times was really bad did not see any hotel manager unusual which might explain the customer service standards staff is not listening to requests or acting on it there is lack of staff in executive lounge swimming pool rarely saw a person in the executive lounge and if there was someone available they sat in front of the computer and did not attend to guests or clear any of the used plates glasses away staff arrived late for opening of the swimming pool guests waited over despite several guests going down floors with elevator to inform the reception where upon the reception feedback was that the pool was open hotel needs a more organized approach disappointing standard for a supposedly would not re visit spa one of the worst spas visited frequent traveller
