the location is a bit far off from the beach so unless you rent a car or travel by other means it can be annoying walking or so to reach the first beach the coolest beach are in my opiniln bogatell nuova icaria and the first one after the barcelona casino also thats were majority of clubs are no shops on the beach so buy your slippers and beach swiming suit in advance also consider takkng s beach towel aswell unless you want to rent it for per day depending ln the beach you go this is nothing to do with the hotel but with the experince be prepared to wait until to get into your room check in is very slow due to busy season and lack of more cleaning stuff i guess so if you get there early is nice to do something instead of waiting cuz you will hotel location is far from any attraction or place of interest from barcelona so bear that in mind if you smoke get packs in advance especially on weekens the tobacco shops are closed and the bar that have cigarette offer a small range of choice nothing else enjoy your stay barcelona is amazing
