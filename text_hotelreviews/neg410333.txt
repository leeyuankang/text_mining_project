they did not have the room that i had booked granted that they upgraded me but it was a smokers room and it was reeking with tobacco absolutely disgusting when i complained and demanded a non smoking room like i had reserved they gave me the run around for hours by ignoring my many calls to the reception in both person and by phone at that price an absolute disgrace
