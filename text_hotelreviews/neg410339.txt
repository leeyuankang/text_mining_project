the bedroom was outdated and lots of things were broken in the room i e cupboards wardrobe bed light touch system to control heating etc the toilet had no door the rooftop pool was very disappointing much smaller than what it looked on the photos and it was completely crowded also the jets were not working definitely not the tranquil image of what we anticipated the hotel is located next to a building site the staff took a long time to help you at the check in desk we thought we were getting breakfast as advised but unfortunately we didn t receive this due to a last minute change that was also ludicrously expensive euros each per day crucially i felt ripped off in paying so much money for this hotel i have stayed in far better hotels and paid far less don t be drawn in by the pictures and keep looking for something better location is very east of barcelona
