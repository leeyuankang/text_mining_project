bathroom was horribly designed the shower is just in the middle of the room there s a curtain but no delineation on the floor so water gets everywhere you can t reuse towels because you have to leave them all over the floor so you don t slip on the wet floor afterward the sink is tiny so you also end up with water on the floor after washing your face i ve stayed in cheaper tinier hotels in london that at least had a standard bathroom this looks like someone designed it to look cool but not be used by anyone
