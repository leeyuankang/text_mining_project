some of the staff are too arrogant and neither helpful nor available they gave us an itching smoke smelly room and blamed it on us even looking that we were travelling with a baby they woke us up by mistake at am on the night we had the discussion about the smoky bedroom the automatic lights seem fancy but not working after complaining again in the morning things got slightly better not a good experience at all and not even close for the money you pay for the restaurant was way too expensive for barcelona prices and took long for them to explain me the final bill they could not tell what was coming from the bar and what from the restaurant no way this hotel can be voted as the best as they claim it was a definitely a bad experience
