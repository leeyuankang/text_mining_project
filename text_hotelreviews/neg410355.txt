unfortunately the girls on the desk were distracted and weren t very helpful when we arrived they told us the nearest beach was to be reached by going to barcoleneta metro station and then walking from there we were very disappointed as we had looked forward to a walk by the sea and a swim this meant we spent all our time getting metros into the city for everything on the last day when i asked again about getting to the beach a different staff member told us it was a minute walk we couldn t believe it that wrong information when we first arrived really had a bad impact on our visit we were also told there wasn t really anywhere to eat nearby which also wasn t true we discovered we also found that we could have walked along the beach into barcelona which we would have loved to have done please make sure that your staff know the local area and take the time to give good correct information on the whole though the staff were wonderful
