our room telephone didn t work and the staff didn t think to change our room to a different one after realizing this which meant any requests for room service meant i needed to leave my room and go downstairs to order all of the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful except for the host employee who worked in the executive lounge who seemed to hate her job and the guests of the hotel
