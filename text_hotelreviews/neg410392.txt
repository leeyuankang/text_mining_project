whilst the staff were friendly they weren t very attentive the executive lounge has gone downhill not stocked up and poorly managed cleanliness was poor for the duration of the stay in fact we actually cleaned up ourselves at one point room was nice lifts were quick no wifi in executive lounge which is not good this has been a problem for years and still not rectified management have clearly cut back on staffing and are neglecting this area and need to refocus attention if they want people to pay the uplift to be fair it is a nice hotel and we stay every year and will do again we just felt on this occasion it didn t meet up to our expectations and there usual good standards
