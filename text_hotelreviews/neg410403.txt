i didn t think this hotel offered good value for money you didn t get your bedlinen changed unless you request it or kettle and teaspoons only enough milk to make coffee or tea per day and the toilet tissue was of very bad quality they might be saving themselves a few cents per day with that practice but it is irritating when you pay that sort of money for a hotel room the use of the spa facilities is not included but apparently this is common practice in spa hotels in spain
