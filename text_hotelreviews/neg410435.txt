booking com is more crap then the hotel i was shown a hot tub bed room at the point of sale on booking com website though was given completly poor quality basic room when i asked for the same room was told have to pay x more hence make sure you are not booking this hotel only because of an eye catching room picture shown on the booking com we could not use the pool as it was cold we were told it never heats up until june the cleaner took my night cloths which i couldnt recover and no one could tell me where they were the place is too far from the town hence taxi is trip to the town if you are landing at bcn airport its other end of the city hence each trip breakfast was good though very expensive i would never recomend using booking com and this hotel to anyone
