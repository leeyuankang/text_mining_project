only the executive rooms and the suite with hot tub s have sea view the rest of the rooms are located on lower levels and therefore you will have either a nice view over the street or you will have a bad view to an ugly tall building so no sea view for deluxe rooms the rooms are absolutely not soundproof we could hear everything literally everything which were happening in the corridor our neighbors bathroom both beside and upper floor and so on so be aware that the sentence which they put in the hotel introduction is just a joke rooms are not soundproof the hotel is also a bit far from the city center and you have to put around minutes by tram metro to reach the city center beside these negative points the rest was good we a young couple came to barcelona for relaxation we decided to pick this hotel which is one of the most expensive hotels in barcelona according to booking com because it offered sea view totally soundproof rooms floor lounge and you can imagine how much we pissed off once we got none of them the floor lounge is not accessible for guests of the deluxe rooms only for guests of executive rooms and suite with hot tub the outside bar was completely closed during our stay
