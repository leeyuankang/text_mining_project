the cleanliness was not as i excepted we told the reception about a lot of foundation on the hairdryer and they promise to clean this but after we told them this it was still there so my daugther clean it by herslef we want to use the spa area and before we want to use it we will check it out and ask about if we should bring towel from our room or if we will get some towel there but the girl in the spa reception was more interested in speaking with her colleague than her customer so after we have waited in nearly min we skip our plans about using the spa area which was include in our room but without treatment of course i will think twice before i will chose this hotel again
