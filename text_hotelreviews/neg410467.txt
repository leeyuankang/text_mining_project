temperature of the bathing water is difficult to adjust the bathing water is slow and weak when i stayed in this hotel last year the reception staff helped me to get a taxi to airport but this year the staff refused to get a taxi for me she asked us to get it ourselves outside the hotel in fact one of the staff had promised to help us the night before the check out day the staff should be more helpful to customers who do not speak spanish because many taxi drivers do not speak english we wanted a taxi big enough for people and big luggages however we had some difficulty to make the taxi driver to understand us until a passer by came to help
