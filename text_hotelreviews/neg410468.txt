although tea coffee making facilities were announced in the room there was no kettle i assume the guests were supposed to boil water in microwave which is somewhat weird there were tea bags only for one room no refill tea mugs were good though i did not like the view to the construction site fortunately construction is suspended and at least it did generate any noise
