the service is not rude but half of the staff just don t care room door didn t close without a push my room door was left open after the cleaning lady shower tap was broken either freezing cold or boiling hot toilet ring wet after cleaning irritating noisy control panel in the wall luckily the even more noise microwave oven could be disconnected etc good if not great hotel ruined by small design flaws and staff not caring about the jobs they do
