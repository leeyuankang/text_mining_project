we got approached by people asking us for money on the first evening we arrived back at hotel early evening made us feel quite unsafe certainly wouldn t want to get to the hotel late in the evening also it did feel a bit like people who booked directly with the hotel rather than through a book site were given preferential treatment i would have booked through the hotel but it was alot more expensive our view from our hotel room was basically straight on to a building site we were out and about alot so not too much of a problem for us but i can see some people would not be happy with this
