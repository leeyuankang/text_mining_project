the staff on check in we re incredibly rude we were told that as we had booked through booking com they didn t receive the request for a double room a cot bed for our daughter and that it s up to us of we wanted to cancel as it doesn t cost them anything the swimming pool is small and it s not heated so it s not suitable for children the rooms and hallways sometimes smelt like someone had been smoking the unfinished abandoned construction site next door is a bit nasty but i guess that s not their fault
