the spa lacked luxury although i did have a very good massage the room decor was depressing the shower broke and they products were similar to those you d find in a public toilet the corridors of the hotel smelled like an old peoples home also i left a pair of sunglasses and swimming costume in there i know exactly where i had left them and when i can to retrieve they d gone we won t be coming back the room was naff it s a business hotel i get that but in this day and age you don t need a giant desk in the middle of the room
