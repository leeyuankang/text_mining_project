the first room zi was given had no window i was not told this and being somewhat claustrophobic was dreading the stay there however the young lady at the desk later asked me if the room was alright and i was able to tell her that i hated the room i was given a room with a window right away when zi returned to the hotel days later from zparos i was given a lovely room with a window onto the nun road without hesitation i was also grateful that i could leave my suitcase at the hotel while visiting family in paris i think that the closeness to the wonderful st pancras station is a wonderful asset
