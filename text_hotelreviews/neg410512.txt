the staff are so unresponsive whatever you ask them the answer is no we were given a room with faulty ac in the hot and humid barcelona these kind of accidents are normal although it should have been checked before our check in after we reported they said we cannot fix it now and you can change your room but it took nearly hour from midnight to am for them to service the new room and to give us a new key which was frustrating because you re tired and it is in am you ve paid almost euros and you have to stand and wait in the hot room for an hour it was completely unreasonable to me that they didnt have any room available in the entire big hotel and the reception even did not say any one sorry to us after all i was given a bed with a live small cockroach on my bed sheet
