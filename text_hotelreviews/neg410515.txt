it was absolutely appalling the hotel clearly tries to portray itself as a luxury hotel and in comparison to many hotels in barcelona it is expensive however it is not worth the money at all on check in we were shown to what was supposed to be a superior room we found an enormous cockroach in the bathroom a hole in the hotel room wall and cigerette burns in the pillows obviously we were horrified and complained eventually we were moved to a suite and told this would be free of charge but on departure were made to pay by an extremely rude member of staff had we not been told that the room would be complementary we would have checked out on day one as the hotel really was awful the thought of the cockroach meant we couldn t enjoy the breakfasts etc and even the suite was very run down and drab i ve never felt compelled to review a hotel before however this place is diabolical and it would be a shame for anyone else to have the same experience
