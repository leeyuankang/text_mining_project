for the first night we were put in room which was on the laneway from la rambla to placa reial we basically didn t sleep a wink due to the unbearable noise of foot and vehicle traffic yelling shouting banging crashing our request for a change of rooms to a quiter one was readily met with staff apologies the second room was higher up and faced placa reial and we had a very restful second night i suggest that windows doors with double triple glazing are required on the rooms on the laneway my low rating for comfort was due to our initial room experience
