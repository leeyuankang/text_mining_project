wi fi was down for both the days that i stayed there only available at reception and in the lobby area as well as in the terrace it was a bit of an annoyance as i would have to come down to the lobby area just to get some work done or to contact someone i was going to see that day would have made the stay a if not for this other than that beautiful hotel i will definitely come back for my reial star experience since i am a fair individual and saw how spectacular the hotel really is
