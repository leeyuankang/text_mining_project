i had a extremely tiny room but that was not the worst issue it had a window that faced a wall so there was hardly any natural light if you opened it you had all the smells from the kitchen getting in the room but the worst bit was the fact that the isolation of the room was very poor right next to a noisy elevator that was used most of the night i could also hear the people in the corridor or on the floor above not acceptable for a hotel in total the value for money was very poor
