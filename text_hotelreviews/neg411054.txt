check in can be a wait they say but i heard people were still waiting for their rooms at i waited a couple of hours but it was ready by so i cannot complain value for money is questionable especially on the breakfast i believe euros per person for the buffet is a bit over the top staff professionalism could be improved although they do have to put up with some rude clientele which is often unnecessary the staff seemed quite stretched low on numbers in the outside areas obtaining a sun bed can be very difficult people arrive early to put towels on the sun beds and then disappear for a couple of hours i think the staff should monitor this more closely and remove the towels after a curtain amount of time
