the restaurants in the hotel were frequently booked out for private events we occupied rooms for a week and could only book one lunch at bravo restaurants we were met with a very unfriendly staff at bravo the only unfriendly place in the hotel who just cut us of it s fully booked they never tried to suggest alternatives totally uninterested one should have been informed when checking in that it was necessary to book the restaurant as soon as you arrived the hotel should also always have a a few tables for the hotel guests otherwise it becomes a very different visit at w hotel they are marketing the hotel showing nice restaurants and then you cannot get in and need to go outside the hotel where you only have two often fully booked restaurants nearby
