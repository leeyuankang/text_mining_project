would not waste your money at this hotel after staying in other w hotels before this holiday was an utter disappointment terribly rude and unaccommodating staff as well as being very understaffed did not help the situation rooms that weren t being cleaned the lack of any available beds at the pool beach area for their own hotel guests the old and broken pool beach side furniture that blew away broke every day the hundreds of conference attendees wandering around the small pool area making for a very uncomfortable and disgusting stay all in all no relaxation whatsoever
