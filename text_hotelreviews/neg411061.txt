everything else the staff and service were terrible the food at the wet bar is mediocre the service is unprofessional they re always rushed so orders are botched and forgotten the reception was the worse part with a very unfriendly greeting we had issues with our fully prepaid reservation and thus had to wait to sort it out and were never offered a drink of water although its july also there was a taxi strike upon our arrival in barcelona and this five star hotel was incapable of helping us find transport to it the rooms lack luster and are in need of refurbishing because the shower leaks into the bathroom and there is water everywhere this hotel is not worthy of its five stars period i say this having stayed at other w hotels such as the one in the maldives incomparable there are obvious and grave management issues here
