the staff is unfortunately terrible the hotel was booked and we would get the food drink orders that we gave at least hours later although we wanted a king size bed we had queen size beds in the room the changing rooms that the hotel gave us before the room was ready was terrible and dirty f rst day we had to go around the pool for over minutes to find a bed to sunbath the next morning we have to get up very early in order to reserve a place for the money that we pay we should not struggle with the avaiable spots both in the beach as well as the pool area last day after the check out we have been told that there was a line of taxis avaiable at the entrance but there was a huge que for the taxis and we could not get any generally only good things about the hotel was the beverages manager in pool area maribel who was very helpful to quicken things and the room was clean it was a disappointing experience
