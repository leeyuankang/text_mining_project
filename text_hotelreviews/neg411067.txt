the service in the restaurant at breakkfast was appalling i lost count how many times we had to ask for a pot of hot water for the tea and then forgot to bring milk by the time the milk came the hot water was cold then they attempted to replace the hot water the tea pot went but failed to come back so no tea very busy round the pool area no space for residents residents only pool was totally in the shade in the afternoon tried to ask to move sun loungers was point blankly refused service was slow for drinks
