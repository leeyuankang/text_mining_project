myself and several friends friends of friends were in barcelona for sonar festival and my birthday saturday june in total there were well over separate room bookings with the w for nights with thousands spent and yet it felt like we were paying for the look feel of the hotel but not much more service was lazy and extremely slow drinks would take minutes to be received food orders even longer and the overall quality of the food was below par drinks were great staff were on the whole friendly and majority helpful but the hotel for me was a huge let down other than a free cocktail i received no special treatments for my birthday and it just felt like a huge disappointment deep tissue massages were minutes of being creamed by complete amateurs and had we not of used the jacuzi after would nto have even been worthwhile plus extremely overcharged for this the lifts were always slow and when the nightclub upstairs would be open the queues were a huge inconvenience in the main lobby plus the club was far too full of people crammed in like cattle with nowhere to dance or sit pool was tiny more a show pool than actual enjoyment and always busy with people so could not be enjoyed just rubbish
