took one hour just to check in as short staffed and busy weekend we booked a cosy room through booking com when we got there staff told us that the cozy rooms are on the first second floor which wasnt clear on the website which defeated the point as we wanted to stay in a room that was higher up and in the main tower with a better view after much discussion they upgraded us to the floor in a twin family room when we specifically requested a double the room was only available at about so they made us wait an hour they told us each twin was more than queen sized which didnt seem to be the case the family room was connected to another room with a very noisy family
