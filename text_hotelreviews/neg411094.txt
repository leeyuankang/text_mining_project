work was going on in hotel at our time of stay was trying to have an afternoon nap after early flight but difficult with building work drilling banging was offered a change of room to lower floor but i was too tired to pack move unpack offered breakfast as compliment due to disturbance for mornings only went first morning disappointed with breakfast so ate elsewhere morning if we had paid to have breakfast included it would of cost each per day i only had coffee orange juice couple of slices of ham cheese my partner left half of his cooked breakfast huge let down day pool had been drained a few foot due to work being done around pool area half of pool seating area was blocked off to hotel guests for conference meetings half of decking area you could not sit around sun was in area which was reserved for conference area also noticed our day waiters waitresses seemed to favour the more upper class elite guests for table service around the pool area we had to go to the bar for our own drinks but eventually did manage to catch a passing waiter who brought us a drinks menu so we could order when you go away to a nice luxury hotel you want to be able to relax not possible with workmen around restricted areas top sun deck was closed off due to maintenance works so we spent time away from trying to relax at hotel for what we payed for our stay it was not worth the money disappointed as was a short honeymoon stay if we return to barcelona i would not stay at w again unfortunately
