for a hotel in this price range there was definitely not enough attention to detail like we only got one small shampoo shower gel per day even though we were two in the room one of the cupboard doors hinges was broken loose and door did not properly close has been like that for quite a while apparently the door stop was taken apart on the second day its parts were lying on the floor until we left
