prior to our trip contacted hotel to check if both pools and pool bar are open we were told yes once there infinity pool closed due to the painting of the deck other pool open but bar closed hence slow drinks and lunch service also on our second day as we were sunbathing and enjoying sunshine when asked to leave pool as very important corporate guests had to use it for an event i guess we weren t that important also couldn t use w lounge for lunch advised we can use spa not free or go have lunch in the eclypse which is closed dark club instead of being sat by the pool enjoying sunshine left hotel and went to the beach restaurant for lunch
