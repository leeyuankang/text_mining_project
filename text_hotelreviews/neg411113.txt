i didn t spend much time in the room but if i had to it would ve been boring as you only have a few hours of free radio after that you have to pay quite expensive as well i thought that s ridiculous to be charged for radio also limited free wi fi there is no window you can open so at some stage i felt quite claustrophobic i wasn t impressed with the food either i wouldn t recommend their eggs benedict
