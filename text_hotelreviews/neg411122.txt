i used booking to book a room with a double bed but when i arrived to the hotel they told me that there were not rooms of this type left and that they could only give me one with two twin beds they informed me that the problem was that thru booking the type of beds selected are not confirmed and that i should use directly their website next time concerning the cleanliness i moved a bench that was next to the window for getting closer to the views and there was some garbage under it the floor was very dirty
