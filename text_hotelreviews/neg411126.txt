some of the counter staff weren t too helpful they kept on telling us to take a taxi to wherever we wanted to go however there was this lady named melinda who did her best to help us find our way and to understand the transport system we saved quite a fair bit of money taking the train to the different places instead of a taxi the train system is efficient and there is really no reason why one had to go everywhere only by taxi unless time is not on one s side
