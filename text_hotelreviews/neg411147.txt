it was hit and miss with the staff were fantastic they went out of their way to help and we re very friendly unfortunately half of the staff we met were the opposite these staff need updated customer service training they acted self important and aloof the type you get in designer clothing stores who believe they designed the bag themselves for such a high quality hotel the service should be impeccable of the time
