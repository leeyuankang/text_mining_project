the location is quite far from the city and not easily accessible the personal from the hotel was quite rude and always in a hurry special note to be made to the unbelievable rude manager of the security who treated us like animals when entered the eclipse bar we booked a king size bed but we have been told that was a failure on booking com and the king size does not exist in the type of room we chose so we were offered a king size bed in a more expensive room with a euro extra charge the bathroom is terrible there is mold on the shower ceiling and the wc usage was a bit odd we were a couple and found it very strange to use the glass wc overall you would expect more for the money you pay especially the cleanliness should not be discussed at this level
