we were on honeymoon but we were given a twin which is apparently something to do with booking with booking com so we had sepetate beds girl on reception could have tried harder to get us an alternative we were given a room with an adjoining door and on our last night there was a party next door so we had no sleep hotel gave us some compensation but it wasn t the honeymoon we had hoped for for nearly a night
