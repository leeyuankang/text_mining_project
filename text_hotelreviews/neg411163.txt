service was mixed which i didn t expect for a hotel of this standard instances of poor service included no towels in the room one evening no towels in the downstairs changing area and took to retrieve some following numerous requests and awful management of the taxi queue when trying to catch our flight lots of employees hanging around with relatively little interest in being of assistance toilet shower was only separated from the wider room by glazed window with no sound protection walk to the metro so not great for exploring barcelona
