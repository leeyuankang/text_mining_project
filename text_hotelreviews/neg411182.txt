breakfast could use more variety and also had a lot of flies or top of the fruits hearing alot about the w i imagined the pool will be huge and amazing it was lower the average i dont recommend this hotel for families at night it is very very loud with parties downstairs even the lobby is too loud to walk in with a sleeping baby the beach outside is nice but its a nude beach again its not family friendly
