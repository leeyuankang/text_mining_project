everything first of all when you pay that kind of money per night you expect the service to be impeccable it is far from that you have the impression of being in a disco club all the time the property is dirty the floors are filled with empty beer bottles and cigarettes the staf is extremely arrogant and not at all customer minded most of the people present in the hotel are not hotel guests they come for the party and swimming pool when u want to go to your room since half of the elevators are used by the club going customers there is always a annoying long waiting line the food is bad the water of the swimming pool is dirty you font want to go in there unless you don t care for diseases i hated it and will never in my life go back there
