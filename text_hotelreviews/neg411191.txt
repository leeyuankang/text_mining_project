the meal we were served in room service was awful the fries were dry and cold and may have been a couple of days old the entertainment system was not what i would have expected for a start hotel not sure about the layout of the bathroom complete glass front meant a lack of privacy and you have to have a towel on the floor in your room as the shower opens directly into the room
