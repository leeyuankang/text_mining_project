bathrooms were terrible no water pressure and need an engineering degree to use shower and we are constant travellers in europe we requested double bed but not available even though we booked months ago requested beach views but given view of the construction site this is a business hotel not designed for a vacation located too far from the city and requires a taxi to see any action the w is too expensive unless you have a totally great experience the las arenas resort in valencia a level above this hotel go there first
