communication on arrival due to a friend unable to go due to father having a heart attack the day before so i telephoned bookings com and the hotel to notify to see if we could reduce the rate so my friends didn t have to pay for the extra bed on arrival at the hotel the front deck receptionist didn t understand our request not to have the third bed in the room but all he kept saying was we have to pay taxes we had to have confirmation from bookings com to say we didn t have the third bed i then had to ring bookings com to confirm and remove the bed from our room before they would do anything and bookings com asked to speak to the receptionist he then explained that reservations were going to confirm and not charge us for the third bed on arrival to our rooms which wasn t ready til our cases were not there and both rooms we had booked had the third bed in so when we came to check out we were charged fully for people instead of to which i know it was short notice but under the circumstances we asked not to put a third bed in one of the rooms so in all of us had to pay for the person very expensive the hotel had a nightclub to which we accessed on departing the nightclub we were followed by a male to our hotel room he had got in the lift with us from the nightclub and got out on our floor and followed us right to our door fortunately we are strong and capable ladies and was able to push him back to the lift my friend notified reception but nothing happened i felt this was a serious security breach and needs rectifying immediately if people are leaving the night club the need escorting away from the lift all in all a good weekend but very expensive
