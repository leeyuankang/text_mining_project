the rooms are very small and not ergonomically designed so it was not very comfortable the hotel is like loud and lousy so u don t feel acquainted or resting too many conferences guests security was not top ordered in room dinning last day ravioli with ricotta cheese next day i was with food poison spent time at medical center indeed i reported it to the hotel and they did not charge us the food fees also they mentioned that they will investigate which i appreciate in the end i think it is price is over what you get for value i will not stay again in w but others which are much calmer and dissent
