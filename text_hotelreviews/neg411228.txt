the hotel allows non residents to pay to use the facilities which included stag parties it is basically a conference hotel so as individual travellers we felt pretty unimportant particularly when the deck area we preferred was closed off for a private function on days our room was not serviced when we returned at the end of the day overall not the experience we expected for the star price we were paying
