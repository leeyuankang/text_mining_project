not enough staff they kept forgetting our orders or getting them wrong commenting only on the staff we encountered bearing in mind hundreds work at the w half of the staff were professional others were damn right rude including one manager such a shame because these ones really let the other more concientous staff down no tea making facilities in the room we had to request every day and even then only one tea bag each poor for a five star at expensive prices room a bit tired looking service has gone downhill since our stay in may april not so good
