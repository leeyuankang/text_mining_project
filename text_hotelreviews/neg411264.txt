when comparing the breakfast buffet to some other european countries at start hotels i would say this is average there aren t too many healthy options and the fruit selection is very limited the value is not there for the euro price per person breakfast the staff at the front desk and the concierge were very friendly and helpful there is a club at the top of the hotel called eclipse it is very trendy and is open to the public guests do not need to wait in line however when i am paying almost night for an night stay at a w hotel i expect to be treated as a guest and not as a person off the street having to deal with bouncers and security that takes away from the star guest appeal i must say that i had an issue with them and discussed it with management instead of sucking it up and giving me the customer is always right treatment they gave me a series of excuses while apologizing i don t want to hear excuses training is required and the w really needs to focus on standardizing the guest experience across the board at all of their hotels my personal preference when traveling is to have a great spa to relax in after walking all day or working out the spa is non existent they have a bliss spa and it is very limited so it all depends what your expectations are and mine are pretty high since i have to travel for work all the time and really want a different experience when traveling for leisure
