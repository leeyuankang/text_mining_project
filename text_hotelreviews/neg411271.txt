on our first night at the wave restaurant they gave us rock hard cold bread and only after we asked for it to be changed did they give us soft warm bread there was such a difference so it made us question why it was given to us in the first place the service was slow as well they took a while to take our drinks order after returning to the room from a long day out we came back to find our room remained uncleaned
