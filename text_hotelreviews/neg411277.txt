breakfast is very expensive and not included the bathroom is inside the room a square area in the middle of the room separated by a simple glass with no acoustic isolation which is very embarassing the hotel has towers one short with few floors called the cube and the tallest one with nice ocean and city view i have booked the room many months in advance asking for a high floor i was given a floor room because they said i had booked through booking com which didn t allow me choose it i got a higher floor room with better view only in the other day after complaining a lot restaurant in the pool area is not good expensive and bad food it was a shame they didn t replace amenities in the bathroom everyday we had to use the same soap to take shower and wash hands
