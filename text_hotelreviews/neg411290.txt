we re disappointed with how unexciting everything is from boring colours and furnishings in the room to rather depressing sitting area at the entrance tv is tiny restaurant atmosphere is cold not to mention the overpriced everything overall happy to have tried it since we live in barcelona and wanted to try it for a special day but not staying again there are much more stylish hotels in barcelona in better areas
