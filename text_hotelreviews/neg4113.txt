bathroom facilities very small and cramped not really suitable for my pregnant wife so larger people would have been very uncomfortable room a little dated and check in was slow due to roads being closed around bloomsbury square car park the hotels suggestion and discounted offer the car park was only accessible by one road which neither the hotel staff or police could direct to mins later we found it was only a short walk so could be better on other days
