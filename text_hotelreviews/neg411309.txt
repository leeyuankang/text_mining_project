i have rated the staff highly because i presume this wasn t their fault policy but when i checked in i was asked for a credit card for extras eg mini bar restaurant which was approved and then half way through my stay a pay for movie was declined and i was told there was a problem with my credit card it turned out that they had tried to charge something on my card in sterling which was declined i had a caxton card with only euros on it i was in spain and aren t they only supposed to charge at the end of your stay and then i was told that i had reached my limit and had to approve a higher limit nobody told me i had a limit in the first place this meant i spent my saturday night at reception feeling defensive about my declined credit card
