i booked king size bed and got twin room even though i was travelling solo stuff didn t help with the issue and i had to stay in twin room the view was supposed to be seaview but given that it was floor the view was mainly the huge concrete square under the windows with sea at the back again misleading room description crowd is very tacky especially at the eclipse bar upstairs room was nice but very weathered stinky shower sink area need to be refurbished clearly lack of stuff to deal with requests from rooms asked for water and had to wait for hour for someone to bring it location on the beach is nice but that area of the beach is very dirty and the walk from hotel to city center takes ages and is not very pleasant as area around hotel is quite poor and dirty had to take taxi everytime to save myself walk to the city center also it would be nice if they could remove all the tons of unhealthy sugary and overpriced snacks that they put in the minibar and put something more conducive to healthy lifestyle like fruits and yogurt
