the layout of the room was terrible the basin is in the bedroom not the bathroom and is very inconvenient the hairdryer is located in a corner and awkward to use easily there is also a lack of storage space both days we were there our room was not cleaned until at least and we had been out from immediately after breakfast this meant we had to sit in a communal area until it had been done
