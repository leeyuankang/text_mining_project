it would have been nice to have an outside space as part of the restaurant so that on good weather days you could enjoy breakfast or dinner outside as it did rain during our stay it would of been handy if the terrace had some form of roof so that you could still enjoy the benefits of the hot tub and outside seating area on the balcony during the showers
