rooms incredibly small no storage we had to live out of suitcases and could barely move around and we had a superior room with terace bad layout good for or nights maximum very plane room no counter space and the sink is outside the bathroom weird no concierge front desk staff good for simple direction but not very knowledgeable on the destination so good luck finding restaurants
