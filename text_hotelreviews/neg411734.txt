one thing that could be changed is possibly have a kettle in the room also the roof terrace to be open till later at night would be nice we had one bad experience in a restraunt which i highly recommend not going to as its over priced and awful this restaurant was the do boutique hotel and restaurant in a historic square off the la rambla to give you a clue the warm meal i ordered for was four pieces of asparagus with some ham on top with three dollops of mayo not a meal when complained staff were very rude and said would call the police due to the fact they also wanted to charge my boyfriend euro for a squished sausage and brought the wrong drinks as well
