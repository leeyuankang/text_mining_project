there is an extreme lack of storage space dresses and trouser cannot hang properly because of the location of the safe the glassed in toilet is inappropriate and the wash hand basin in the room rather than in the toilet is unhygienic one teabag per day is unacceptable the entry doors both from the street and from the hallway into reception are very tall and extremely heavy and difficult to open the roof terrace while lovely was very small and the plunge pool far too small and shallow all in all i would not rebook this hotel
