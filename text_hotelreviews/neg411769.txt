we were upgraded to a bigger room if we joined the club which we did well i would have hated to see the smaller room our room was very clean and very comfortable but oh so small for nights and the terrace has no privacy whatsoever due to being separated by others with just a blind so we never used it we also hired a car to get us to and from the grand prix well that was a bad idea as the hotel has no parking facilities and it makes this very clear but the local car parks are very very expensive for an overnight stay and you have no other option
