as others have said the sink in the bedroom is a bit awkward and the rooms are cleaned really too late we returned to our room at and it still wasn t made and wasn t prepared until after we had hoped for a shower and nap before an evening concert but it wasn t possible the staff did apologize and sent us a bottle of cava also we found the breakfast staff not as friendly and helpful and a bit on the rude side but overall i would stay here again
