the buffet breakfast was the single worst hot buffet i ve ever had plates were dirty with dried on food and when told about this the guy behind the buffet just gave me another plate also dirty with no apology sausages only cooked on one side congealed beans hash browns literally dripping grease such a shame as the dining room could be an asset to an otherwise decent and historic hotel
