the only problem i faced was a concierge attendant who was a little bit unfriendly with me as far as i have asked to organize a transfer for me and he behaved as it was not really his business i don t remember his name however he served on saturday in the evening additionally during my first day of staying at the hotel i have found somebody s hair in my bathroom right after checking in the room anyway these factors didn t spoil my stay at all
