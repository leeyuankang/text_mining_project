despite being described on the website as air conditioned the room was not air conditioned they did move me to a different room which although not air conditioned was cooler the d cor was shabby and the carpets were worn particularly on the upper levels on checking in they required me to sign a permission which allowed them to withhold from my bank account for nights the price of the room and an extra on top of the bill in case i had anything extra this was most unexpected and not at all evident at the time of booking or on their website to top it all they charged me an extra which i only discovered when i got home and checked my bank account it seems that they charged me for one of the nights that my friend had stayed she was charged for nights instead of nights they said it was because i used my credit card to book the rooms but no one had mentioned it to me i had also made it crystal clear at check in that my friend and i would each pay our separate bills they have promised to refund this amount to me but it was all very stressful and an absolute mess
