our keycards for two rooms both decided to stop working at the same time my parents rang me to say their cards didn t work after having room service in my room i took my card with me and went over to their room and confirmed that their cards didn t let them in anymore i told them to wait in my room so i can ring them to see what s going on but when i tapped my card mine didn t work as well i was wearing shorts and my parents weren t appropriately dressed to go down to reception luckily i had my mobile phone with me and the key cards have their hotel number to ring for help
