we ran into a problem immediately with the bathroom the tub was old too high to get into and out of i am tall and the bottom very slippery and shockingly no bar to hold onto anywhere we complained and the management attended to the problem immediately and installed a bar that was a huge improvement but not a real solution the tub is still too antiquated and inadequate as is the shower the carpeted floor was uneven and not as clean as it should have been the morning we left all the elevators in the hotel had broken down evidently there are no service elevators
