i booked the hyatt queen room for our aniversary weekend away i was offered an upgrade to an executive room which i accepted and paid extra for we were dissapointed with the room especially the view from the window the run down decoration and noisy plumbing the room also lacked a trouser press iron and board english speaking news channel on tv coffee or tea making facilitiies free bottled water and a poorly stocked mini bar the rest of the hotel was ok with the exception that it had no tourist information around we never used the hotel for breakfast so no comment i have travelled all over the world and in my mind this is not worthy of a star hotel more at best hotel is well over priced beware of the bar prices and water from the mini bar is euro for its a great location with local attractions at your toes
