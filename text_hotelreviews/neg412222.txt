rude staff incapable conscience they managed to lost our luggage which we left for safekeeping for hours finally they found it only because i had to go look for it since they left it untagged but it kept getting worse the people at the conscience probably couldn t understand english as there was a problem with the payment they agreed to get paid in cash and then wouldn t accept it the general manager apologized and promised to make it up to us by making our stay memorable needless to say we neither saw or heard from him again it s like the first five star hotel i ve been to where they make the customer feel invisible and irrelevant shame that s all i have to say
