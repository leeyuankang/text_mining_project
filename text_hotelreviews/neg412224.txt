we booked a courtyard side room as it was less expensive and we thought it would be quieter than the street side rooms what a mistake the courtyard houses the hotel s generators and was so noisy it was like sleeping next to a factory it was impossible to open the window and even with the window closed the noise was inescapable the hotel staff were unsympathetic and made no attempt to provide an alternative or to compensate us in any way our room was undistinguished with poor quality toiletries no tea coffee making facilities room service tea is chaged at euros and no complimentary water all in all over priced and certainly not good value for money i would have expected much more from a hotel that calls itself the oldest luxury hotel in paris if you stay here avoid at all costs the courtyard side rooms unless you are hard of hearing
