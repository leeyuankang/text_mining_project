my card was charged before i arrived even though it clearly stated my card was for guarantee only which lead to me taking to many euros as i planned to pay cash the room was not to the standard i expected or reflective off the price i payed it was small no natural light or view majority off the features of the room were tired and needed updating staines on the carpets overall not a nice place to be
