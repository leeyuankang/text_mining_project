the rooms were tired visible signs of wear and tear when you check into a star hotel you don t want any reminders of previous guests the shower hinges were rusty one fell off when i opened the door scratches and marks all over the sink and bathroom drawers and the carpet was pretty scuffed a big problem being on the first floor was the rumble of the train every three minutes very loud also the wifi was beyond terrible and the movies were poor resolution not what i would expect when paying for one film
