two things arriving at the room and finding some sort of cereals vomit looking like thing dropping down my window they did come and cleaned it within less than min though the fountain outside our window which made noise all night i called asking if they could turn it off but they didn t manage to do it basically keeping me awake all night there s also a club next door so if you re more or less sensitive to noise ask for a quiet room on the other end of the hotel
