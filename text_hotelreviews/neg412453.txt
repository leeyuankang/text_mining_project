they gave me a room that did not look anything like in the pictures of my premium room i said this to receptionist and she told me there are no other rooms available so i called booking com they sorted this out and i got a better room still the magical feeling about having a good holiday mood was gone would never recommend to anyone until they train their staff w is much better option and almost same price
