horrible staff they simply ly to you and do not give the booked room suite with a bath becomes normal room without a bath at the terrace it feels like you have to beg for something to drink or eat and horrible loud music until late every night the only exception is the personel at the pool and the spa they are great this was our second time en we will never come back there
