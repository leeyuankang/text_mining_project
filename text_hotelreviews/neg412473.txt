the worst part was that money was stolen from my room the second day of my stay i only exchange a few hundred euros and only those got stolen i didnt put my wallet in the safe and that was the excuse for not recognizing the fact that my money was gone i didnt thought that in a expensive place like this i had to take extreme actions to secure my belongings the main security guy diego was rude and deny the fact that an event like that could happen there but there is always a first time the manager was a little more understanding however they didnt take any responsibility barcelona is city that you can easily get pickpocketed in the metro in the plazas with lots of tourists in fact one morning i woke up and from my room at miramar ive heard lots of commission in the plaza down below some people were running and screaming calling the police the food in the restaurant took more than minutes to arrive and it was only a couple of salads and a plate of nachos
