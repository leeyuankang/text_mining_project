sorry miramar but it has to be repeated and it s what the other reviewers keep mentioning the pool area and lack of sunbeds please listen to your reviewers there is a grassy area there begging for some decking and sunbeds which would be far more comfy for the guests than having to lie on towels on the grass where there were lots of wasps lurking that was my only minus in an otherwise flawless report
