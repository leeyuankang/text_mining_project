we asked for a late checkout on a monday and we were told the hotel was fully booked and they needed all the rooms however we stayed at the hotel until and the hotel didn t seem full at all we had the feeling the answer was quite mechanical the lady who did our check in seemed to be totally uninterested in what we had to say some of the personnel at the restaurant was very attentive though very limited amount of amenities in the bathroom having a l occitane spa i would have expected to have some bath salts or bath oil at the bath just one of each in the shower the furniture in the room was in need of touch ups most of the big double sunbeds at the pool had a reserved sign but nobody was around music was too loud and commercial for the morning pool service only spoke english and not very friendly some personnel should be told to smile
