this is stars hotel so expectations are adequate to this unfortunately the hotel did not meet them the list of shortcomings could be very long but i ll mention the most important untrained staff not speaking english and not capable to answer any questions tragic service restaurant during breakfast or lunch lack of products on breakfast but they pull your plate to finish faster room cleaning lasts forever we were leaving about and coming back at to untidy room after leaving for pool outside the door shuts automatically you can not return unless passing the restaurant in conclusion hotel in need of renewal and with incompetent service which pretends stars curiosity was to block double money on my card which i failed so far to recover definitely avoid this place
