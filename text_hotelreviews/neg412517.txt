i booked a premium room and expected to have a bathtub in the middle of the room just like in the picture but we just got a normal room with a good view i called the reception about this and they told me that a premium room means a room at the front of the hotel unlike what was promised when i booked the room they promised to give us another premium room the next morning there was a huge difference between the two rooms which i don t think is fair for customers who both book a premium room the service was helpful but i wish the whole misunderstanding could have been prefented in the first place
