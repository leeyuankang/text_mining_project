the room we booked was not available for the first night the hotel warned us hours before our plane took off this is not acceptable for such an hotel they couldn t arrange for another room in the same hotel even for a lower standard one they finally find a room in another hotel when we arrived at the hotel the front desk people seem to be unaware of our situation they finally upgraded our room where restroom had no door and offered the breakfast for the morning after again the people in the breakfast room was not aware that we ve been offered the breakfast what a surprising lack of communication for such an hotel
