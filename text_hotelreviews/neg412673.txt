it s a very minor issue our room had a nice rain shower which worked very well but the shower base was a bit slippery and was too flat to effectively drain the water away fast enough water tended to flow under the shower door onto the floor in the area of the toilet the bathroom is sort of open plan and is right in front of you as soon as you enter the room this didn t bother us at all but it is a somewhat strange layout
