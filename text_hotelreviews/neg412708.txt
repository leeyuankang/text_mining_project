the hotel menu was very limited in its choice and not very enticing it was also very expensive drinks both non alcoholic and alcoholic were also very expensive the shower toilet shared a sliding glass door that was very hard to close from inside especially with wet hands there were no handles to use and the glass door was very heavy to move
