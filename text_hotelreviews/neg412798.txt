furniture in common areas look worn lack of storage space for cloths only some open shelves no separate bathroom just a small toilet w a class sliding door which means privacy is quite limited and we didn t like the painted floor in the entrance area or the red wall in the room not cozy and the fluorescent lighting in the room was ridiculous looked more like an operating room in a hospital than a hotel lighting no way to dim these super bright lights cleanliness limited to the basic dust collecting e g on floor lists in room and in common areas difficult to control the room temperature
