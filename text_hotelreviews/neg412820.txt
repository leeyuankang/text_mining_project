the lights in the room are very annoying they are very bright and not well organized the spotlights are exactly toward the pillows and the side light too bright and the three of them switched on with on switch the bathroom has spotlight with one switch there is no way to use one light so at night i use my mobile flash to see my way through because switching on the four spotlights will definitely woke my partner up since bathroom s walls are glass
