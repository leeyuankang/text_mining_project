the walls were so thin i could hear neighbouring guests open and close their closets and drawers i panicked on the first morning because it sounded like they were showering in my bathroom what happened at on monday morning made me feel deeply uncomfortable i would have taken a cold shower but didn t want them to think someone was in their room it s always nice to hear cheery cleaning staff yelling to each other in the hallways though a final oddity there was a distinct lack of plug points so this was the first hotel i ve stayed at in many years where my phone hasn t been within arm s reach as it s charged overnight having to march across the room and turn off my alarm rather than snoozing it for hours was deeply distressing
