i paid a substantially higher rate for a room with a terrace the terrace was a small space with just enough room for two stained sunbeds and was marked by short planters on the sun deck of the pool area the back of the pool bar was at one end of the terrace complete with noises of staff working and bottles being thrown into bins and crates there was no privacy people walked past and could look straight on to the terrace the foliage marked a boundary but did not screen then there was the flicked cigarette incident where i could have been lying on the sunbed at the time and been burnt myself the terrace is a very expensive joke a bottle of water was presented to us on our first night and then that was it despite the room description stating that water would be in the room i shouldn t have had to ask for this to be given daily the bathroom had walk in shower which was badly lit and what i thought was a circular jacuzzi this turned out to be just a bath in a dark space with no direct electric light and a blind covered window as this opened out on to the pool deck for approximately per night i would have expected a higher standard of facilities
