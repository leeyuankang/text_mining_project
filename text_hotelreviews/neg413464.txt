first of all we were given a room at the front part with a beatiful view on the plaza and surroundings however the noice from the taffic was unbearable despite my request at checkin the staff ensured me the room was quite this was a straight lie after i complained the next morning we were give another room at the back with a very poor interior view of the hotel but at least it was quiet and we could sleep well umfortunately we could only occupy that room at make sure they dont put you in one of those city view rooms another inconvenience was that there are as good as no electric outlets to charge your phone and camera and also the beds are not very comfortable small and double beds are made out of two single that move apart as soon as you make a move which i hate
