conditioner was not working was constantly deistracted by staff from the hotel coming into my room while i was preparing for a meeting so for the first night i had to sleep in the classic room instead of executive that i booked second day they manage to fix the conditioner by the evning still i had to insist doing something about it the receptionist on arrival day was not particularly friendly as i expect from it felt like i am bothering him with questions the other staff were ok after all this they offered free breakfast and late chek out but i think they should of made a discount for the first night
