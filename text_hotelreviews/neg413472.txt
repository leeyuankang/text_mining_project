right this is the negative and i ve left writing this review to give the hotel chance to respond from our trip although our room was really lovely there was a really bad drain smell in the bathroom which got progressively worse we reported it every day but nothing was done we had to remember to keep the bedroom door closed as we cudnt sleep because of the smell the first night we couldn t find anywhere to plug the kettle in apart from the bathroom to be fair we kept forgetting to ask but we did search all over for days with no advanced warning after settling ourselves all of us on the bali beds we wer told we had to vacate the area due to some function or other being held there by which time all the beds by the pool bar wer taken leaving us to sit on the floor and apart from each other ok i accept these things happen but to not tell us that this wud be happening the following day as well was very poor customer service what can i say about the bar service except that it was practically non existent they left a poor girl who had absolutely no clue how to use the till what the prices of the drinks were to cope with people on her own it wasn t stocked properly and we waited nearly hours for the most simple of bar meals they didn t even get that right it didn t really improve over the days we wer there what an absolute shambles i think they were more concerned about the guests attending whatever functions they were holding than any of the actual guests staying paying at the hotel the final insult was at check out when asked if everything was ok with our room i mentioned the drain smelll how many times i had reported it and was told that s too bad also they refused to call us seater taxis for the airport so we had to pay for when we only need
