staff very rude not helpfully at all i had two suits that i paid a lot of money for my dads for a surprise and they stunk of the sewers we complained they said nothing we can do about that which i thought was horrendous also didn t clean rooms correctly the window from our bathroom was steamed up so could not sit in our bath to over look our views of barcelona then asked to use spa to freshen up after we had check out they said was fine so later went back to use the shower and refused us to use any of there facilities
