the only issue we had was when we came back on friday evening to a wet floor which appeared to have come from next door we mopped up the water as it had partially dampened our suitcases and then went to bed the next morning it was ok slight amount of water but we did not report it as we didn t want to have to pack up and move rooms photos attached also there is a spread of water coffee apples and macarons by the elevators this was cleared away at a time i was craving an apple ok a macaron so it would be nice to keep the area fresh with fruit at least
