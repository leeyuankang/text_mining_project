when we booked the hotel the main thing we wanted was the air con the hotel is misleading customers because they said the is no air con in the winters time when it is clearly displayed on the website and does not mention that its seasonal we complained about this misleading information the staff said there is nothing we can do at first they also lied that they had no rooms left to upgrade us when we checked on the website mins later there was still rooms available also if you want to use the gym there will be a queue in the whole hotel they only have treadmill bike and elliptical machine anybody reading this review think carefully before booking this hotel for your own money
