i found the staff to be average it took a long time to check in i don t know why as the reception wasn t busy i enquiried about the rooftop bar and was told it wasn t open at this time of year this was fine but another guest informed me that there was a beautiful view of the city from the roof of the avenues next door i was surprised that the receptionist hadn t told me this at one point i went in to reception to ask a question and waited several minutes although there were or staff behind the counter doing different things no major issues but would expect better from a hotel
