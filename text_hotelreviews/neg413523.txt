generally the hotel was not bad the room was clean one main gripe what hotel doesn t allow you to adjust the air con room temperature mentioned this to the reception was advised that as it s winter the cool option on the air conditioning had been switched off for the whole hotel i wouldn t stay here again or any other hotel that s part of this chain if i can t even do the basic things like adjust the temperature in my room or make a cup of tea or coffee
