the room was super cold you need to turn down the a c and provide blankets for people that like cold rooms its great but for me i am very sensitive to the cold so it wasn t good from that point of view also the pillows are not super comfortable the only problem i had was that i needed to stay an additional night and the hotel was overbooked and the prices has changed dramatically i really didn t like that in addition that week i was there all hotels were pretty much booked fully and made it a unpleasant for me to leave in that manner
