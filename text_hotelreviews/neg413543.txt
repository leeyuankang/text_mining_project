we went to the hotel restaurant and they sat us at a table we waited minutes to have someone take our drink orders but nobody came so we left we went back to the room to order room service but nobody answered when we called and even when front desk transeferred when we did get a hold of them and received our meal the meat was undercooked we ordered it medium well so we had to wait longer
