booked a double room we was given a room with two single beds pushed together and made up as single beds identified this as an issue with reception and was informed that the hotel had been over booked and that their was nothing that we could do required to pay on arrival before seeing the room requested that we pay extra for an upgrade this was also not an option so was left dissatisfied with beds that split apart during the night for nights no apologies and acknowledgment from staff for the discomfort unable to have a sunbed around the pool due to not being enough sun loungers for the guests
