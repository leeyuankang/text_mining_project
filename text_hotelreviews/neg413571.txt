the triple room we were allocated was a bit tired and shabby we asked for other room options and the receptionist was really helpful and did not question our criticism of the room we ended up in a refurbished large double room which easily accomated an extra bed for our daughter no extra charge i think the rooms need some tlc so careful which you book nothing too much of an issue but you know how bathrooms get after a lot of use cracked tiles stained sealant etc
