room was non smoking but stunk of cigarettes and the aircon didn t work we also found that people put their towels on the sun beds at and wouldn t return to the pool until midday meaning there was hardly any room by the pool the pool also had a playlist on repeat all day every day with a total of songs made it quite unbearable bar was good and bar staff really friendly but basics like water and coffee were too expensive spa staff were incredibly rude and snappy would not recommend the spa to anyone
