pool area was way to busy no sunbeds free unless you wake up at and screaming kids everywhere in hotel even nice rooftop pool area is filled with kids reception was like a youth club with large school like groups everywhere please also note that only iron exists in hotel had to wait for hour to use room was nice but very dated
