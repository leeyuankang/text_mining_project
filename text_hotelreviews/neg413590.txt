the rooms are pretty small for a stars hotel there are no irons in the room and when you ask for it you can end up waiting which is ridiculous for the stars hotel the buffet for euros could provide more food especially for those who don t eat pork the worse was the bed the blanket are so cheap and itchy and patently there are the only ones there i have been traveling my entire life and i have never seen a star hotel providing those types of blanks it s the kind of brown grayish one the mattresses we had had little bugs inside of them and we all go stung but them it s ridiculous again for a stars hotel when you call the reception most of them don t know what they talking about and they say they will check and call you back and don t i was pretty disappointed by that as well
