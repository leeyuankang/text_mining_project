i requested a room on the upper floors on my booking upon my arrival they said the hotel was full and they couldn t provide me with one until the next day the next day i had the pleasure to speak to the most rude cocky and unpolite recepitionist i have ever met in my life i told her i requested a room change and she said there was nothing she could do about it i told her my room did not have a mini bar and that i needed one as i often drink cold water she said she couldn t give me one i continued by saying i was very disappointed with the service to which she replied and i quote ok needless to say this was the worst experience i had staying at a hotel in spain the rooms do not look like in the picture ours was one facing the inside of the hotel and we barely got any sunlight the bed was extremely uncomfortable there was mold in the bathroom under the soap dispenser and both the tub and sink drains were almost all clogged up terrible just terrible and for all of this they requested we payed in advance i strongly advise everyone to not visit this hotel as they do not care about their guests needs
