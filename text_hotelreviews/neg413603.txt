key cards didn t work on a daily basis had to go up and down to reception numerous times to get the cards reactivated this was annoying as it was nearly every day during our stay reception staff are flappy always seemed a bit stressed out my card was charged incorrectly when we arrived then we were informed that more money was owed when we left due to the staff error at the beginning this all seemed a bit unclear and unprofessional and the lady at reception became quite angry when i asked her to explain what the extra charge was for most of the staff there are polite though room smelt of stale smoke when we arrived asked for a double bed ended up with two singles one higher than the other got woken up on the day of checkout at via telephone to the room and a knock on the door didn t have to leave until midday
