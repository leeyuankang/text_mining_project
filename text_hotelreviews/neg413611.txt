the staff were pleasant enough but not too friendly the woman who checked us in almost charged us too much and when i pointed out that the amount she had put on the card machine was different to that she had showed me on the computer she just said that was the amount with the currency conversion which was obviously incorrect she understood in the end and amended it but didn t apologise for what could have been a massive over charge additionally i exchanged a note for some smaller notes at the reception and the guy gave me a and other notes when i tried to use the note later in the day to pay for the cable car i was told it was counterfeit the woman showed me and compared it to a real note and you could then see it wasn t real i returned to the reception and after minutes of the woman looking for a uv light bulb she asked her manager and they did exchange it for another note and apologised for the error and apparently destroyed the note the pillows on the beds were bit rubbish one of them which was a normal size had a horrible leather like cover on it which none of us could sleep on the other pillow was very small height wise so it wasn t that comfy prices for drinks at the rooftop bar were a little pricey although i guess this can be expected due to the hotel location a little far from the beach sagrada familia las ramblas but only about taxi to all of them there is a metro station right outside the hotel but we didn t use this
