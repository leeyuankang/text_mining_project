unfortunately my plane was delayed by two hour because of thunder storms so i arrived at my checkin was an absolute disaster the reloje suite that i had booked and was confirmed to me via booking s reservation confirmation was given to an other client who had reserved a family suite that was give to me afterwards since the people did not like their family room the front desk manager lucy at reception took on her to give my room away all though confirmed to me to an other guest i had specially booked the reloje suite because i needed to have a table for for meetings since i had interviews and meetings on top of that i travel with a lot of it for work so i need space when i arrived for check in at the receptionist tatiana checked me in seemed trobled when asked her if there was a problem she said management had decided not to give me the suite when i insited arguing i had a confirmed suite they said air conditioning was not working then it was under construction oh i said so if it is under constriction no one is staying in the room so i would like to see it that was impossible and refused they tried to lie there way out of it this is unacceptable lucy did not care since she knew i had no other alternatives this caused delays agravation and a lot trouble for my meetings this is not acceptable the next day i complained to senior management and two hours later they gave me a tower suite and i did not have to pay for the first night i did appreciate the management s gesture but did not compensate for the trouble and time i lost i am still waiting for a formal excuse letter that i have not received until now i will probably never receive it i can only advice to all travellers to beware and make sure you confirme before your arrival at the hotel
