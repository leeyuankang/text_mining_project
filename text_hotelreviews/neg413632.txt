we arrived late due to a flight delay upon arrival they didn t have our booking even though i had my booking confirmation we had booked a really nice room but there were none available so we had to take the standard room we had to still pay the price of our original booking for the better room though staff were apologetic and we only had to pay for one night instead of as we missed a night due to the delay
