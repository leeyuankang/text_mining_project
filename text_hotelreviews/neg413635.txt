service level was poor no service at the pool bar had to go get drink yourself at the bar personnel really slow and uninterested showering in the bathtub while i asked for a shower in the booking but they didn t have this facility except in the suites which were fully booked smelled in the hallway i got two separate beds pushed together while i selected a kingsize door from the minibar cabinet was broken and out breakfast area too massive not intimate at all very uncomfortable breakfast in room service very minimal most of the room service services were not available between pm so they couldn t meet my girlfriend s allergy demands i sleep in hotels almost of my time and must say this was one of the worst value for money hotels i ve stayed in the past year
