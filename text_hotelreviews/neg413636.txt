the breakfast experience was terrible there were easily people eating at the same time with only one omelette chef one toaster and a consistently empty pastry table also there are no irons in the room and the few they have at the reception are constantly occupied by other guests finally you need to be at the pool very early in the day to have any chance of a sun sofa or hammock
