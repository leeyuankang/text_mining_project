we were a group of friends all experienced travellers and at the end of our stay we all agreed that the staff at this hotel was perhaps the rudest slowest and generally most hostile we have ever encountered the hotel itself and its facilities are good but stay away if you plan on spending time on the rooftop or using any of the facilities at the hotel gym restaurants etc with the exeption of one nice young lady in the caf on the ground floor the staff including and in particular the service personell in the bars and restaurants reacted to every simple request with hostility as if we kept interrupting other important tasks like coffee sipping playing with smartphones and exchanging gossip in addition to being hostile they were extremely slow hard to communicate with in other languages than spanish and everything seemed impossible for instance ordering drinks and food at the same time please note that this is definitely not a question of culture or representative of barcelona we regularly travel to barcelona and we have in the past encountered wonderful and service minded staff in other hotels in the end we were genuinly shocked by the behaviour of the staff the negative atmosphere was a real moodkiller and we could not help thinking about how wasteful it is to keep such miserable employees when there are so many others out there that are in need of work and ready to give good service it really is a shame
