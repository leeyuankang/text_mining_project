sleep quality i specifically asked for a double room only to find my partner and i had been allocated a twin i presume this is because we were arriving late they did change our room the next day i was awoken by cleaners on two out of four mornings who were very noisy one lady was banging the bed against the wall in the next room which woke me up quite abruptly i asked her to please make less noise and she was a bit rude i understand she has a job to do but i am also paying to have a good night s sleep or morning lay in for that matter
