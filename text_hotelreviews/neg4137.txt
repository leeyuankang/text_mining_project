we booked a superior then upgraded to a junior suite we found a mouse in the room and it was handled terribly they moved us to a smaller room with a bad view and it was single beds pushed together they gave us the it cost to upgrade back and offered us complimentary breakfast but after seeing a mouse in our room there was no way we were going to eat there they then offered champagne which when it came to the room was not champagne at all it was sparkling wine for the amount we paid to find a mouse in the room and for the staff to not even care it s fair to say we will never be staying there again
