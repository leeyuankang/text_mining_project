the one thing we were disappointed by was when we booked a room we asked for early check in and late check out the answer was yes if it is possible at that time not surprisingly the hotel hasn t provided that as all rooms have been already booked but when we asked for late check out for extra money they continued our reservation for the room without any doubt and asked the payment for the whole day vat at once
