reception staff were generally disinterested on check in and out room was too small for family of four to share we paid extra for hotel with pool but when we went to use it at it was shut for private party later that day when i asked why we hadn t been informed the receptionists response was that he hadn t been told either so two very disappointed children and an unnecessary expense the rest of the weekend was raining though obvs not hotel s fault not good enough for a hotel that charges this much to rely on location alone
