as many people have said before the hotel was incredibly overpriced for the amount of money paid we were in one of the cheap rooms the quality was terrible broken lamp fittings and chair dirty windows and a grubby stain on the wall where a picture once hung we were so unimpressed we had to ask to be moved after the first night i thought the hotel may upgrade us as we were so discruntled but we were put into a similar room i certainly think you can find much better bang for your buck in bcn it s worth shopping around
