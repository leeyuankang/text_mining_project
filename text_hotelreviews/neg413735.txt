the standard rooms offered look like in a hostel the state of the room was really poor chipped off furniture and doors fungus all over the bathroom even the entrance door did not close propperly and made loud noise with a draft from other doors and windows for a euro a night we didnt want to stay in a hostel room we were shown the same rooms again when we asked for a new one then we realized that all pictures shown to potential guests on the net are the ones in the renovated part of the hotel going up the elevator that also leads up to the incredible rooftop are the better rooms we paid little more per night about euro and then had a really nice accomodation a shame that they dont renovate all rooms all reviews here can only be from people staying in the renovated area of this hotel at the moment it is a star hotel with star and star rooms a shame they try to still sell the unrenovated rooms to guest they should renovate even if the price per night is a little higher
