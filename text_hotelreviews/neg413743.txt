it was a very awful experience the entrance of the hotel were very dirty cigarettes every where the reception lady were nice in the beginning and after that she offered me to have an upgrade to stay in a higher floor with slippers and tea cattle with a euros a day and refused to take it and she became suddenly rude and she told me the check in is at pm and it was so i went for a walk and i came later and the same lady gave me the top floor with tea cattle slippers regarding the room i pray for the poor cleaners because they do very hard job to clean an over used room the room smells bad that i had to open the window for the whole night the sink was over flood the shower was star shower from the s so i barley managed to stay one night and cancelled the rest of my stay with a extra fees and ran away to another hotel if look for aquit hotel this is not it because big tours are staying in at the end it feels star hotel
