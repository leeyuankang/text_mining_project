i specifically requested a room with a view of the fountain and plaza espana to see the new years event from my room because of my impairment and was told my accommodation would be met i arrived and was placed on the floor which would have had a great view if it weren t for the metal grates covering every window on that floor i asked for a room change and was told i could downgrade to a smaller room on the floor and to await a call from reception so i could see the room first the follow up never happened so i stayed with my room out of spite as i was tired of being the unhappy complaining guest so i went to the terrace on the floor for the celebration two staff members told me early in the day the doors for the terrace open at and if i came early i would be sure to have a seat due to my physical impairment when i arrive at there was at least people on the terrace and hardly room to stand a manager scrambled to find one seat crammed into a corner after i hobbled downstairs to raise an another issue but no seat for my mrs it was barely a pleasant experience as i had arranged things at this hotel for the sole purpose of viewing the new year s eve celebration my requests were half heartedly met or not met at all with only a fair effort from the staff who seemed to have their decision making authority stripped from them
