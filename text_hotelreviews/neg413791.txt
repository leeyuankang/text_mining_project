we stayed at catalonia barcelona plaza for nights two of those nights were miserable because of clogged up sink and shower which was never resolved also the entire luxury bathroom in room smelled like a ditch we were not able to move to an equivalent room because nothing was available on the third day we tried the clock room with picture windows which did not open no bathtub and smelled like cigarette smoke tried room had corner view windows upon opening two windows unbelievable amount of dusts blew all over the place pick your poison we were told that the spa facility was closed on new years day because the contract people were off
