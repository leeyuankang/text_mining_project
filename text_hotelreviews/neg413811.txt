the only issue i had was at check in on day of arrival i paid for the accommodation by credit card and i had the choice of settling the bill in either gbp sterling or euros i settled in gbp sterling however in hindsight i should have settled by euro as the cost was much more by sterling the choice of payment was not fully explained to me by the reception staff and clients should be made aware of this when paying for accommodation when visiting a european destination
