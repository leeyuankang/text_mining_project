we felt that the room itself was a little dated and not as big as we were expecting we were a little disappointed with service we called to ask for a wine bottle opener an iron and an ironing board and all we got was the iron itself as the other things were not available generally we thought that the hotel was a little overpriced for such a small room but the location and views made up for it
