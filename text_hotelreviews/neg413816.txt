the staff were extremely rude and unhelpful we were checking in at we specifically requested twin beds not only at the time of booking but also at the time of check in we were given a double bed when i explained that a double was not what was booked they more or less shrugged their shoulders i paid for one room for one night this was very disappointing behavior and service
