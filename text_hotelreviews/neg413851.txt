the entire experience was really bad the staff here are pathetic to say the least absolutely no level of service we requested an early check in which they said they will try to accommodate but when we reached they told us they can t no problems there am assuming they tried i reached at and tried to check in the lady at the counter told me that the check in was from not at to top it off she was not at all inviting and quite blunt front desk is not staffed adequately and i had to wait in line for minutes yes you read that right minutes to just get a room post that the guy who takes the luggage to the room was not there and i had to wait for another minutes as they had only one guy so i ended up taking the luggage myself they didn t even have the courtesy to tell me that they will have it delivered once we got a room the hand shower was leaking which was fixed promptly we had some meal which we wanted to heat and we thought we will ask for room service i know it was a special request but when we called them the lady at counter told us rudely that this is a hotel and not an apartment and if we wanted all these facilities we shouldn t have come here i mean there is a nicer way to put things i don t think i am asking too much here basically post that avoided all interaction with the staff i would definitely not recommend this place unless there is not other hotel left to stay in paris the staff will make you feel this small you deserve better
