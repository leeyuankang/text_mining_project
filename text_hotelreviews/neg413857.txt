the hotel management seems to have a no philosophy based on lots of rules definitely not the easy going barcelona type establishment no to traditional room service choices were tele pizza and very expensive and error prone japanese no to helping us out with our appletv connection no to taking a beer from the pool to the room etc you get the idea big hotel with zero personality many of the staff tried their best but it just felt like management runs the place by the numbers and the rules not by the heart a pity almost forgot english language skills were generally poor we try to speak spanish of course but basics such as asking for a hot water pot answer was no were difficult at best
