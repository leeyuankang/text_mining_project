we had booked a superior double room but were given a twin with sofa bed when we asked about this we were told there were no double rooms we could have but to compensate were given free breakfast our room was on the second floor and the night we stayed there was a wedding reception in the ground floor reception room directly below us which meant putting up with loud music well after midnight i was surprised not to have a mini bar in the room and there were no hangers to hang long articles of clothing presumably the height of the hanging rail was intended for wheel chair users i also found i kept banging my elbow on the handrail in the shower over the bath again an adaptation for disabled guests the shower head could not be angled to anything other than straight down which meant standing awkwardly so as not to get my hair wet no shower cap provided and it also did not stay at the height i required and needed constant raising we went for breakfast at probably the most popular time and had to wait for a table even though there were tables for two empty and next to each other which could have been pushed together to accommodate the three of us couples were taken from the queue behind us and seated whilst we had to wait for a larger table to empty when a table of six left theirs was seperated to make a four and a two so why couldn t two tables be pushed together for us earlier
