we were on our way home from another area of spain and were attracted to the location of this hotel as we were travelling home by train from barcelona sants railway station early the next morning we made a one night booking with the express intention of having dinner in the hotel restaurant to avoid going out to a restaurant the booking website indicated that the hotel had a restaurant we were therefore surprised and disappointed to discover when checking in that the main hotel restaurant did not open for dinner on sunday evenings although the meal we had in the coffee shop was very acceptable we had not seen any information when booking that warned us that the main restaurant did not open on a sunday evening the air conditioning in our room was not very effective even when the thermostat was set to degrees it not seem to cool the room to that temperature and when left running at night seemed to turn itself off at some point during the night this was surprising because in my experience spanish hotel rooms usually have very effective air conditioning
