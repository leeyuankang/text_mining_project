as i arrived late at night the guy on the boarding desk was confused and not helpful at all i explained to him that i will pay for my stay tomorrow in cash but he kept telling me that he need to make a payment through my credit card and he gave me the wrong information about my room he sent me on the e floor where there was no rooms at all so i had to go back again downstairs to clear this out other staff was great and really helpful
