it was not possible to ensure a double bed room even weeks in advance my boyfriend and i had to sleep in separate beds on the first night of arrival then pack the next day before again to be moved to the double bed room that got vacated that was a bit inconvenient given we flew in barcelona very late and got to the hotel only around the previous night apart from that however a wonderful and convenient stay
