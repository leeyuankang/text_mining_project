the sound isolation in the hotel is horrible we could barely sleep waking up at every morning due to walking sounds the hotel does not handle over bookings well we had to argue and almost cancel because the room we requested was originally not available eventually we got the room that we asked for the air conditioning is very weak the hotel lobby is extremely hot and the hotel apparently controls your ac you go to sleep with ac on and wake up with fan mode full of sweat then you call the reception to find out they manually disabled ac for your room the toilet room is not very private and not isolated you can hear everything going in the toilets as the only thing used for separation is a sliding wooden door
