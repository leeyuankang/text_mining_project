the staffs in the breakfast buffet always try to take away the plates of dishes making a lot of noises although we were still eating they never ask us if we finish eating and they made much noise when taking away the dishes so we couldn t have relaxed breakfast during our stay the room was much more tinny than expected and the bath space was just separated with a thin wall
