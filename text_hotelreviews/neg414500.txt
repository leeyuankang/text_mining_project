the room was filled with a sort of old unpleasant perfume smell or some sort of very powerful soap smell to the point that my clothes were smelling the same after leaving the hotel the overall feel of the place was not so pleasant dark not well illuminated that gives you a claustrophobic hostile feeling the hotel was so busy that you could find long queues at the reception desk hotel did not have tissue boxes in the room and when i asked for one they said sorry they we re out hotel room did not have spoons in the room how am i supposed to mix my coffee in the morning
