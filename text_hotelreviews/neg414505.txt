the whole building smells like the chemicals they use for cleaning i think it s not possible to open a window guests are completely dependent of the airconditioning system for fresh air furthermore i disliked the separation between the toilet shower area and the sinks making use of only a poor wooden sliding door that doesn t close that well also it doesn t suit my preference for a minimum level of privacy when i am making use of the toilet or shower
