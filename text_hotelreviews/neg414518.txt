the air conditioning has issues was malfunctioning some nights and is not reaching target temperature i had issues with payment from my cards due to issues with the limit they got me an exception to pay for night and then they were firm and left a notice in reception not to go up to the room unless all nights are paid in an unpleasant way was not happy with the situation overall yet the hotel is good on other aspects
