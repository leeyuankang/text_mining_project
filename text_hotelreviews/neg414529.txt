the hotel has space travel as its theme no doubt this sounded like a great idea when it was originally put to the board as a concept but in reality they ve gone a bit too far and it s ended up spoiling what would otherwise be quite a nice station hotel corridors are so dark you can hardly see the room numbers and the lighting in the rooms is not much better a triumph of style over substance we arrived mid evening and hoped to eat at the hotel there were two fed up looking women in the cafeteria and no one in the much advertised a la carte restaurant the one waiter on duty seemed completely unfamiliar with the concept of a la carte and only offered a very poor menu of the day not at all what i d expect from a four star hotel restaurant offering particularly one with a supposed reputation for food we ended up taking a metro a couple of stops and eating elsewhere
