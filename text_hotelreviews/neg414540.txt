it is a fairly large hotel which lacks a personal touch the only hotel staff we saw during the stay was the staff at the reception and our only interaction was during checkin and checkout the entrance to the hotel at the ground floor was very challenging to find it is almost like a hole in the wall there was some work going on and there were no signs also there was only one operational lift to the lobby floor from the ground floor where the station is located it was really small and seemed like a fair amount of wait every time not at all adequate for a hotel this size this was not an issue however from the lobby to higher floors
