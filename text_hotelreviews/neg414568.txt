due to what looked like renovation work the bottom entrance of the hotel was hidden apart from a couple of signs to point you in the right direction we actually didn t find this until we done a complete of the hotel so could definitely do with a few more signs around the station and outside also there s two sets of stairs that you can take up to the hotel these would have been better if they d been signposted too as we only noticed when we came out the main entrance obviously this could be something that the hotel could improve but i wouldn t let that stop you from staying here
