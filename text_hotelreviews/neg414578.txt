really noisy we could hear the people walking in the room above us and we could hear other guests in the hallway from inside our room at we were woken by a screaming baby from another room this should never happen in a hotel walls are paper thin and cheap like the toilet paper they use from far off this hotel seems great but when you look closer they have missed quite a few little things that make a hotel worth the price tag sound proofing being the biggest the rooms are set out weird like a studio this is ok if you are a single person but if your a couple you risk waking your partner to use the bathroom as the lighting is all in one room location is great for the train station but a bit far for most other attractions i would recommend this hotel if you re passing through barcelona for a night otherwise i would go further into the city centre
