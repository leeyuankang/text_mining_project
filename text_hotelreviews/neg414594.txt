unfortunately despite the hotel s very good location the access path is far from being ideal depending on where you re coming from you either have to walk all the way across the rail station if you arrive during the day in order to access the only hotel entrance on all sides of the rail station or go all the way around the entire building and it s a pretty massive building you have to circumnavigate if you arrive after midnight when the rail station is closed alternatively you have to go up some stairs located on one of the corners of the station hotel building and then walk across a car rental parking lot to access the ground level entrance of the hotel pavement and renovation works undertaken outside the station hotel building don t really help with the ease of access to the hotel entrance either apart from that there s no other major con worth mentioning although they could be a little more generous with their instant coffee and sugar sachets also why is there no milk for the coffee in the room
