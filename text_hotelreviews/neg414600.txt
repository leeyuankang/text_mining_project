the hotel is rather far from the main touristic attractions km of walking you better use subway to get to rambla the negative side of the thematic design is darkness in elevator s hall corridors and your bathroom shower hose in our room was leaking and the toilet brush was lost somewhere in the outer space the room door was not soundproof and we heard all the noises from the corridor the hotel was busy on a weekend we stayed there and a check in procedure was rather long in the midnight the alarm clock suddenly woke us up and it was not easy to switch it off
