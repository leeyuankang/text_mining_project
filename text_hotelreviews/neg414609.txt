the wifi connection is not really strong in room sometimes it is down and i need to go outside the room first or to lobby to get it connected the staff when we checked in is quite friendly however they didn t give consistent information for example on the day we arrived we are given the room with poor wifi connection and they said it is because a problem in server so that they gave us new room but i think the connection is still poor also when i asked for an electric kettle in the room one said that it is not complimentary for my room type and i need to pay euro per day and on the other day the other staff said that they can give it to my room
