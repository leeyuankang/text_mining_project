there were no signs within the barcelona sants station for the barcelo hotel the entrance door was outside at the rear of the station to the right of the building access to reception was down an unmanned corridor on the ground floor which led to a lift lobby area being a solo female traveller and arriving late in the evening there were a few people hanging around the outside and it felt a bit unsafe and uninviting for a hotel of this rating
