the first room allocated was not as clean as usual and was very hot as measured by one of the maintenance staff and not adjustable we were moved to a second room which was better but again it was not possible to regulate the air conditioning and we spent a miserable almost sleepless night because it was so hot we had to sleep with the door open to get some cool air in we reported this to reception on checkout
