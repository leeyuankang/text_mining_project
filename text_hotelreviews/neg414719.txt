the only little gripe would be that the glass shower screen was not totally shower proof and water would leak out onto the bathroom floor also the location of the hotel is very good if you don t mind taking the underground i don t think its centrally enough placed if you were looking to walk everywhere the space theme in the communal areas may not be to everyones liking
