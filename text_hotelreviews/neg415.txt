the room was a lot smaller than advertised i requested a room on the top floor was originally put on the floor they changed me to a room on the top floor only to find out at that the room had previous electrical issues that they knew about which hadn t been resolved and caused a loud knocking noise once reported to the front desk i was asked to move rooms at no assistance was offered second room was slightly larger than the first but not by much i thought the breakfast was a good quality but pretty overpriced beds were rather stiff but not entirely uncomfortable i didn t find the staff very friendly they weren t mean they just didn t seem very keen on being pleasant bad day maybe the gym is not worth calling a gym has some meager cardio equipment no real ventilation no tv
