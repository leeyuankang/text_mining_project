breakfast seemed chaotic the first morning we went to the buffet to get our cooked breakfast when we returned to the table it had been completely cleared the very disinterested supervisor apologised but did nothing in the end we had to go to another table to get cutlery and cups breakfast was now cold coffee did eventually arrive i like hot milk with my coffee which wasn t a problem but in the second morning the hot milk arrived but was quite clearly off it took some minutes for anyone to come close to the table and even longer to get a replacement cup and milk the cup had a huge chip in the rim so yet again we had to wait
