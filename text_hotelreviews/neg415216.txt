i booked triple rooms months before my arrival and i asked interconected rooms but i was surprized that our rooms were not pre arranged and finally we got seperate rooms which gives the impression that they do not care about their customers the car park is very expensive per day and such expensive hotel should at least provide free or cheaper car park
