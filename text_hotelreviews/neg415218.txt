two significant problems a a service charge is automatically added to your restaurant bar bill the fact that there is a service charge is in the very small detail on the back page of the menu very difficult to note in advance of purchase supposedly discretionary but it is automatically added thus you have to have the bill reissued also unclear as to whether all the service actually goes to the staff b i had room and periodically throughout the night there was a loud noise fro the ventilator in the bathroom i called for this to be rectified bu nothing happened overall disappointing
