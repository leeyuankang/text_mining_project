the location was a little further out of the main city center than expected the neighborhood is undergoing heavy construction and renovation it was not as pleasant an area to simply hang out in with fewer restaurants close by overall it was a very nice hotel and i believe after the construction is completed it will improve the overall neighborhood feel
