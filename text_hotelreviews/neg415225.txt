the parking was awkward you had to go into the hotel first to get an allocated space which costs for the night which i think it s extortionate for parking but there we go then drive around the building and enter on the left they explain it to you which is fine but considering there s double yellows outside and only permit holders parking it s awkward to leave car if you re alone in order to get the gate key and information
