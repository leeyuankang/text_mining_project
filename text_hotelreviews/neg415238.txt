i paid full amount of approx upon check in but i was very upset to be asked to pay an additional per night as a deposit i queried what the deposit was for and was told it was to cover if i got drinks at the bar or needed laundry done or if i wanted to add in my daughters for breakfast theirs weren t included i said that i had stayed in numerous hotels all around europe including uk and had never been asked for such a thing i said i would pay for drinks at the bar or breakfast there and then if needed i have never had my laundry done in any hotel but if i did i would pay up front there and then they insisted i pay and i asked for a manager who struggled to justify this and tried to convince me this was for my benefit what kind of fool did she think i was did they expect that i might trash the room or steal the towels or the tv they had my visa debit card details and my passport just in case she eventually agreed to reduce the deposit to which i still wasn t happy about but grudgingly agreed as we were all tired and wanted to get to our room imagine all the extra interest earned on all of the per room per night per marriott hotel that floats through the company account before the money is refunded it will probably take a week before my deposit re appears in my account next morning our daughters did decide they wanted breakfast we were told it would be each however if we went to reception and got a voucher it would be i queued for minutes at reception and gave up they went up to starbucks up the road instead the breakfast myself and my wife had was nothing spectacular typical tepid buffet stuff
