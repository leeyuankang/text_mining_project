three of staff were very unfriendly didn t understand what we were asking weren t bothered or that was how they came across bacon and beans at breakfast were cold we tried to have a meal on saturday evening we were the only guests in there and we were told to get our own drinks across the other side of the hotel as she was on her own then after taking our order she came back to say there wasn t any focaccia for our starters at that point we cancelled our order and left we ordered sandwiches in the bar ham and tuna but we got cheese and chicken potato wedges were not cooked and had to be sent back total chaos though the lady was very apologetic although a break with family we do use marriott hotels across the uk and overseas for business so i wanted to see how well our visit went with a view to using this venue at a future date not a good experience i m afraid
