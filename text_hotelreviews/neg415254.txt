very pricey room without breakfast over easter price was steep irrelevant it was easter for us as we only stayed as nearby daughter had new baby pool was outside and round the corner shut at when we stayed pool small crowded and up freezing public stairs husband told had to pay for locker padlock very disappointing as we hoped pool would be main relaxation for us no moving or magnifying mirror in bathroom obviously really meant for business men on expense accounts
