the buffet was not worth the euros and if you know what good french croissants and coffee taste like you will be disappointed the breakfast selections seemed to cater more for travelers who might not care there are a few cafes nearby who do a better job the neighborhood is decent during the day very commercial at night it s a little transient but if you re used to big cities it won t bother you the decor is a bit odd kind of kitschy but it s mostly clean and bright hooks in the bathroom for towels and robes would be nice this is not a place to go if you want a classic french experience it has more of a tokyo vibe however i would go back again the staff make the experience excellent
