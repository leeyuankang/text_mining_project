for one night of parking is extortionate wasn t aware of the deposit payment upon arrival in case of ordering of room service etc bed was stiff but may be as new bizarre having to walk out and round the corner of the hotel to use the pool nearly for breakfast was overpriced wifi only free in the lobby have to pay extra everywhere else
