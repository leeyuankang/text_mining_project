i would have preferred to be informed that the swimming pool and gym isn t located at the hotel but around the corner so you actually have to leave the hotel as its misleading to say you have these facilities when they are in different locations breakfast was very average one of the managers had a word with her colleague in front of us which wasn t pleasant to see it seems not everyone was on the same page the cocktails were horrible from the bar i was just happy it was for it also would have helpful if we were told the hotel is under construction and there will be a lot of noise from because then i would have booked somewhere much peaceful or be prepared for the noise because of the constructions we had to make plans everyday to avoid all the heavy banging definitely not booking that again
