for paris standards the room size is ok in general is small small bathroom do not choose the superior room almost the same size of other rooms not a good value i was traveling with family and friends people when i arrived i had the feeling that the manager was not happy with all those people in the front desk i did not feel comfortable with that that was not my first time in this hotel and the last time my experience was much better
