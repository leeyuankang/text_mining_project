booked into a room that was adjacent to where building work hammer drills stated at on easter sunday hotels response was we have to do emergency work duty manager suspect very strongly this was not true as this happens a lot as we are doing refurbishment work room cleaning lady lots of people have complained but we need to do the refurbishment when asked why i was booked into a room next to a building site i received a shrug of the shoulders i was moved to a different room hotel very warm and stuffy supposed to have air con but only heating and air circulation was available in both rooms so why does the hotel say it has air con in each room object very strongly to having a service charged being automatically added when buying a drink standing at the bar employers like marriott are supposed to pay at least the minimum wage so i really wonder who receives the benefit of the service charge
