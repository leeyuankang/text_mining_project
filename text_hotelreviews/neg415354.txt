it was a bit odd that there was just one apple one mars bar and one bottle of water when we arrived and only the water was replaced for the second evening we went to the restaurant and felt the service was quite slow considering the amount of staff and the few people in there we had to wait a while for our food despite the first being only bread however the staff were lovely and also helpful and polite we were annoyed to be charged a service charge and then asked for a gratuity too we would have tipped but for the service charge as we felt this should be a choice
