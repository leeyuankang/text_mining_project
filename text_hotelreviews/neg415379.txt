we though the pool was part of the hotel but it turns out it s the gyms next door so it s not just for hotel use had to pay to park at the hotel over night which i though was a bit steep location was good but minute walk up the road was dodgy young gangs robbing the local shops made me feel in safe cleaners in the morning knocked once and woke us up and opened the door luckily we had the inside lock on so they couldnt just walk in because the door only opened so far with the lock on rooms are a bit dated and bathrooms could do with a makeover
