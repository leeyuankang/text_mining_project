the full benefits of the executive lounge were not explained on check in there for we missed out on free beverages afternoon tea canapes partly our own fault for not reading literature given to us however i do feel reception staff should have highlighted freebies on check in the room was great for us although the mattress on the sofa bed was past its best i asked for another mattress or atleast a mattress topper but instead got a blanket laid on top of mattress so had to put up with my teenagers complaining each morning how uncomfortable it was
