upon checking in we were assigned a room on the second floor the walls were dirty and when i sat on the bed sank to the ground i complained to the front desk and we were moved to the sixth floor what is considered the executive level the rooms are very dated the bed was way too soft the bath tub is very high and narrow and dangerous to step in and out of closet space is practically zero and dresser drawers are so thin that we lived out of our suitcase the entire week as a marriott silver elite member i was rather surprised this was not what i expected for a martiott property
