we booked executive room with free late check out and free wifi but it turned out that during check out they asked out to pay for the wifi and when we told them about our room category they were not aware of the offer and then they removed the bill of wifi and the late check out was only till pm and most of the hotels accept check out at this time for free and the executive lounge was not worthy compared to marriott parklane as there was nothing to do in it and only limited selection of food and even breakfast was not to the standard will stay here next time due to the location but will take the basic room as you do not need to pay extra charge for things that you will not benefit from and there are lots of coffee shops nearby so no need to pay extra charge for breakfast
