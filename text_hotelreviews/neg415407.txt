one evening at dinner a man in a group of three right on the other side of the restaurant was using profanities swearing at the top of his voice right throughout the meal and he and his dinner companions semmed to thing it hugely amusing finally i had to send my year old twin daughters back to the room to get them away from it and my wife and i had to finish our dinner early as well i remonstrated with him as i left but he thought that was hugely funny as well it is not the hotel s fault although the restaurant manager and the duty manager both apolgised to me it was just one of those unpleasant experiences we sometimes have in life today i will still be happy to return to the marriott maida vale when i am again in london
