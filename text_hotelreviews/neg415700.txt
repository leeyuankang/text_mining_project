be aware that if your room is in the regent wing that this feels completely separate from the main building of the hotel and means there is a bit of a trek to the facilities including the excellence club on the other side of the hotel however the room was very spacious especially for london and seemed recently renovated so there were some benefits to this room including a view down regent street
