service was poor for a star hotel from checking in to check out it was just ok coffee is better at starbucks unless you take an espresso the service is very slow i have stayed at better star hotels in london in the same area at the same price that were delivering also the rooms were a disappointment compared to photographic images they were too photoshoped and did not represent the reality we were somewhat disappointed
