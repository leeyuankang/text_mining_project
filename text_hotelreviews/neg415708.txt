the last time i stayed at langham london with my family was superb however this time was totally different it was a storm day and we had the scaries flight back from berlin and our train back to home got cancelled so we stayed at langham because i always thought it is the best hotel in london however i was surprised the way of talking that one of the staff in the lobby to help me and my boyfriend with luggages he checked my boyfriend up and down with his eyes and talked arrogantly to me and him he looks he never been here before and then he smiled very scornedly i could not believe that was the staff talks in a fancy hotel how rude it was and we are asian so it feels more races we have lived in england for years and we know how bad it gonna be me and my boyfriend travel a lot and have never experienced such a horrible attitude from a hotle like langham it is a big shame for this hotle and my choice too i swear i will never ever stay at any langham hotels over the world my family and all my friends will not as well i need the manager of langham london to give me a explanation that me and my boyfriend both will accept thank you very much
