this hotel should not be rated as wheelchair accessible the entrance is not wheelchair accessible except through their excess ability lift which was broken upon our arrival this made our stay very uncomfortable as we had to travel in and out of the hotel through the spa which is also not very wheelchair friendly with the step at the main door and two steps to get you into the building the wheelchair ramp at the spa is too narrow to fit my mothers wheelchair which is wider than average what makes things more complicated is that the spa closes at pm and if you intend to stay out later than that the hotel personal had to take us through the back doors of the loading area of the hotel into our bedroom which was a very unpleasant experience even to get to the spa we had to travel from our floor to the ground floor take another lift to the first floor through long corridoors and then another lift and then go all the way at the other end of the building and finally into the spa it truly was like a maze very ridiculous to spend about minutes every time we wanted to leave or enter the hotel moreover to go to breakfast at the club lounge we had to travel from our bedroom to the lobby at the ground floor and take a service elevator to the club lounge so the clubroom that is wheelchair accessible has no accessibility to the club lounge because it has a few steps at the entrance we checked out the next day was not worth the daily struggle in my opinion the hotel should ve given us a courtesy call to inform us about the broken lift and gave us a choice to change our reservation to a more accessible hotel they also should have offered to deliver breakfast to the bedroom every day instead of us traveling to different elevators every day to get to the club lounge finally beds are too high for a disabled person can t get in or out without assisstance
