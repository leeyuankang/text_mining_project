breakfast was expensive even by the standards of the hotel i suppose the average person staying at the langham wouldn t bat an eyelid at a head for breakfast but it seemed excessive to me so we opted not to take breakfast hardly a complaint to be honest as we had plans for food anyway so wouldn t have taken it regardless of the price but it did seem over the top to me
