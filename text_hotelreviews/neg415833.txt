the breakfast was very poor there was hardly any choice on the cold buffet no cereals etc for full english breakfast there was choice of either sausages bacon or omelettes i didn t check the vegetarian option for the astronomical price charged the breakfast was not worth it also while we were eating at the table the waitress started making up the next table and waving the tablecloths which is very poor manners it was past am on sunday and there was clearly no great rush to do it
