i booked a grand twin room whose size was recorded as square meters in fact the room looked very small and the size was like square meters maybe a structure problem or anything else i asked a high floor with nice view at reservation with nights but found the assignment in a completely opposite way it was totally out of my expectation with a high price room reservation the room also had a shower drain problem i do not recommend a grand twin room at least for a family
