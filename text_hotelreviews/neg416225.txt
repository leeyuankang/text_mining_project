many of the staff were borderline rude and we had to complain twice about very rude staff we did think that the hotel values more pretentious clients and didn t feel welcome the management did listen to our complaints and were very convincing that things would change the hotel is very new and these maybe teething troubles the food in the many restaurants was not very good and certainly not worth the money
