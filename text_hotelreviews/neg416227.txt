first thing s first the ned is a really good hotel i just have a few quibbles and i share them more in the way of hoping they will be constructive than as barbed criticism the light issue many reviews have mentioned this and it is a problem the lighting levels are way too dark whilst i m fine with atmospheric lighting in the public areas in the bedrooms it is verging on absurd even with all the many convoluted lamp systems switched on you still need a torch yes a torch to find anything at night that s just silly they should sort this out the wardrobes the wardrobes provided in the cozy room are completely inadequate for anything more than a one night stay there is only a half size provision for hanging items which might be fine if you re a bloke and only want to hang jackets but you re out of luck if you re not and you have dresses they just don t fit the wardrobe also squeezes in the room s only set of small drawers totally inadequate storage even for guest travelling light i can t imagine what it must be like for a couple sharing the room for several nights the restaurant hotel club balance one of the big drawbacks about staying in such a popular establishment is that you ve got little chance of being able to dine in one of the or so restaurants for any meal including breakfast unless you book well in advance i tried to have breakfast in the hotel every day of my day stay and was told every day the restaurants were full the only place i ever managed to eat at was the deli a toasted bagel isn t really the kind of breakfast you expect for a hotel it does very much feel the the f b and the private club are the main focus and the hotel and its customer are a bit of an afterthought hopefully these small issues get resolved in time as this really is a good hotel
