it didn t bother me but the only criticism i would have is that the bedrooms are noisy as they are all above the super noisy lobby bar area so if you want a peaceful early night this isn t the place for you neither if you want a quieter romantic meal is this for you i absolutely loved it though and the value for money v its competitors i would class this as placed like me london etc is incredible
