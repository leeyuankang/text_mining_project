rooms giving on to the atrium are extremely noisy owing to the restaurants on the ground floor and the absence of sufficient insulation for the windows this is a very significant problem in the meantime ask for a room on the outside of he hotel one that doesn t give on to the atrium i would also say that the hotel has yet to reconcile what it wants to be and what it s priorities are hotel reception was brilliant accommodating to a fault welcoming friendly efficient but the hotel is also a private club and has several independently operated restaurants and bars that are not nearly as interested in prioritizing service for hotel guests on multiple occasions we were made to feel distinctly unwelcome in the restaurants and bars since we were merely hotel guests and not club members that is somewhat odd particularly since over my short stay i paid nearly half as much as a club member would pay in dues for an entire year i hope these are simply growing pains but i fear they might be a feature by design
