went to rooftop pool and the young guy at the desk had a poor attitude asked us to bring our room cardholder to access the rooftop area as if i d done something wrong despite the fact i showed i had my room key and given my name which was checked against a list more his individual attitude manner that was not befitting of a star hotel had to open the door for ourselves with suitcases on the way out whilst staff members inside the hotel who were not clearly identifiable as were not wearing uniforms stood and chatted would never have happened at shangri la where we stayed the next night other members of staff however were very pleasant seems to be luck of the draw whoever you interact with minor issues above which did not detract from overall quality of stay but you would expect not to happen in a star hotel
