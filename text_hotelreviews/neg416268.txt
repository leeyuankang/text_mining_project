the room was very noise and could not open the window at night for security reasons so for people like me who like a bit of fresh air at night this was problematic till am when i had to call the reception you could hear an on going subtle noise of music bum bum they said the had music all over the night and eventually turned the volume down there was an empty bottle under the bed when i got in and where disappointed when i found out that the cosy rooms had no bath though on the sites it says room facilities air conditioning iron desk ironing facilities heating wardrobe closet cleaning products clothes rack shower hairdryer bathrobe toilet bathroom bath or shower
