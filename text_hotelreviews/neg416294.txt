my room was small for what i consider medium also straight in front of the bed was an odd panel that could have easily been addressed with a tapestry or some other creative solution it looked like an ironing board door but not properly finished there was also a large leak discoloration on the ceiling room when i was checking out unfortunately their was an enormous ceiling leak in the lobby
