very rude concierge who i mistakenly asked where i could get towels as he was in a uniform on the roof terrace by the pool instead of finding somebody who could help he just said i dont know i am a concierge ask a waiter the pool gets incredibly busy and unless you get there super early on a nice day you won t get a lounger or even a chair there is no reserving either or preference for hotel guests i would also say the vibe arround the pool is a bit pretentious
