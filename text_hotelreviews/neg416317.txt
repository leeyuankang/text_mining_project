we felt the level of service in the bar restaurant was very poor we were also asked to wait mins to be able to have a drink in the vault even though it was half empty we were also told that we couldn t have dinner on the roof as we weren t members and because there were of us looking to eat we were told if we were members they could accommodate us or if there was only eating such a stupid thing to say to guests even if that was the rule we probably wouldn t return to this hotel in the future
