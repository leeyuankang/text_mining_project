cranky people only a couple of persons from the staff were really nice to us the concierge people from the reception the valet just after check out we realised we had some time to kill until leaving to the airport so we wanted to grab a coffee on the terrace and we were not allowed anymore it was just a coffee that made me realise what horrible service you have and that you don t value anything you take our money and then that s it there was another guy at one of the restaurants in the lobby the first on the left side from the main entrance who was very rude to us we sat down and asked for a coffee while waiting to leave to the airport and minutes after he brought the coffee he asked us to leave because there were people that wanted to eat although it s members only i really don t see a great service for the guests or members or just visitors i think you need to improve a lot if you really want to have top service for a hotel despite all that i am still coming back i hope to have a better experience on my future stay
