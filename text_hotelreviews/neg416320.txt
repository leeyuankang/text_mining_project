the a c didn t work in our room and we had a very uncomfortable night as it was a very hot day there were no bath towels provided discovered after i got in the shower small annoyances like no hooks in the bathroom cheap acrylic instead of cotton robes the greeter and server at breakfast were a bit snotty and not welcoming the breakfast itself was probably the worst eggs benedict i ve ever had compared to the breakfast at other luxury hotels in london it was a joke much of this could be attributed to the hotel being newly opened and all the bugs not worked out
