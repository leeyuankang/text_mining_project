it was a little posey on the rooftop pool area but that s to be expected as a private members club also the hotel took a large deposit from my credit card which they didn t make me aware of so it was quite a surprise when i checked my bank statement after the trip the bank has informed me that they will be keeping this for days before it s released back to me
