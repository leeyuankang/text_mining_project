no disabled access to either pools very poor considering it is a spa hotel and meant my mum could not enjoy either pools the hot water did not work in the room they kindly upgraded us to another room however we could not gain access to the room having arrived at the hotel at the wrong cases were delivered to our room i tried to contact concierge but the telephone did not work and to top it all they even tried to charge us for a complimentary pressubg service so all in all not a great experience for a a night star hotel
