the ground floor is a huge space advertised as eight restaurants but in fact is one huge bar area with live music it is possible to get different types of food in the various corners but many of the tables are low with easy chairs around the ambient noise is such that a private conversation is next to impossible good for a drink if you like bustling places not good for a quiet dinner
