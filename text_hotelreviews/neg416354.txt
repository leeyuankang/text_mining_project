the room was very quiet with the window over the central atrium until they started emptying a weeks worth of bottles from restaurants and god knows how many bars into the recycling that started at and lasted despite a phone complaint to reception until on a saturday it s the only thing i can fault but it did spoil my stay somewhat having got in a i was looking forward to a lay in i also had some trouble with the electronic room key these are minor points and i m sure they will be sorted out overall a very positive experience
