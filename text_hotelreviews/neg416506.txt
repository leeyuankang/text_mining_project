the one bad experience we had was at breakfast which we didn t have included but we tried it one morning my husband ordered the scrambled egg whites when his eggs arrived they brought regular eggs no problem i called the waitress and pointed out the error she gave me attitude and brought out the correct order however as my husband took a bite of his dish there was a long hair hanging from his fork when i called the manager over and explained firstly and attitude of the waitress and secondly the hair incident he didn t apologize all he asked was if we wanted it redone no of course not appetite was all gone then i had to even ask them to remove it from the bill pour customer service and attitude completely uncalled for in a top rated restaurant
