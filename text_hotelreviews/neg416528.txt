we got a nice corner room which was a bit to sterile no decoration no carpets with more that a bit ab used furniture this style is really easy to clean but time and previous guests left many wounds on all surfaces windows covers movable woody surfaces are very fancy and a good solution to spare curtains but they should have grips to be moved one of ours was broken and don t replaced since long time we could appreciate all fingerprints on the surface left from people who were trying to move the surface to be open or closed as we did too standing lamps are of cheap quality and had suffered from many injuries due to easy falling down we spend christmas eave with a dinner arranged by the loft restaurant per person terrible overpriced and not really good pigeon was so skinny that we could only lick bones really not good choice and we needed to ask every time for a few drops of wine we paid for travelling a lot around the world we were a bit disappointed with the above issues
