for the days of our stay we stayed in the white room suite the electricity of the entire room kept on turning on by itself at am in the morning the electrician claimed to have resolved the issue by the day but alas the last nights were as horrible as the first their room service poor choices and way too salty for anyone s taste they ended up only cutting euros from our bill for a horrendous sofitel experience utterly disappointing for this hotel to be claiming its star rank among those in vienna
