most staff were not attentive to us or didnt seem to care or be helpful i dont want to play the race card but that seemed to be the only plausible explanation we were not assisted with our luggage to our rooms we were not even shown to the lifts which were in some corner although we had witnessed how helpful and willing to help they were with other guests on one day my husband got in the lift with an elderly couple and you could see how they physically clinged to one another and made sure that when they got off on their floor they shut the lift door behind them one of those ancient open the door lifts so he could not follow them it was quite upsetting maybe not many black people stay in such nice hotels
