though the size of the room was quiet fair but i didnt like the setting of the bathroom it didnt seem to be modern and i felt the cleaning wasn t proper though i do not mean to say that the room or bathrooms were dirty the bathroom fittings and towels were dated and not as per the standard as expected the carpets in the rooms and outside were not upto the standard as expected the wallpaper makes the room look over the top but at the same time did not give a feeling of a five star hotel but instead of a boarding house the temperature of the room was bit high for my liking and it couldnt be controlled from the controller as it had zero effect of the temperature of the room and fortunately i had a room with huge windows and i kept them open for cool breeze and fresh air the hotels had in stock much less umbrellas as required for the guests the weather at amsterdam is unpredictable
