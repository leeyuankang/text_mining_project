staff not helpful as i requested to change my room on first day because it located in the ground floor next to main road and was very noisy and not comfortable but they just ignore me i requested also to clean my room every day before pm also they ignore my requisite tv channels not working and i did ask front desk to fix it but once again they ignore me beside all that star hotel without air conditions was surprise for me frankly overall experience was very disappointed and not worth payment for star
