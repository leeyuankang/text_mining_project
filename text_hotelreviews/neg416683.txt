the service the quality of the rooms especially the one they gave is a room right beside construction works that is super noisy at located in the farthest end of the building with no view which is smaller than most rooms as well and it felt like we re in a dungeon worst off i booked and paid advance but the time that we checked out asked us to pay additional additional for the rooms coz apparently the amount paid on prepaid was just for reservation i m so confused coz it defeats the purpose of what booking com is offering overall very unpleasant experience
