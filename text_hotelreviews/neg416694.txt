you get what you pay for this is a great hotel right near the train station hotels are a people to people business the person that checked me in walked me back to my room she didn t want me to get lost since the hotel is chunked up a bit into sections and mazes she had my luggage the whole way the food from room service was excellent and on time the entire staff was friendly my bartender one night tried to teach me some dutch forget the think in terms of you have worked hard travel in europe can be tiring and you deserve a bit of a rest i had some trouble connecting to the internet and staying connected i actually think it was settings on my devices that got changed and not indicative of issues at the hotel since entering the netherlands my phone had issues which resolved themselves upon leaving the netherlands
