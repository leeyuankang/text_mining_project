room service could be improved the room service number never answered tried so i had to call reception and they had someone call me back the steak and fries were nearly cold when they arrived also the steak wasn t salted and was not served with sauce as it was described so nearly cold steak with no salt or sauce but i was too hungry and it was too late for me to bother calling again and waiting for service i ended up using the mayonnaise for the fries as the sauce
