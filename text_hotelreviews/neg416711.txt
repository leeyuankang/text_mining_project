the hotel was very drab it was dark and kind of unsettling even our couch was black don t want to even consider what was hiding there the staff seemed very friendly our room was not clean by past check in so they gave us a complimentary upgrade and one free drink ticket for people the free drink ticket was humorous the bartender ended up giving us free drinks because it seemed ridiculous upon checkout we were charged for the complimentary upgrade the woman took our information and said she d call after they figured out what happened there no one has contacted us it s been days the room was rushed when they set it up for us there was trash on the window sills and our mini fridge was not restocked we had ordered champagne to be in the room when we arrived but had to call down times before it arrived then the guy who delivered our luggage was basically asking for a tip we didn t have any euro on us checking in here is not a fun process the whole thing is a scam our room itself was stories sounds nice but it was a complete pain the stairs are very narrow and hard to get up and down the bedroom is on the second floor but the bathrooms are on the first and third the entire room was very dark and almost wet you have no control of the air just heat also for a star hotel there were no robes something i always look forward to i m honestly not sure how this hotel has stars i d give stars to the breakfast but to the hotel itself
