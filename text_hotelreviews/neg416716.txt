be careful enough what side of the hotel your room is on get on the smaller canal side not the side of the main road it is noisy to say nothing of the construction going on right outside the hotel we had to move rooms after one night it was so bad the girl who checked us in made a mistake and put us on the wrong side breakfast was good but service not good you order eggs if you are not treated as though you are invisible and then they forget to get them from the kitchen when you repeatedly chase up they finally come cold and rubbery as they had been waiting to be delivered for so long this happened two days in a row so on the third day we went into the kitchen ourselves to monitor and get the eggs when cooked all was good after that
