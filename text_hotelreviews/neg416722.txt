appalling value for money in my opinion this is not a hotel cleanliness in the room was a joke the bathroom although looked great had a faulty sink and shower the heating was inadequate for the room the broken down elevator which was still not fixed on my departure i was promised an ipod dock on arrival which i specially requested and then had to argue the point and pay a deposit when the hotel agreed to fulfill the original promise not enough hangers the steam room is not hot enough and does not generate enough steam the staff hovering for a tip was incredibly uncomfortable i would not stay here again also my cc has been overcharged by a lot
