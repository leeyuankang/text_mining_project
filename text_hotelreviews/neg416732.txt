we d usually leave the room around explore the city and get back around at which point our room would still not have been clean housekeeping would then turn up between and which seems way later than anywhere else we ve ever stayed at this time we want to relax and get ready before heading out for the evening but the guys cleaning the room there was a window in our room but it overlooked other windows we booked two single beds but got a double had been travelling all day so didn t bother mentioning this but wouldbhave been nice if they got it right the hotel looks a bit dated in the cooridoors
