the general poor state of the bathroom especially the leaking shower screen and i spent half an hour looking for the remote control for the curtains after it was stressed to me to us only this means for opening and closing after failing to find the said remote control i checked the curtains to find they were manual closing so better staff training on each rooms specific characteristics would certainly assist and create a more professional informed feeling for the guest s please understand this is a minor matter and i did see the funny side it is just confusion when non is needed
