i requested a canal view room and though we were on the canal side of the hotel you could only see the canal if you stood on your tiptoes and opened the window our room on the floor was in the roof with half size windows so all you could see was the rooftops of the city which wasn t too bad really but not what i wanted i did ask to be moved but i was told there was no other rooms available on lower floors the decor of the hotel is very drab but then i suppose it s quaintness would appeal to some the cleaning of the room and lift dirty carpet and mirrors that never seen a cloth left a lot to be desired in the nights we stayed our towels were changed every day well day is not really true as we waited till one night to have our room made up not what you want after a full day sightseeing to come back to an unmade room and the glasses cups changed and bed made but i could write my name in the dust on the furniture on the day i left not what i expected for a star hotel
