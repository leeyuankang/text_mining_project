the room was not ready until hours after we arrived the reason provided was because the previous guest checked out late however it still took a further hours after the guest checked out before the room was ready the room was not cleaned for days despite having a clean my room sign on the door minor things to complain about really but generally the hotel is definitely not star and if i d paid half of what i paid i might have been ok with the service and the hotel there are far better cheaper hotels in amsterdam i would not recommend staying here
