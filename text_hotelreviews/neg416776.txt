room is a disgrace the desk is positioned right up against the bed so to roll out of bed meant rolling onto the desk it was literally touching the bed and the tv faced away from the bed so badly you had to sit at the foot of the bed to watch it we asked esther in customer relations on the monday night if we could move and she said she would sort it for the morning came down in the morning and they had no notes from esther so we had to start all over again insisted on a room move and got which was better but was so hot we had to leave the windows open and the noisy chatter and laughter filtering up through the middle of the hotel kept us up all night and we missed breakfast the next day spoke to gino in the morning who sorted us out with an upgrade to and a bit of money back we told him if we had been staying longer than three nights we would have checked out so overall we wanted to love the amrath but in all honesty we probably won t be back how you can achieve five star status when you have no aircon and a climate control system that left me waking up in a pool of sweat defies description i honestly believe you know about the problems with room and allocated it to us because we were either first timers or were not paying full rack rate regardless you ve not made friends of someone who works in media and understands the importance of five star customer service
