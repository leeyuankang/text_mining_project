customer service wasn t great for what you re paying definitely not star we coordinated a transfer from the airport to the hotel which never turned up were offered a free trip back to the airport from the hotel due to the stuff up and had to repeat ourselves many times to get this sorted had let them know we were on our honeymoon and they put us in a room with single beds made seperately and pushed together spa services aren t of high quality despite the high cost although the actual spa area itself is gorgeous and facilities excellent room service was difficult couldn t get a simple pizza to our room after an hour of waiting and kept changing their story had to keep calling to check and cancelled the order everything basic seemed too difficult was not pleasant
