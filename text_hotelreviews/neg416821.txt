not a star hotel definitely cleaning is really bad especially the bathroom was too dirty hair everywhere toilet not properly cleaned even a dirty toilet brush was left like that the window of the room was not closing properly we asked front desk to send cleaning again when we were back nothing had changed we called front desk again they proposed to change the room and they gave us a smaller room it was late at night so we just accepted only when we placed comments on trip advisor we could take the attention of the hotel i would go for one of the nh hotels next time they are definitely better located
