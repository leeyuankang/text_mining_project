the only downside was that the hot water pot in my room was dirty with thick stains inside not sure this is normal but i did find the same in some hotels on my previous travels so make sure to check the hot water pot before using it the idea of having the espresso machine in the room is awesome but i was shocked when i found used capsule still inside the machine
