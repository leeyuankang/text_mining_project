staff in the reception talked with a blank expressionless face especially the last day when i checked out i asked for invoice and the girl told me that they can not offer me one because the rooms are prepaid and i feel so strange and asked for a reason the girl said there was no reason and if i need one i shall ask booking for it so i had to go to the guest relation again and they offered me immediately it is really ridiculous and the facilities in the bathroom are have different problems like the water tap was dripping in room the breakfast was too poor really didn t worth euro per person
