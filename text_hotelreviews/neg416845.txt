had a superior room only room i saw smaller so far was in ibis wardrobe small and shallow no place to hang a coat or a dress pillows just a non existant fluff shower doors impossible to close wobbly shower head crusted with lime scale that had water spraying in all directions at least there was a shower cap to salvage that situation rude and incredibly slow waitresses at the bar lounge were a perfect end to the stay
