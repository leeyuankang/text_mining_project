we upgraded to a suite having not been away without the kids for almost year the sofa in the room was well worn and i could not sit on it comfortably upon arrival the shower drain was blocked and dirty looking so we had to call maintenance to fix it surely the cleaner should have noticed this there was no remote control for the tv and when we got one it was held together with black tape and would not operate from the bed there were stains on the walls also i did make a complaint during our stay and got a fruit basket delivered to our room i think we ate orange from it plain and simple its just not good enough for the price we paid and expect from a star hotel
