my room was number and it was quite impossible for any guest to locate there following the signs i asked for help and they showed it to me explaining that the building was not constructed as a hotel hence like a labyrinth the first time trying to find there was weirdly entertaining as the hotel looked more and more like the set of the shining with all those seemingly aimless spaces rooms and doors it looked more like a theme park with a haunted hotel concept also on the second day and while checking out it was quite like a test against madness trying to figure my way in and out not finding a bottle opener and the tv remote in the room combined with this lost theme upon my arrival which made my stay fun in a twisted way i don t know if the entertainment problem of finding the room or the way out was unique only to some rooms but it can also be dangerous for people who have mental issues also i don t see how that kind of space can be evacuated in case of need if not intentional the lost theme may be degraded a bit by actually working on how better to indicate locations to guests
