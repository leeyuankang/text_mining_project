not having a view was disappointing we were given no directions to our room and it was very difficult to find the cleaner kept opening the very top windows using a ladder and we had huge difficulty closing them it was very cold during our stay when we approached someone about heating he was not very helpful the directions given online re how to find it from centraal were difficult to follow and a much longer walk than suggested especially in the rain
