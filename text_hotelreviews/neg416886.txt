we are very unhappy with this hotel which is mentioned as a stars but which is not reliable at all we booked rooms through booking finally when we leaved the hotel we paid a higher price than planned on the reservation because we requested an additional bed in one room and finally we discovered one week later that they used our credit card number for another invoice of euros without asking or sending any information justifying this new invoice our bank is investigating but it looks like they invoiced the breakfast which was included in the booking price this hotel is really a shame
