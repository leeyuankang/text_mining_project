we was put in the basement originally even tho requested upper floor this room was not not able to open a window and no air conditioning managed to move rooms in the morning again no air conditioning working no windows could open could not call to reception from the room as the phone had no markings detailing how the electric curtains did not work unless you used the box on the wall staff were rude and to finish it off my husband went to complain ended up stuck in the lift which is frightenening for anyone and when he finally got out the lift with the help of a cleaner he was distressed the reception then caked the police in him for being aggressive they then kicked us out of the hotel poor management service
