this is the year we have stayed at this hotel and on all previous occasions the service has been superb however this year the younger staff didn t seen interested in customer service at all and that was very evident and disappointing for example i am recovering from a broken leg when we had checked out i was waiting at the foot of the steps to the hotel for my fianc e to bring down a rather heavy suitcase one staff member came down the stairs wished us good morning and went on with his business it would not have delayed him if he had carried the case down steps the hotel is beginning to appear expensive for what you get compared to comparable hotels
