after a long flight the receptionist told us that we did not have two bedrooms next to each other given we had booked the rooms about months ago i was disappointed by this to then get told that the only way we could get rooms next to each other on the same floor was to upgrade to suites at a further of the initial cost take it or leave it was adding insult to injury when travelling with youngish kids you don t want to be on different floors so we paid the price nobody could then show us to the rooms and oddly the rooms numbers aren t sequential i suspect because the hotel is a converted office building non of the above is star hotel standard and i won t be staying there again
