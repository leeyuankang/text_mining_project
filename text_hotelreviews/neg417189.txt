grit in the spinach for breakfast unacceptable it was also the weekend of my girlfriends birthday and i wanted to buy some wine to take up to the room to drink when we got to it the lady reassured us that there was a little something already in the room for us when we arrived we found that there were vouchers for cocktails on the bed but it wasnt what i had asked for so we had to either use the mini bar which didnt have a decent sized bottle of wine in or go back downstairs which we didnt want to do after we d just arrived the restaurant staff were terrible except the manager with the jacket and blonde hair who actually seemed like he was working quite hard there were guys who were clearly not interested in serving customers but were more concerned about looking busy as they were obviously under observation by their manager they had work facial expressions feigning concern but they were very unattentive even after several deliberate attempts to get some kind of service after waiting for too long the evening time came and i thought id try the restaurant noone to greet me when i arrived and so i sat at a vacant table and waited for service noone came i was then told after id stopped a member of staff that i hadnt been served because noone knew that iwas there get your act together please i paid almost euros for nights i feel like ive been completely ripped off and unless i receive a sincere apology and some degree of compensation for my experience there i will never ever go there again
