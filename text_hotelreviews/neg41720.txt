no mirror in the bedroom made drying hair a little difficult there was a mirror on the back of the wardrobe door but it was the wardrobe door that faced the door of the room so you couldn t plug the hairdryer in anywhere that would allow you to see the mirror v strange to be in a hotel that made it so difficult to get ready in the morning
