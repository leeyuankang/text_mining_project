my breakfast order was forgotten even though they was just two more tables occupied room service did not take in account that i had put up do not disturb sign and knocked on my door times waking me up when i complained i just got a that should not happen room service did not make up my room for the night witch the guests pay for i also got the wrong bag from the hotel when i got back to collect it after waiting on my flight home i had asked and got a later check out but on the check out day i could not get into my room since they closed my card at i would recommend to use this hotel when they have lots of guests since the service gets better if it s busy my first days there was not so many guests there and the staff seemed to take it as a day off or something
