proximity to centraal station meant it was very busy immediately outside the hotel therefore could be noisy as such we tried to cancel the second night but we were not allowed to although i d booked a cancellable option so wasn t happy about that as first time visitors to amsterdam no welcome pack or maps given to us which would have been helpful advice on the navigation of the hotel would have been helpful too we found out on the last day that they had a smoking room inside the premises and we had not been told my sister as a smoker had been outside in the rain for two nights and had been kindly given an umbrella don t understand why when she could have been inside all safe and sound shame the hotel couldn t be picked up and moved to a quieter area to match the upmarket facilities it has
