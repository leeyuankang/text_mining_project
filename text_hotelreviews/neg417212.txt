breakfast service was very poor so bad in fact we didn t end up bothering to have breakfast in the hotel the second morning of our stay they took up until we were almost ready to give up and leave to come take our order for eggs and coffee then the coffees took more than the eggs to make it to our table completely cold which told me they must ve been sitting around forever we got a halfhearted sorry by the end but by that point we were just done second point the cleaning staff on our floor rd spent at least minutes talking on full volume in the hallway outside our door at both nights which ruined our sleep considering the reputation and cost of the hotel we were not impressed and would probably not return as sleep quality and breakfast are quite important to us
