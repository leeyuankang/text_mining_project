the bathtub while a beautiful art object was not great for bathing no flat surfaces as the bottom was rounded made it hard to stand also nothing to grab to get out of the tub no rails and the edges of the tub are narrow and sharp fortunately the separate shower was excellent out room did not have a dresser there were no drawers for clothing just hangers in the closet
