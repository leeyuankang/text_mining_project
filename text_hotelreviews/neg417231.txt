breakfast for a star hotel the breakfast provided was a massive disappointment there was a small selection of food extremely poor service and not enough caffeine first of all you sit down and they take your order for eggs and hot drinks then there is the open continental buffet they would always advertise different cheese but at least of them would be finished in early hours of the breakfast and never be replaced meanwhile the simple coffee we ordered would take minutes to arrive and the eggs would take even longer this is because there is only one coffee machine and they make coffee for hundreds of guests from the same machine by the time they do yours your continental plate you prepared from the bar would be empty you would have a single cup of coffee and if you decide to drink it with the eggs it would turn freezing cold imagine chefs preparing egg based dishes individually for hundreds of people i simply can t understand why they can t put coffee machines at the bar so that guests can help themselves i mean fair enough if a waiter waitress brings your coffee some people probably think its more classy however if you are getting everything else from the buffet yourself then why not coffee too after complaining about the breakfast for days they finally gave us a voucher for cocktails which was a nice gesture
