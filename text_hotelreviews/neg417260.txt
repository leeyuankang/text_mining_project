well i was very disappointed in the spa facilities for the fact that they was not available and i would not have booked this hotel if i was warned about this the whole point for my stay here was to take advantage of the spa and to have a relaxed time here that unfortunately did not happen and i will be taking this further as it slightly ruined my time and i was there for a relaxing time
