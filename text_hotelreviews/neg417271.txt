the rooms did not have windows but drafts inquired about dvd player in the room prior to visit through booking com and the answer was that we could borrow at the reception however when asked upon arrival the reception told us that they do not have any dvd players we planned to stay in to watch dvds but we had to change our plans also the hotel staff visited our room so many times for nonrequested services refilling the mini bar fridge water supply etc i feel that they should have done those before we arrive especially refilling of the minibar and greet with complementary water once overall not really comfortable stay
