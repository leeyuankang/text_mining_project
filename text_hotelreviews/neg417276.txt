swimming pool is too small even though i was at the last floor i heard noise all the time not from the other rooms but from outside the isolation is bad i could sleep well but be aware of it the hotel says it s a art hotel but the decoration is cheap in some ways so it doesn t look like a five stars hotel i don t think the price worth it
