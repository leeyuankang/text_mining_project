we were quite unlucky with our reservation at check in we were told the hotel was fully booked my wife and i were quite disappointed after our trip and had the feeling the staff was not helping much to solve the issue they offered us an accomodation in a hotel next door which was not as nice for the first night at check out we were anyway asked to pay the full price for the nights as if we stayed at art otel which i still find rather twisted and offensive they then offered us two complimentary cocktails they must have thought that would have been enough to make up for the first nigth which we honestly took as a joke if you think free cocktails are enough in these cases well there s something we will never agree on customer satisfaction all in all not a nice experience first time in my life i was told our booking was scrap paper as they had meanwhile sold the room to someone else customer service really poor if your target is to be fun and creative you should also make sure your customers are almost always satisfied i would have appreciated a call to let me know about the issue in advance so that i could have cancelled the booking and reserved somewhere else when you are travelling you don t want others to decide for you where you gonna sleep you surely have loads of loyal customers and understandably so since yestarday you have lost returning customers
