we didn t sleep well two out of three nights due very loud music downstairs in the hotel bar there were some events going on one night till midnight and the next night till we complained but it didn t help actually i pay for a bed in a hotel to rest and sleep and not to get disturbed by awful noises it s an expensive hotel and not a youth hostel
