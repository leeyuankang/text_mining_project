they tried to book us into another hotel for first night as they had no rooms despite the fact it was pre paid i had confirmation they sorted it after a heated discussion breakfast was slow my order took over half an hour the waitress tried to blame it on their electronic system not working it was working for everyone else who were getting their orders within mins i then saw her finally write it down give it to the chef at checkout there were lots of things wrongfully added to our bill a telephone call didn t touch the phone other than when reception called me extras from the minibar i d had a water juice but told i d had other stuff too and best of all apparently i d ordered fast track tickets to van gough museum which was not correct either all items were taken off thankfully but i don t find it particularly acceptable to have to prove oneself innocent after spending for nights and especially when suffering from a sore neck from the really terrible bed pillows
