service at breakfast and in the bar a bit slow especially when they were busy on our second night we waited almost minutes for drinks because part of the bar was closed for a corporate event open plan bathroom no door to the toilet shower and bath just a partition wall to the bedroom pool and sauna area a bit disappointing no jacuzzi and the access was through the reception and bar
