we got a room after renovation and the bathroom and especially the toilet seat were dirty although we said it to the staff it was not cleaned until we got back to the room after dinner since it was late and we were tired from a long flight we cleaned it by ourselves the next days the lady at the reception was very empathic about our bad experience but her manager strangely could never find the time to talk to us about it they offered free breakfast as compensation but we had other plans for breakfast so it wasn t a possibility for us they didn t find anything else and just left it at that until we checked out after we returned home the manager found the time to contact us by mail and again offered something that was not relevant for us she just didn t bother answering us after we said it wasn t relevant we suggested to take the first night off the price since we checked in very late and all we did in the room was to clean it and sleep but she didn t even bother considering it the wifi was very slow the room is very small
