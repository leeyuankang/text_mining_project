checking in was relatively straightforward if a little cold we were shown a city map and some things to do but weren t shown to our room or shown the restaurant and pool facilities maybe that s being picky but i would expect special treatment from a especially as it was not overly busy the room looked nice from the surface but the toilet made a sound every hour i d put this down to bad plumbing the shower drain also stank of sewerage breakfast on the first morning was ok at first the fresh orange juice was nice but the service was terrible after being seated we were asked what we would like before receiving the menus after asking for the menu the waitress stood over us as if we were going to make a decision in that instant after asking for minutes we were ignored for then after calling back the waitress we ordered earl grey tea and an omelette with cheese tomato ham and onion what we received was generic tea and an omelette with nothing inside but absolutely covered in salt while my girlfriend was at the table and i was fetching some croissants as we couldn t order pancakes as we were ignored from that point on i was offered a coffee and my girlfriend requested that the waitress ask me when i return to the table after all the waitress never returned so we left just a terrible experience we didn t go to breakfast the next day as the amount of salt in my eggs made me feel sick so we paid for breakfast at a local cafe for very little money and not only was the food better but the waitress was attentive too upon checking out we were hit with a myriad of random charges for a room service tray next time i will ask them to bring it in their hands the room service tray was also never collected so i had to leave it outside the door it was still there after midnight by the way
