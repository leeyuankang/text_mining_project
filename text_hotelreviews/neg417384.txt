we did a mistake when booking the first time and selected the wrong week end with a non flexible rate no cancellation allowed when realising this we tried calling the hotel to move the reservation to the week before with the support of booking com the hotel management was not flexible and did not allow this obligating us to fully rebook for the week in question we do not understand this behaviour as this was a human mistake and our request was not to cancel the reservation but merely to move it no reason was given to us either for this reason i would not recommend this hotel which is a shame since our stay there was otherwise pleasant on the other negative side the spa was very small and full of people so a bit disappointing based on the pictures we saw of it on the whole i was expecting more of a star hotel
