the cleaniliness the availability of room service given that its a star hotel the staff can barge into your room anytime the maids will check the trash to find any existence of penalties that the hotel may benefit from e g even if they find pipe cleaning material in the trash they will claim u smoked the rooms and bathrooms are not five star material the quality is very poor and cheap the walls in the rooms are full of baggage scratches and poor quality black wallpaper the hotel may be five star but its definitely not star quality the maids are not good with cleaning rooms if you have allergies you will continuously suffer their is dust almost everywhere the maid will make minimum effort to clean the room just to make sure it looks tidy and rather not very clean the only thing good was the location otherwise do not waste your money stay in another star hotel would be more worth the cost
