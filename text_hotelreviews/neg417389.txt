evening meal menu was not varied enough overpriced and rather quirky there was the same set menu each night we stayed for nights and wanted to eat at least one evening meal for convenience at the hotel but once we had decided one night s menu didn t match our preferences there was no opportunity to eat on any other occasion as the menu was unchanging the hotel was a little parsimonious with the milk tea coffee supplies for making a drink in the room
