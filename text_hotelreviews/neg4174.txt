the hair dryer was attached to a unit that was positioned approximately feet away from the dressing table this is too far away when trying to style your hair fortunately i had taken my own hair dryer the lighting in the room was too low it would have been helpful to have had a bright light positioned by the dressing table to make drying of hair and putting on of make up that much easier
