the only things i could mention as a negative were the price it s not a cheap hotel to stay in by any means and the bed laying on it initially it felt super comfy but after a night i felt like i was not fully rested there could be two reasons for this a the most expensive single item of furniture in my home was the bed and it s soooo comfortable that it might be tricky for other beds to compete b it appears the beds had a topper on and although it has to be noted it s a very high quality topper i think after hours maybe the thickness was just not up to the job saying this i would say that maybe i am very particular with my comfort in bed and most people may find everything completely ok
