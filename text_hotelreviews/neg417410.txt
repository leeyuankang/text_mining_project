the rooms are no way five star this hotel is four stars at best its way overpriced and punching above its weight in my honest opinion the bedside tables were filthy with dust under the glass tops and the room looked battered and was starting to take on a more tired look the rooms are very basic no bedside lamps no alarm clock cheap looking flooring and not so great tiling in bathrooms one sink and a coffee machine for diy coffee addicts old looking mini bar with a boring variety of contents bed was comfy enough room was also freezing cold with air conditioning left on when we arrived great in summer not so great in march when its outside i don t mind spending money if i am going to get star treatment but this really is not the case with art hotel and i recommend somewhere else if your looking for somewhere more up market i do have high expectations however i expected much more from this hotel its just such a rip off for the cost i have stayed in better star hotels in france and spain than this place safe to say i will never stay there again
