poor room allocation we were given a poor room with poor bathroom even though we arrived at large group and many rooms blocked room changed next day groups we were refused yes i mean this access to the breakfast room due to a plus group of chinese and despite there being space for us instead we were forced into the bar and expected to sit on a bar stool or in a low settee neither acceptable for breakfast i had to ask quite forcefully to have a proper table moved from the group area into the bar bad grace and illogical as we could have sat at this table anyway it in the rooms we were unable to connect our ipad to the room system in the first room there was a wall socket but this didn t work despite your staff trying instead we were offered a free movie but this didn t work either in the second room there was no socket and so no way at all to use the tv unimpressive
