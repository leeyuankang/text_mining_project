the staff need serious training frankly they are young and need to understand the basic principles and application of hospitality management the check in process was not efficient and at the check out despite the fact that i provided my email address when i made the reservation online to which i received a reply from the property and when i checked in the hotel did not have my email address correct when i checked out also i requested to receive a copy of the hotel bill via email and had to request it from the property the following day in addition the staff interface at breakfast was frustrating i had to wait several minutes to be seated despite the fact that there were numerous tables that were unoccupied and then the service associated with ordering hot dishes and beverages at what is billed a buffet is overly controlled and slow
