on friday and saturday nights the hotel bar turns into a nightclub with a dj the music was so loud that when we i went down to reception to complain they could barely hear what i was saying the staff are well aware that the music can be heard in the rooms and most apologetic but are unable to do anything about it as having a dj has been approved by the hotel management this is appalling for a star hotel the music ended at we were told the bar closes at giving us sleep on our last night before we had to leave for the airport
