getting coffee during breakfast is really a big challenge i had to ask several times and each and every morning we stayed there they seem to have only one coffee machine somewhere in the back long commute times once you get the coffee however it is very good in taste and strength selection of breakfast items was good not sure about dining there but organization during breakfast really needs to improve as it was totally unstructured power outage at room while we were using the coffee machine i read that another couple had the same issue with that room looks like they did not do anything against it after the first time it was communicated fixing the power outage however was done within minutes i also need to mention the very loud music at the bar but this is up to you if you like it or not and the last point of improvement would be to have something like a night light the chances are very high that you push the wrong switch at night which then would fully illuminate the room and wake up others
