maybe we expected too much of a classical star service efficient but discrete respecting privacy cleanliness wasn t great the corridor quite dirty safe in the room full of fingerprints heating aircondition panel full of dust door of the minibar dusty as well turndown service in the evening was done by a very kind and friendly person but happened at about which usually is the time one prepares for dinner has a shower relaxes in general the personnel was keen to please and very friendly but a bit more of training would not hurt from our point of view being forced to greet everyone by shaking hands is unusual but yet can be accepted if the proper service follows in a hotel an offer to help with luggage should go without saying being sent up to the room without being accompanied would have been ok if we wouldn t have found the assigned room occupied check in procedure was quite long and got even longer after that incident we would have liked to have an aperitif or after dinner drink at the bar but music was annoyingly loud the bar was more of a disco so we refrained check out was quick partially maybe because of the quite high deposit for extras taken in advance not really but understandable in their position not a bad stay in total but not great either is definitely not fulfilled
