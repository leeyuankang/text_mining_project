there were a couple of areas where the art otel could improve we stayed for nights and the days the room was not replenished properly we had to request to have new toilet rolls and coffee making facilities the food in the restaurant was average to be generous i had pasta that was so al dented it was almost crunchy breakfast was also terrible the eggs and bacon were tepid as was the coffee but the fruit salad yoghurt and pastries were lovely
