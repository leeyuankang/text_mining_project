the hotel tries really hard to be a contemporary boutique hotel but in my opinion it falls a bit short i m sure some of these were teething issues but the desk was really small and the large desk lamp took up most of the usable space the wifi didn t work although this was corrected several hours later it would have been nice to have blinds as well as curtains so i could let light in without being exposed to the neighbours not sure what s going on with the cheap looking carpet on the walls in the hallways or as skirting boards in the rooms
