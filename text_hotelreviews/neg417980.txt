actually i do not have things i did not like in this hotel only if can be better although the location is really strategist still in city centre and most excursion tour depart point is just in front the hotel but it will be more perfect if can be more central for more however this won t be a problem since can buy tram tickets package or if you like to walk around like my partner and myself the walks in city centre is enjoyable
