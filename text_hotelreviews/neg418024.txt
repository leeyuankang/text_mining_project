turkish bath was still under construction this was extremely annoying because i booked my stay so that i can use this facility to relax after a long day i wanted to complain to reception but decide that there wasn t much point i travel to amsterdam regularly and normally check into the doubletree so it would be nice if barbizon palace could redeem itself by compensating me in some way to entice me to stay the next time i visit the city
