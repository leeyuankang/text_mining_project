was a little shocked to find out my booking cost over more than the price quoted on arrival due to city tax which i knew nothing about maybe my fault for not realising but that s a bit of a jump in price and i never paid it last time i was in amsterdam first room had balcony door wide open and the room was freezing and we couldn t close the door so they changed us room was disappointed there was no baths in the rooms even though online it says bath showers and i sent a request to the hotel to have a room with a bath so i feel i should of got a reply stating they don t have baths so i didn t have to deal with disappointment on arrival they only have baths in the suite rooms apparently ordered breakfast to the room and it was the completely wrong breakfast and freezing i know mistakes happen but it s a little annoying when your starving and a vegetarian and got a plate of cold sausages and bacon that wasn t ordered
