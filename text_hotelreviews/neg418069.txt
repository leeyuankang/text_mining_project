the room was very cold when we arrived it took us times to get the staff to fix it they referred to economy purposes the heating in the room only works when the a c is on it takes minutes to get the temperature to a reasonable level and when you live the room it cools down very quickly only at the end of our stay it was warm inside wi fi in the room was also extremeiy unstable we asked it too be fixed they checked the room and restarted the modem but it didn t help i stayed many times at nh hotels including this one and it was my first negative experience overall i cannot recommend the hotel for business travellers as you might need to spend too much on sorting out technical stuff there
