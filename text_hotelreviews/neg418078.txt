paid for upgrade went up to room to find it in a mess gave us another and it was half the size of the previous room had to wait around for first room to be cleaned and we didn t arrive early breakfast was ok no glasses for orange juice no bowls for cereal had to go searching for a cup of tea not great for a five star hotel when your paying that little bit extra for good service
