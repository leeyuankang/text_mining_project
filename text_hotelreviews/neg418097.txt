misleading photos of premier room types do not book this room type and expect to get what is pictured here on booking com there is only one room that looks like that i was told slamming doors thumps thuds and booms from within the hotel is quite disturbing and happens constantly at any hour of the day or night some rooms have soundproofed windows and some do not i asked for a quiet room and was given a room without any soundproofing that was directly facing an irish pub yes it was disturbing and quite insulting beware of this hotel if indeed you must stay here otherwise find something else there are plenty of other options this hotel is just not worth the high price for any type of discerning person and seems to be for budget type tourists and younger backpacker types stay away from room
