the beds are very hard i booked a superior double i got a first floor room overlooking the side street full of bars which was really noisy until i got this after being moved from a third floor inner room which was twin instead of double i m glad i only had nights stay here i booked a canal cruise in the hotel paid pp i expected a quality boat cruise to match the hotel instead we were on one of the smallest boats on the canal the company office mins from the hotel offers the same cruise for that just added insult to injury
