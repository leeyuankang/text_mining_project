i booked on the internet and when arrived around the room was not ready as i requested for double bed so i waited till and i was surprised that i was given room in the underground where you take stairs to reach the toilet inside the room it was actually funny i have never seen it before again i asked for another room and i was given twin bed which was against my request however i accepted because i was tired the second day we went out and when we came back we expected the room to be clean nothing was clean even the cups were still dirty i spoke to the reception and all what they say is sorry sir i dialed the duty manager to tell him about my concerns but he wasn t helpful at all so i figured out that this hotel is low class hotel which they don t really look after their guests i left very disappointed
