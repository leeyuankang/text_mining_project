the breakfast was not wow for the money and if you call for information regarding in room dining try to avoid rush hours i have called to ask what was included in one the breakfast options and the lady told me that she did not know and to call later if i have questions about the menu since she was receiving a lot of more calls to order from other passengers not polite at all resulting in me going to the known starbucks option at the train station a bit noisy even at the upper floor
