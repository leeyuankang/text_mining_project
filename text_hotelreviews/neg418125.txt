check in was very bad i checked in at and was told my room was not ready and need went out for a stroll and returned later and room was still not ready and has to wait for another long with the good check in desk staff chasing but the process took just too long noticed there was no tv remote control in my room and had to call three times and waited for hours before someone came to my room to give me a remote control and that was after i had mentioned my fourth call i will want to speak to the manager in charge if there is still no response from them
