noise levels were ridiculous we had to keep checking the windows were closed as it felt like people were partying in our room until weekend and weekday nights spoke to staff who said next time we should ask for an inside room as it won t be as loud you then have the noise of every bin man and road sweeper from onwards so don t expect much sleep if staying in this hotel fine if you re planning on staying out partying until and won t get woken up in the morning
