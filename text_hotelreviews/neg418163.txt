i had booked my room online for a superior double room a good few weeks ago for a birthday present for my boyfriend when we arrived from our delayed flight the staff had to tell us that our room was gone tat use had over booked and all they had was two single rooms we had to be put up in one of your other hotels which was a bit disappointing as i had heard so much good things about ur hotel n was the reason why i booked there but staff wer very helpful and done what they could and checked us back in again the next night
