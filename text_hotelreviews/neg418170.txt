upon arrival we were provided with a room facing the lobby with no possibility of letting fresh air in as we opened the door to the room a clear odor hit us after complaining at the reception we were provided with an exterior room where we could open one window for a few cm in order to let fresh air in on the second day we were simply ignored by the cleaning services and only on the third day after complaining we received fresh towels which really did not feel or look fresh the use of the bathroom sink came with a distinct sewage smell every time we tried to use it the cleaning of the bathroom was superficial the interest and friendliness of the reception staff also has a lot of room for improvement especially given the number of stars held by the hotel
