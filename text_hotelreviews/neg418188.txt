the front disk didn t have my booking or my name in their system i had to show my hard copy of the booking com reservation until they solve this issue because of this my early request to have connected rooms through booking com was lost i had to wait until the next day to be moved to connected rooms also the front disk considered my rooms as no breakfast rooms i had to show them the evidence hard copy of my booking com confirmation that breakfast is included in the reservation which is very strange didn t happen in any hotel before
