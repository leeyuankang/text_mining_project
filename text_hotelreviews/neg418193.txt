staff was not helpful the lady ms mariej purposely checked me into single room although i had booked for double room superior room upon confronting her she informed me that since i am single she decided to put me into single room i asked her what if i had booked a king suite and paid times of the amount would she still put me into single room since i am single and well not to my surprise her response was yes eventually after i told her that i wanted the double room which i booked for and paid or to refund my payment she later on moved me into the room which i had booked for this was not expected from a five star hotel though
