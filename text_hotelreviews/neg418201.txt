i traveled with my young children and they did not have any rooms for us in the hotel so they put us in their hotel apartments across the road the apartments are terrible stinky noisy and old i stayed there for one night and had an argument with the reception to put us in the hotel where we had actually booked for when it was finally done staff not friendly and after wasting one night and climbing staircases flights no lifts in the apartment building with total suitcases the main hotel is very nice and we then enjoyed our rooms breakfast buffet is too expensive euros pp
