i booked a superior room for nights and the ac didn t work so i had to change the room at o clock in the morning and they downgraded me to smaller room with out any compensation even though when i asked to extend my stay they wanted to charge me with the regular daily rate which was higher than booking i stayed a total of nights and they never changed the bed sheet or bellow case the house keeping is very poor
