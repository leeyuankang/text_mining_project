i had to wake up early in the morning one of the staff who came to my room to bring some water was informed to give me a wake up call fortunately i did not rely on them otherwise i could have missed my train and subsequently my flight to rome i informed them at reception but nobody could reply to me i am confident that the guy who just took service at night did his job as he promised to do so immediately i made a request for an early check in nobody from the hotel replied to me
