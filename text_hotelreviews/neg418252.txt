we had the room at the first floor and just next to a busy street it was almost impossible to sleep room number due to noise coming from the street you can actually hear the people talk this room should not be sold to anyone and when we wanted to change the room they could not because the hotel was full but they were all aware of the problem with the room just poor decision from management to sell that room despite the expected bad experience from guests
