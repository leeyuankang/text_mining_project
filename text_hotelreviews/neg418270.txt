for the price of the hotel its scandalous that the room wifi was so poor that it was useless even the kind offer of a free upgrade was also useless as that didn t do much either if you re expecting business clientele this is not acceptable would be a good idea to keep some recharging leads for silly guests who forget theirs don t have the rooms with canal view if noise from pubs and parties will annoy you at night
