more staff at check in checkout there was a queue of other guests waiting when we checked in through the concierge we organised a shuttle bus to take us to the airport we were at reception well before departure time but the bus took off without us so we took a taxi the excuse from the hotel was that they do not manage the bus service we wanted to eat in the hotel restaurant but it was booked for a private function there were no other alternatives apart from room service we did not want to go out
