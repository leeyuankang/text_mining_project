if you are tall and or wide you may have trouble in this hotel i am and the showerhead was not very far from the top of my head when i was in the bathroom it was very short and the elevator it s small even for for me my partner and i had two small luggages two backpacks and an additional bag this is about as much as that elevator could hold the internet was strange it worked fine until a certain point during the night i think and then our devices would have trouble connecting due to some kind of failed ip configuration the shower is a little odd i m not quite sure if there s a way to not get water on the floor the little glass divider pivots on a hinge so do not lean on it i would have preferred to have a warmer room oddly enough the first night seemed very warm and every subsequent night seemed very cold
