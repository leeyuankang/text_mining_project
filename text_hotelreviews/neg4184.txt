although the staff were nice they screwed our meal orders up twice our room was really nice the first night large room with a window we decided to come back and stay a second night but got put in a terrible room very small the air conditioning didn t work so we had to open all the windows in the middle of winter to keep it cool there was a bank of about air conditioning units right outside our window so it was super noisy the bathroom stunk of mold and lynx deodorant the drains were blocked and the bed was terrible it was super hard and super creaky which woke us up a lot in the night between the creaky bed and the air conditioning units outside the stuffy heat and the mouldy stench we didn t have a very good sleep at all i think maybe we stayed in an upgraded room the first night without knowing an upgrade was offered to us the second night for pounds but we didn t think we needed it and assumed we d have a similar room as the previous night but we definitely didnt on a different topic the adult movie channel was terrible super fetishy chin strap ons surgical instruments lots of pvc and horrible badly lit ugly people having gross sex not my cup tea but if you re into that kind of stuff you ll love this place
