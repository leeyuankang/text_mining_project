overall we were unimpressed with our deluxe room which had a view of a wall it was large about square meters but the space was more rustic without luxury touches we were very surprised that this star hotel had no evening turn down service we travel light having one carry on each for a week vacation even so we though the storage was poor consisting of one small wardrobe with small drawers plus enough space to hang or articles the only place to sit was on the one very uncomfortable settee an awkward corner writing desk had just enough surface for the kettle french press cups saucers etc a nespresso would be much better suited for the space we value quiet so noticed that the soundproofing between floors was poor heard furniture moving and normal conversations on the other hand the soundproofing was excellent against outdoor noise
