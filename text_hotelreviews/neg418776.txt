very very small bedroom view out of the tiny window was of a drainpipe no bath difficult to plug in the kettle and make a drink in the limited space strange smell on the landing shower leaked water all over the bathroom floor so was a slipping hazard not much hanging space told there was a free boat but it was booked up in advance nice hotel but overpriced for what we got have stayed in better star hotels and at less cost in other european major cities
