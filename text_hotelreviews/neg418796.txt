found the check in chaotic and rather uncaring it was so odd to be given a map of the property by the front desk instead of being escorted to the room i only say this as the hotel is made up of many different old homes and is a bit of a labyrinth to the jet lagged and newly arrived they are so busy i can t help but think the customer service is under pressure with so many other fine hotels in the area i do hope they work on this as in the rest of the hotel we had excellent service
