the service is fine but not great for a star hotel the hotel is made of several townhouses that were merged into this quaint yet fancy hotel some rooms are located in between floors which means you may have to go up and down some stairs to reach yours considering this in a star accomodation i would expect to have a bellman to carry my heavy luggage and not have to do it myself the bathroom is not equiped with a bath only a shower the breakfast was a disappointment to us and so was the bar
