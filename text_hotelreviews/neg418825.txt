a five star hotel normally has two chambermaid visits per day as opposed to a four star this one had only one visit the room was slightly ugly due to dark grey walls a porthole which could not be covered between the bathroom toilet and the room no privacy a hard to close door for the bathroom drafty windows too narrow curtains which could not mask the streetlight properly strange shapes of furniture the hotel has a funky feel rather than luxury feel which might be good for a three to four star hotel but not for a five star one
