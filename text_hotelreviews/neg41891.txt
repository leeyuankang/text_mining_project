we stayed nights in a family room people and our room was not cleaned for a day when i complained to the staff the staff did not even apologise i wasn t angry at all at first but their careless reaction made me very furious and just asked if i need anything because they cannot clean my room anymore since it was late in the evening i just asked for some towels as my family just came back and we wanted to rest but after of waiting no one brought any towels i had to actually come to the reception and ask for the towels myself anyhow the communication and the way the staff handled the situation was very unprofessional for a reputable hotel like marriott also it was sometimes hard to communicate with both the reception staff and the restaurant since most of the staff do not speak fluent english moreover the breakfast was the same everyday for the three days that we stayed it is very difficult to order tea coffee because all the staff are busy our tea came when we already finished breakfast i think with the amount of money my family have paid we could have received a better service at another hotel this was a rather unpleasant stay
