the fact that two people sorted out our checking in and failed to tell me we were room only as i never book that as part of my daughters hotel experience is the breakfast and i feel i paid a lot of money just to sleep there and it spoiled my daughters birthday treat as i was not going to spend another more that day just for breakfast so it made me very angry and i don t think i shall go there again i was also not very impressed that i got up early on the sunday morning to go swimming and half the pool was cordoned off for swimming lessons as it doesn t tell you about it anywhere but then i could have stayed in bed longer as i never got breakfast anyway i gave my custom to costa instead
