while it is in the quaint and central grachtengordel or horseshoe shaped streets along the canals the hotel is a few blocks away from the upscale restaurants and stores it is in a neighbourhood that almost verges on seedy further the rooms are quite noisy at night on the first and second floors the fourth floor is quieter finally the rooms and bathrooms are serviceable but not attractive the rooms walls are painted a stark white that shows the many scuff marks that guests and service personnel have left behind the furniture is a matching set but that is all that can be said about it the rooms and bathrooms lack charm and look like they were done up in the eighties the hotel dining room is quite chic they ought to get that decorator to design the rooms
