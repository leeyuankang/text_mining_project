we were in room which although it was right on the corner and overlooking the canal and street was very noisy and bright they had very heavy drapes that did help some the bathroom was so bright that you needed no light at all at night and we had to keep the door closed against the light the main problem is that the large lights that were shining on the hotel also were shining into the room i d suggest a higher floor
