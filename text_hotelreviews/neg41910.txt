the fact that when you arrive the marriott charge you an extra per night holding fee the hilton don t do this and nowhere on your website or theirs does it explain this so we had to give them of our spending money and didn t get it back until we got home disgusting we were also informed on check in that they were maintaining other rooms and building work was taking place so nothing but drilling and banging again nothing on their website about this
