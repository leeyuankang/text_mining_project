seen a rat twice in the breakfast room the staff explained that it s because it s cold nowadays and there is an old building next to it but surely there isn t anything in the room it was very clean the breakfast is abit expensive might consider lowering the price to about also it s very limited and always the same things maybe you get annoyed with the noise at night for me i didn t find difficulty sleeping i could hear sound from the street but it wasn t too loud
