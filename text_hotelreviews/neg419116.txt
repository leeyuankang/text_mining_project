poor value for money bath is old fashioned the shower was leaking all the time out of the bath tub i fixed it myself but kept leaking booked a comfort double room and asked for a room with a good view a month in advance i was told i should have paid more to guarantee a canal view one so i decided to not going fo it but ended up in a small double with an awful view something like and internal courtyard i paid around euro for two nights and unfortunately they were not worth it for having a room like that only small shower towels are provided and face ones if i haven t visited other hotels of the same range price in other countries this last month i would have probably rated the hotel better but i think it s too expensive for what it has been offered friendly staff at least
