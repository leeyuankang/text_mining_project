i didnt like that a card pre authorisation may be taken although this was pay nothing till you get there with free cancelation weeks before i arrived they took nights payment without warning when i challenged this i was told they had not taken it in a couldnt care less attitude it was just put on hold and if i wasnt happy i could cancel and the money would be realeased back to me in days i had booked well in advance and could not risk cancelling in case another hotel did they same thing before i got my money back they told me they would release the funds back into my account the day i arrived if i didnt cancel weeks later the money appeared in my account the superior room was a waste of time space and money although there were chairs with a table there was a large space unoccupied that was useless i would reccomend you go for the comfortable double and to watch out for money taken out your account without warning the gym was what i would describe as a single room
