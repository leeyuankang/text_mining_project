taxi service from hotel we have never felt so pressurised to use someone s service with whom we never made any contract or agreement not even verbally as i did not place the phone call to the taxi company the receptionist did after asking for taxi at the reception i immediately requested to cancel it as it would take more time to get there than the uber and we had to rush to the airport the taxi ordered showed up at the same time as our uber driver i was verbally attacked by the taxi driver who shouted who did you order first the uber or taxi he was unfortunately happily backed up by manager or supervisor of the hotel who decided to get her claws out saying it was illegal and that i made her ring a cab and so was required to use his service for christ s sake please check eu consumer law and have a good read about the right of cancellation you should be ashamed of this havoc you created in your street you blocked your busy road for a good five minutes you shouted at a customer who spent for nights at your hotel and most importantly who had no time to waste being a victim of this appalling scene when in a hurry to get to the airport you are only accommodating when it is for your own interest that pathetic behaviour only appeared to us as utter disrespect to my partner myself and the uber driver on our last day i do not recommend using the desk service as despite amsterdam being very liberal you may feel deprived of your basic customer rights
