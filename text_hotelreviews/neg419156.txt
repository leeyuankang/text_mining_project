did not like the fact that as residents could not get a meal in the hotel on night of arrival apparently restaurant fully booked albeit this could be construed as a positive sign also were unable to get a drink upon our return to hotel on sunday night about as we were told till had been counted and closed when reminded that we were residents we still were not served basically bed time restaurant serves as bar and vice versa so not ideal if restaurant busy breakfasts were disorganised staff were not attentive food options were slow to be topped up if at all when running down generally lacking conversations and noise from other rooms can be clearly heard from within own room which was strange and intrusive for what you get pretty expensive
