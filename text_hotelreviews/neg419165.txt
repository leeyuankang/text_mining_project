it looks like an old american hotel of the s with damaged dark carpet and wood furnitures extremely noisy i could hear my neighbours flushing at the breakfast i was asked to sign even before i was sitting on the table i even did a remark to the guy there the paroxysm is that i forgot my electric toothbrush there i called them to ask if they could send it back to me they were friendly on the phone and of course said yes surprise when days after i receive an email saying that they couldnt use my credit card to pay the mailing to my address crazy stingy poor service and furnitures nothing to recommend definitely not
