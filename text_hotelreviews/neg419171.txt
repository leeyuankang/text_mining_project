the hotel has policy rules which are not published at booking com neither written anywhere in the hotel premises or document they just claim that a verbal rule expressed by the staff post factun is enforceable the argument guest is not allowed because i say so now seems really strange i had to argue for mins and i rented the best room the penthouse in the hotel another inconvenience was the fact that you can t enter the hotel when the receptionist is out they simply lock the entrance and make you wait until the receptionist is back the reason they provide is security one would wonder what kind of incidents they might faced and if the hotel is not secure hire a security guard or implement a security system when the room costs a night it seems a reasonable investment
