run down hotel the room view was horrendous overlooking the back service entrance thin walls could hear the neighbors and some construction going on early in the morning did not like the fact that i had to leave my key at the reception i was told it is for security reasons and was provided a card with which to identify myself but was asked only once for it and the other times there were people at the reception i have not seen before that did not bother asking for it security i think not
