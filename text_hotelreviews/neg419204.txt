some rooms should be illegal to sleep in the noise of the street is terrible both day and night i checked in at pm exhausted after a long flight and had to wait for another hour so that the staff will try and fix the key that didn t work after a long hour of waiting i was asked to go to the staff every time i wanted to enter the room because the key still doesn t work they fixed it only the next day the sheets and the carpet were torn and stained the sink was broken the whole floor was smelly even though there is an elevator you still have to take too many stairs there were dead bugs on the curtains that probably have been dead for a while flies and sorts of bugs in the room staff weren t very nice and even a bit rude
