there was a water leak in the bathroom above us and we had to move room we were very tactfully moved to the junior suite room which was lovely as it over looks the canal and it s a beautiful room but there are steps to go up to the room so with lots of luggage it might be a problem for some however if it wasn t for this there would be nothing to complain about
