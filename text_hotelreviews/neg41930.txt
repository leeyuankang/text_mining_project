the room was described as having a balcony ours had a rail with pipes and not even a window to open we were on the roof so had a curved window and they were very dirty and mouldy looking in parts the pool was very shallow at the end so made it quite difficult to swim lengths you also had to climb down some very tricky curved stairs to get to the pool once you had changed so many people just came through the main doors and went back to their rooms to shower the restaraunt also needed some more staff on the sunday as they were struggling to keep up with the customers as mondays breakfast was definitely better though one waiter was struggling with his english as i ended up with decaffe coffee instead of decaffe tea
