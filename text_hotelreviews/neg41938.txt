service in restaurant and at breakfast time was awful we stayed for nights and every morning we had to almost beg for a hot drink we were never approached by a staff member asking if we d like a drink there were nowhere near enough staff present at breakfast and you had to try and find one and get them to get a hot drink for you it was truly the worst breakfast service i ve ever experienced i ve stayed at the maida vale marriot just up the road too and breakfast there was top drawer so don t know why this was so bad apart from this hotel is great maybe stay room only
