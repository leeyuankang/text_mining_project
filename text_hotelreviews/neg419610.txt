my booking was for two rooms with canal view but one of the rooms is much smaller than the other room and hardly fits for guests and canal was hardly seen from this room even though i ve to pay same price for both rooms more attention need to be paid to room cleaning to cover dust removal out of furniture and surfaces and to check if provided towels is free from spots before putting in rooms solution need to be made to integrate the sink in private bathroom
