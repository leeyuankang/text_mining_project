i loved everything the only thing i didnt care for was at check out i asked to call a specific cab company as they said a return trip would be vs euro the staff member who was very nice said she could call another one and they ll all be he same price well it wasn t it was euro so that was annoying but i am not going to downgrade the wonderful experience we had over euro
