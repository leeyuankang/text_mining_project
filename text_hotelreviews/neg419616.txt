comparing to our first stay it seemed the staff was overwhelmed with corporate meetings and large tour groups that distracted from blue chip service example it took four requests to get a coffee refilled at breakfast it took two requests to get a newspaper delivered i don t remember either of these simple requests being an issue when we stayed there last year
