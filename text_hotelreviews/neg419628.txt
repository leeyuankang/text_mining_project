i am not fond of the shower being out in the room it s a lovely shower large and with excellent features so my only comment is simply that i prefer the shower and the basin closed i like the water closet separate but all in the same room just a personal preference one thing that could be done i like the option of pulling the curtain but would have made better use had it wrapped around the shower area with the counter basin oriented parallel to the shower instead giving more space to move around the bed as well but again it was a nice sized room and still very comfortable
