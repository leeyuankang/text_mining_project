the breakfast was very hard to understand they call it a buffet but you had to order hot food from the menu as well as go up and get some hot food so one morning i went up to get my eggs and then ask for bacon at the kitchen but by the time the bacon came my food was either cold or eaten on check in the receptionist said our room was her favorite room however the floor plans in the bedrooms show that every room was the same so seemed very rehearsed
