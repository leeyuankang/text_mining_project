confused whether the hotel is trying to be a chic trendy hotel or whether it is trying to be a fancy b b i am a fan of hyatt hotels and would stay at a hyatt hotel almost wherever i go however i have to say i had a much better experience at the nearby dylan than andaz when we arrived there was inadequate number of staff at the front we were checked in given our room keys and off we went we explored the room ourselves not that it was that difficult the room size is small and we did not have the most basic standard room at dylan i am not in any loyalty program and i was upgraded to a junior suite during my stay there a few months back and at andaz i am a platinum level member of the hyatt loyalty program no special treatment at all i had my stay stay in reservations and by mistake i booked the second half in a lower room type i was asked to pay to stay in the same room otherwise i have to move to the lower room type so much for being part of a loyalty program certainly feel so special room walls are quite thin you can hear when your neighbouring rooms are being serviced or when there is a big party taking place at a function room all the way on the ground floor
