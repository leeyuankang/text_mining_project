really didn t like the room this is not open plan living it s a small room with a toilet in a cupboard very disappointing and not good value for money on our return on the first day at the room still hadn t been cleaned if the staff hadn t been so pleasant i would not recommend this hotel it s getting more and more difficult to find a good quality hotel
