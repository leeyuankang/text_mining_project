all pillows are flat as pancakes you press your hand on them and it feels like there s only a bedsheet beneath you the room design with hand basin embedded into a table is trying too hard to be cool the rooms are small don t trust the booking com pictures for them why can t hotels rooms have pictures for a room vs the or shown why not a photosphere this isn t the only hotel where my expectations fell flat then onto the food i expect a decent spread for breakfast which unfortunately wasn t there it s a make to order kitchen which can slow things down on busy weekends the staff were friendly but check in was slow again in this day and age where i can buy a macbook pro in minutes why does it take minutes to get into a hotel room perhaps this place was just too cool for me
