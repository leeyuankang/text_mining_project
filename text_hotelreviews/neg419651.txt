the restaurant service was ridiculously slow and the waiters were simply inattentive and had to ask them for the same thing times in a row it took me over minutes to get a piece of toast with my meal i ordered a la carte also i had to ask for my bill at least times i felt like i spent an eternity waiting for everything i also booked a massage in the spa which was really terrible to be honest my friend who also booked a massage said hers was ok but not worth the price just to give you an idea of how my massage went i arrived and basically was led by a man which i was totally not expecting to do my massage then i reluctantly still stripped off and was under a very thin white sheet and the first thing this guy says is are you flexible and do you have your period i said no why extremely uncomfortable at this point and he said it had something to do with doing a massage that incorporates stretching anyway the massage was just not good and completely improvised not at all what i m used to incredibly disappointed about that i spent my time wishing the massage would end sooner rather than later also later i asked my friend and she did not get asked the same thing or experience anything at all like my massage
