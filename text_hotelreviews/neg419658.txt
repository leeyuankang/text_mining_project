we arrived at pm at the hotel we had asked for an early check in but they couldn t provide it for us no problem we came back at pm check in starts officially at pm but still only of rooms was ready all the luggage had been taken to one of the other rooms which was awaiting final inspection from the manager for cleanliness and that s why we couldn t go to it and although we called reception or times asking for the luggage they kept delaying it we waited for minutes for it in addition our friends who had the room were being sent from one room to another because nobody knew exactly which was their room so the reception staff is either inexperienced or overworked they smiled all the time though
