this may be booking com s issue more than the hotel however when i input our family and location for the search the price that appeared for this hotel was only for people and even though our child would have been free at most other places this hotel charged an additional eur per night therefore the original comparisons were incorrect when i tried to cancel our reservation based on this it was non refundable and no exception was made the ac is very loud and does not cool down the room very well the staff opened our windows for us the first day without putting in a mosquito net and we received over a dozen mosquito bites that night
