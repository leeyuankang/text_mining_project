if i was to nitpick the only thing i missed was being able to make a cup of tea in my room but that said the bar was a lovely area and i could easily buy a cup of delicious fresh ginger and lemon tea to take up the area is a little way out of the centre but once you ve got the hang of the tram system it s really not a problem at all and it is a nice peaceful neighbourhood
