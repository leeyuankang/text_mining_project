the short story there was literally nothing that i did not like the long story upon arrival in that dark and rather scary entrance i thought oh my god where the bleeps did i get myself a room this time and then ok zennnnnn take a deep breath you ll survive i got a few more moments like that like when getting this flashy youngster guiding me to the computer to check myself in and when arriving in this endless red carpeted hallway with white walls and same colour doors every three meters reminding me of a super funky futuristic version of a psychiatric ward then upon entering my room with flying saucer like coloured lighting over the toilet and shower and this huge tv screen over the bed saying welcome citizen martine but every detail i was taken aback by turned out to be actually quite agreeable i even slept like a baby which doesn t happen in many hotels i can tell you that much waking up with the trees hanging over my window helped and then the cosy every little corner looks different but it all feels like home ground floor where you can chose a different spot every day to have breakfast
