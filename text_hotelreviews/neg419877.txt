i checked in at about after a long day of traveling and work when i first entered the room i realized it was too cold and switched on the heating at two pm i woke up due to the cold temperature and called reception and asked them to help they said to keep waiting as the temperature could go up i called again minutes later and they offered a blanket and hot tea as the hotel was fully booked and they knew the room was cold i told them that i expected to get a reimbursement as the night i had paid for was a decent night of sleep in a four star hotel and citizen m was not being fair the guy replied that i could get the blanket and tea and he could not do more and said it was unfair that i was asking for a reimbursement to have a free night by justifying it with the fact that heating was not working horrible
