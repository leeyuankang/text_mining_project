very inconvenient location min ride by tram metro bus from the city center so if you enjoy commuting that s an option very small rooms in the picture they seem bigger very minimalistic style of the rooms not enough room to place your staff clothes no fridge the toilet and shower in the middle of the room eventually appeared to be inconvenient at all and the idea of it resembles a cattle barn it s not worth the money they ask for this place at all in the city center there are better options for lower prices with breakfast included could have had better time in amsterdam if the location was better
