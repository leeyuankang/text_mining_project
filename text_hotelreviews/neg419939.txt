weird self check in system on a first come first serve basis your room is only designated to you when you arrive so if you re the last one in you re left with what s available this was not said anywhere in hotel s details but a staff member said it when i was checking in the rooms are all the same but the one left for me was first floor next to huge construction site where work started also really price food for sale and quality of breakfast not in line with cost
