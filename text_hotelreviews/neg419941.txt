we found that there were hidden tricks behind some of the benefits this hotel offers for example the hotel offers a euro voucher to guests who choose not to get their room cleaned everyday but the small print outlines that you must spend this voucher the day you receive it so we returned one night approx to a voucher in our room to be told it was no longer valid as we were out all day we tried to not avail of this to avail you put a specific hanger on the door no hanger clean my room and our room was not cleaned despite us wanting new towels bedding this was slightly annoying as it would have been nice to come back to a clean room also a couple of days before arrival i got an email from the hotel saying i was entitled to a free welcome drink when i asked about this i was told to sign up to an email newsletter and to produce all reciepts i had for the room after doing this i was then told i would not be entitled to a drink as i booked through booking com also city tax which was not outlined at booking added euro to the price of the room breakfast seemed very overpriced euro per person for very basic breakfast i felt this was not value for money our charger for the ipad which controls the room lights etc was temperamental and would often not charge the tablet luckily we had an ipad charger however this would be inconvenient if you didnt have one
