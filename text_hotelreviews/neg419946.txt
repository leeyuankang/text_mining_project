there was no tea coffee facilities in the room which is a shame as we would have liked a warm cup of tea first thing in the morning as we get up frosted glass to the toilets could be made more opaque and the shower needs to be frosted glass as well to better preserve privacy these are just minor bits and bobs which did not affect our overall experience the hotel was phenomenal
