the sheer curtain that you can pull between the bathroom area and the bed should be thicker darker it wouldn t impact the room s open concept feel overall as you can pull it completely out of the way anyway i traveled alone so it was no problem but if i had been with another person a little more privacy and better blocking of light when you re in bed and someone is getting dressed would have been really good also even when staying alone a thicker curtain option would have better blocked the light coming in from under the room door via the hallway i found the shower to be much more comfortable than i expected however the toilet was much less comfortable than i expected it feels really small once you close the doors the check in process was terrible and apparently doesn t really work for booking com customers this needs to be fixed breakfast had a lot of options but the eggs were absolutely disgusting
