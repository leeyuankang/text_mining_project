room for adults but only chairs no bottled water in room and only tea sachets provided not what i expected from a hotel night of our stay was ruined by a group of all night party goers they shouted and sang slammed doors but worst of all they were smoking and we might as well have been too we had no windows open but the smell and smoke came into our room we were in a non smoking hotel eventually at security responded to our complaint asked them to be quieter not much good for us by that time i later spoke to two members of reception staff who apologised for our experience but they offered no reassurances or hotel policy on this just smiley faces so a little frustrating breakfast was included in our stay but we were informed that porridge eggs etc would have a charge of extra our first coffee or tea would be free after that a charge per cup the cups were tiny about worth the breakfast buffet was fine but all these extra charges seemed tight so all in all nice location but we came away sleep deprived smelling and choking on second hand smoke and no we won t be going back
