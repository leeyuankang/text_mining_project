on entering the extremely small room the first thing in front of me was the toilet with a shutter around it the shower had the same idea the width of the whole room was the size of the bed which touched wall to wall it was like a glorified hostel with an ipad having to control the lights and blinds with the ipad was more inconvenience than help i came for a weekend with my boyfriend and it was far from ideal the way the room was set out and certainly not romantic the mood lighting was ridiculous how can you create a nice atmosphere in a room with an exposed toilet sink and shower i found it comical the staff were friendly enough so i cannot fault them i would say this hotel is ok if you are travelling alone but it is not good value for money we could have stayed somewhere in the heart of amsterdam for the same money i would not recommend
