it s a five star hotel but does not feel like one too many people not enough staff it s too obvious they they are minimising cost and maximising benefit i even had to pay for a converter from a european plug to a british one that s being truly cheap i ve been to many other marriots and had a much better experience there the hotels seemed more like star hotels
