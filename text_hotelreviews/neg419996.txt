full airconditioned rooms with no chance to open a window or turn off ac i felt locked in toilet and shower are within the room which might be cool design wise but i hope it is only in single rooms if this would be a shared room with partner or friends it is well akward the tram is in front of the hotel and should offer a direct connection to the amsterdam center but the ride is annoying often delayed overcrowded and it takes half an hour and more no wonder is everyone riding bike
