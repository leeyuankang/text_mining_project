the room feels a bit claustrophobic without real windows there is a large glass but you cannot open it also a lot of tech for nothing you have to use a tablet to control everything from temperature to light to tv finally the shower and the wc in the middle of the room isn t a particularly cool choice it saves space the room is overall quite small but it s ugly and it feels like being inside the bathroom all the time in addition to little privacy when traveling with someone else the first thing you see when getting inside is the wc toilet in the middle of the room if you slalom between them you can find the bed and a closed window covered by layers of automatic blinds
