i ve seen a fair share of exposed bathrooms in hotel rooms but this was the most extreme so far upon entering the room you have to walk past the toilet seat enclosed in a transluscent floor to ceiling tube and the shower in a transparent tube the wash basin is open plan it was fine for one person but i can imagine it to be rather awkward if you are even if you re travelling with your partner it did feel a lot like i was sleeping in the bathroom and despite the high tech features like ipad controlled lights and blinds i felt it was worth much less than the per night it costed
