we didn t like the pillows very much but ofcourse that s very personal other than that these rooms are not suited for people who aren t couples or very close friends the shower is see through and the toilet doesn t cover any noise since they are both in the room covered in a glass capsule especially the toilet was not very pleasant we both had some stomach issues during the night because of something we ate and then to literally have to be in the room instead of in a bathroom wasn t comfortable at all
