the air conditioning was not working in my first room so after attempts to mend it i was eventually and without any fuss moved to another smaller one even there it was extremely noisy the hotel is undergoing refurbishment so perhaps one can forgive the fact that the bedrooms are currently looking very tired and worn luckily i was out most of the day but the noise from drilling was very loud next door and below my room in the morning i was shocked to be told that under a new rule there would be an early check in fee of but had to pay it as i had an appointment at on my arrival day needed to change before going to it at the end of my stay my bill was overcharged by some but this was double checked and corrected again without fuss all in all a disappointing stay at a hotel which i know well perhaps better to find somewhere else till it the renovations are finished
