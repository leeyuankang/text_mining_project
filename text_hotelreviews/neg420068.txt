very upset with this property not only was it very expensive but the super modern attempt at room design is outrageous you can t use the toilet without someone else in the room seeing you and the tech didn t work the shower dripped and we couldn t stop it and couldn t sleep i was promised a discount on my room but this was never given and i ve not had luck calling them just very poor really and wouldn t recommend this property
