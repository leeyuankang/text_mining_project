in room amenities were a bit sparse not having a kettle in the room is ridiculous the reason given is to encourage people to socialise in the lounge areas downstairs if that is the reason why then charge for a cup of tea why not make them free and let people socialise the philosophy doesn t quite add up but the profits do we spent over on nights away the room toilets are not great either hotel breaks are a good chance for romance in a long term relationship but seeing and hearing your spouse going to the toilet through some frosted glass is a bit of a mood killer no conditioner in the shower but types of shampoo seriously breakfast was tasty but expensive at each we found a bagel shop down the road that was half the price and had better coffee overall we paid a lot of money for a fancy hotel that didn t quite live up to the price the gimmicks were fun but in the end i d rather switch the lights on myself and have a truly private toilet and a coffee in bed
