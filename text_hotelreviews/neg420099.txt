there were of us booking the airport hotel only to find out there was a city hotel which was booked instead of the airport this was very upsetting we felt the websites were deceiving since of us did the same error later we went back to the website and retraced our steps and clearly felt the site was problematic make sure you book the correct location as it cost us euro in taxi fees
