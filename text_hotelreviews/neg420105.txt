air con made a racket during the night and you can t switch it off no hooks to hang your coat or bag up which was a pain bin in room was tiny not a fan of the toilet you can see far too much for my liking i got a bit claustrophobic by the end of the second day and we weren t in the room much can t open windows to get fresh air in there is nothing around the hotel other than flats and offices no tea coffee making facilities only two pillows
