nothing i didn t like just wished the ac would cool down quicker not a deal breaker whatsoever things were wonderful the hotel hospitality did recommend a restaurant called restaurant as but i would not recommend it it was when i walked over along with some others and we were rudely turned away with the excuse that they were all booked up they are open until and there was nobody inside all patrons were seated outside so it did not make sense totally shocked everyone is typically so wonderful in amsterdam
