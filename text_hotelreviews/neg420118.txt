the food selection at citizen m in amsterdam is poor there s not very much to choose from and the stuff that is available is strange food no normal food or any hot options simple food would have been much appreciated i do appreciate that it isn t in the uk but some uk foods would not go a miss in my opinion with the amount of british tourists that were there the rooms are nice and modern however the facilities in the rooms are pretty scarce fridge wardrobe ac for example could only go to degrees but the room felt w lot hotter than that which caused some discomfort it is a good thing the public transport in amsterdam is very good as the hotel is quite a while away from the town centre and there is nothing near by the hotel like shops restaurants coffee shops ect my girlfriend and i are very comfortable with each other so didn t mind much about the toilet and shower being in pods in the middle of the room but i imagine other couples who are more reserved would have an issue with that
