i liked pretty much everything about the venue and the rooms except when i arrived and was trying to check in it was my first time travelling solo i had changed all my money to euro and had most of it in cash i assumed there won t be any issues using cash and it will help me keep good track of my spending i had everything in check except the travel agent booking com failed to inform me that the hotel only allows checking in with cards i had arrived at the hotel at and i no banks were open my only option was to contact my parents back in london to transfer money to my account they did and it was quite a hassle because i had to call my bank and have it sorted out it was such a hassle and such a nuisance i have to point out that aside from that i did enjoy my stay it was clean quiet and the rooms are unique so it gave me a pleasant new experience
