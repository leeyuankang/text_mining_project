we came to this hotel for my birthday i wouldn t recommended it it had such potential but was let down majorly by the occurrences we experienced the balcony is very small but we didn t mind the room was nice we all had a shower ready for our night out and then realised non of our plugs worked when we went to use the hairdryer there isn t any description on what number to call to get reception so my friend went down with wet hair in her pjs and ask if it could be sorted they said someone would come up straight away later i then had to call off my mobile to the hotel to get someone to come up they said someone was on their way another went by then of my friends went down which resulted in the maintenance man coming up with them he then said if we plug in a few things at the same time the plugs will all go so advised us to only plug in one or two things so we had to rotate hairdryers chargers which was inconvenient we missed our table booking because this took so long then when we came back from our night out we ordered take away and never received it but the receptionist took our money we all came from different areas so was looking forward to a nice trip someone is meant to be getting back to me about the complaint we made still heard nothing
