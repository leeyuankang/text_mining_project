having the toilet and shower incorporated in the room is something we needed some time to get used to it also took us some time to get to terms with the technological controls of the room i imagine it would be quite a challenge for some people especially older i guess the whole thing is designed for younger people the room was rather small with little wardrobe space the breakfast was so expensive we didn t even try it
