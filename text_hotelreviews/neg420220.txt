the standard room for me was personally quite small and there was not a lot of room to move around the toilet was also in the middle of the room and offered no privacy at all if you are sharing the room although this cannot be changed as this is the layout of the room it is not a complaint it is just a word of warning to those who are travelling with friends partners that you cannot go to the toilet with any privacy unless you ask them to leave the room if not they will be able to hear everything lol through a frosted glass door just like the shower when i booked this hotel i could not see any pictures of the toilet in the room however please note the toilet is exactly the same as the shower but just on the other side with frosted glass if you would not be comfortable with this then i would not opt to choose this hotel however me and my partner didn t mind
