the space lighting tv and wall wall bed so hi tech but too capsule for a couple that wishes to sit somewhere except their bed it took us some extra time to decode the facilities and equipment using the i pad the shower knobs need weight lifters to switch them on off the clothing rack not enough for people unless they travel with what they wear and one shirt more the solarium style shower toilet makes the place a bit more noisy than it should be think the concept is brilliant could work better if the hotel improve the internal facilities and equipment
