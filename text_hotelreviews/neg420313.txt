the pluming is horrible you can hear everything and it sort of drips all night it needs sorting out also there is very little privacy just a curtain between bed and shower and a glass from the toilet definitely not somewhere you want to stay with someone you are not comfortable with the pluming is a nightmare it drops all night and everytime room has a shower you can hear the water running over your head not very nice and it needs sorting out
