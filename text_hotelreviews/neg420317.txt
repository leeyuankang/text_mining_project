we stayed in room and when we arrived there was a dirty tissue behind the mattress and what appeared to be dried mucus on the wall behind the bed we wasn t sure what it was but the next morning me and my partner woke up very sick and under the weather i m not sure if it was the people staying in the room before us that was ill but it could of been avoided if the bedsheets were changed maybe we didn t want to raise concern because we are a very shy couple and we can t really deal with confrontation
