there is no wardrobe in the room and very little space to leave toiletries etc the room felt cramped we practically lived out of our suitcases the toilet felt claustrophobic and the shower leaked twice we caught it in time and wiped it up with towels but my suitcase and shoes got wet i feel like the bedroom did not suit two people and is more suited to a solo traveler as the toilet cubicle is see through there is a curtain which provides some privacy but overall is not a very comfortable experience the hotel is not too close to the city centre
