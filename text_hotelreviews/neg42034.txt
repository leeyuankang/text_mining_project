we went away for my birthday week as we wanted to get away for some peace and quiet away from building work near our home we weren t informed that major work was currently going on in the hotel so obviously not happy with the sound of loud drilling and a lot of noise during our stay including heavy items being hurled into a skip right outside our room early in the morning our bed was itchy and uncomfortable we woke up with bites and itching all over we certainly wouldn t expect this from a marriott it was very frustrating not being able to get through to the correct staff on the telephone i must of phoned fifteen times to chase up the problem i either got cut off or told somebody would call me back which they didn t our bathroom smelled old and bad as a marriotts rewards member we stay in marriotts all over the country often through booking com up until now we have never felt physically sick due to the thought of bed bugs in any of them we were moved to an alternative room on our third night but it s just not acceptable that i spent my birthday week awake two nights running because of the quality of the bed then to be woken with the sound of building work in the mornings only last week i stayed at a marriott in birmingham and it was a perfect stay this marriott in regents park certainly wasn t the same
