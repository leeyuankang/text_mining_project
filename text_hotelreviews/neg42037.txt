the staff at reception didn t really seem like they knew what they were doing they took ages to check us in and they asked for the full amount of the stay upon arrival another annoyance was a member of staff knocked on our door early in the morning to ask if she could clean the room even though we didn t put the sign on the door to do so also they kept ringing the room for such little things also didn t appreciate the fact that one of the staff members was rude to my girlfriend
