quite small room and the windows do not open the i pad sometimes gets stuck when you try to adjust the tv volume the actual toilet and shower are in the room no delimitation whatsoever except for some glass doors that are rather transparent you can hear and even see your roommate partner when he goes to the bathroom which can bother you at times breakfast was quite basic and it was the same every day mainly scrambled eggs with bacon and tomatoes some salmon cheese gem cereals and strawberries
