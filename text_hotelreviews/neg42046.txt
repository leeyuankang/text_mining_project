the chairs in the bedroom s were so uncomfortable they were awful to sit on i cannot lie down in bed so spend a lot of the time sitting in the chair but not this one the only other thing was that the lighting in the room was not very good even with all the lights on it seemed quite dark but these little issues would not stop me from staying again as everything else was perfect and that is me nit picking because i cannot find anything else wrong
