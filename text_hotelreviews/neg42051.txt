i would like to see a cheaper breakfast alternative as it is quite expensive and not really an option for someone who just wants a small beakfast such as cereal or perhaps an omlette this would be my only issue as we had to go looking a cafe that suited us better we would have preffered to use the hotel for this facility it was slightly disappointing to see that after i had booked this hotel non refundable through booking com that i could have booked it slightly cheaper via hotels own website again not a fault with the hotel but do your homework on prices before booking
