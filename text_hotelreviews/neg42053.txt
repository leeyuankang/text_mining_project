have no hot drinks machine so guests had to wait for a hot drink the first thing i want is a coffee and i had to wait for it as did a lot of other people it would also take a little pressure off staff if not a machine why not offer a cafettiere or a pot of tea which would give cups to each guest not very sound proof windows found the outside noise disturbing
