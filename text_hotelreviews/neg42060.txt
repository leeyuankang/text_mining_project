we were kept waiting for our check in we were told they were late because the couple before us had booked a late check out which was totally irrelevant to us and which by inference suggested we were less important as we had not paid extra when we got to our room there were no towels so by the time we had reported that we had lost mins of our afternoon we were not even offered complimentary tea or coffee whilst we waited also when i rang the hotel to book a parking space i was told to contact justpark to reserve a space i was charged but when checking out found the hotel would have charged me i am annoyed that the receptionist cost me for incorrect advice not sure i would stay here again as you are certainly not made to feel you are important to the hotel
