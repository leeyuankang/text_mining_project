breakfast was a bit of a shambles we were given a table straight away but sat there for ages with no one coming to take out order i tried to catch the eyes of several waiting staff but they deliberately looked away when i put my hand up to indicate to one waitress that we needed assistant she actually scowled and was clearly muttering that we weren t at one of her tables and walked away so we left and bought pain au chocolat from budgens opposite saving so in the end i was not too sorry
