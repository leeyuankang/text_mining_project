i didn t mind that there was no wifi in the rooms although i feel that this should be said at check in and i didn t mind the construction works outside the hotel grounds i was there with my girlfriend for two days and we found this hotel on a deals website my complaint is that one of the hotel staff informed me that the first tube would be running at on the morning of my checkout a sunday when i checked out that morning i found that the local swiss cottage tube opens at this effectively made me nearly miss my flight as i instead had to get a taxi to victoria station to catch an airport express i would have expected the hotel staff to be a little more knowledgeable about their surroundings when i say i barely made my flight i had to sprint through the airport and was the last person to reach our gate
