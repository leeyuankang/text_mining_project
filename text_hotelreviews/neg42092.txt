the property is undergoing extensive renovations which we were not made aware of at the time of booking the reception and main entrance are a building site and the communal areas are confined to the conference rooms which are void of daylight my partner had planned on holding meetings during her stay in the communal areas but this was not possible and whilst her complaint was managed by a very nice manager the only resolution offered was limited access to the business lounge which being on the floor was not an ideal solution
