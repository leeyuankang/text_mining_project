renovation work in progress which made access to the hotel gloomy and unprepossessing but i understand that these should be finished soon a sunday morning swim in the pool which i had hoped would be relaxing was marred by the fact that there were children s lessons taking up a third of the pool happy to see kids enjoying themselves but it leaves little room for adult swimmers
