we arrived by boat an advertised option but there was no staff who could tell us where we could moor having made our way to reception not obvious or easy from the waterfront the receptionist said we could moor anywhere on the waterfront however just as we were finishing off the roping up a very disgruntled member of the restaurant staff came out to tell us that we couldn t moor there and would have to move not a particularly pleasant arrival at such a prestigious hotel
