it was slightly annoying when every morning the beds around the pool had towels placed on them to reserve them but yet the people were nowhere insight for hours so maybe a sign or something to say that you cannot reserve the beds and possibly more sunbeds we were there days and didn t get a single opportunity to sit around the pool but other than that which really isn t the hotel s fault more that people are just rude we had a lovely time and could not find any fault in the hotel
