we enjoyed our overall stay at this hotel but we wouldn t stay again if we came back to barcelona the walls between the rooms were so thin that you could hear everything we was very unlucky to have selfish and noisy people next door to us we could hear them snoring one of them coughing every minutes continuously throughout the evening and night using the hairdryer and talking amongst themselves at this disturbed our sleep so much but when we asked to move rooms the next day we couldn t as the hotel was fully booked so we had to move our beds to the opposite side of the room so the noise was more bearable
