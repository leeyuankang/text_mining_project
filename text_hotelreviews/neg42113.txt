refurbishment in progress noisy no stairs available if you would prefer to use the stairs or i just couldn t find it the quality of the breakfast was poor considering this category of hotel a service charge that is added to your bill which you can opt out of i don t mind giving a tip but a bill is presented with a service charge added as percentage of the total bill which amounts to more than i would like to give for a tip the d cor in the rooms was not just outdated but due for renewal overall i felt overcharged for the service provided
