the walls are thin if this puts you off you can here when others turn on the shower and breakfast is pricey at per person per day however the noise did not wake us or stop us from sleeping and breakfast can be obtained for a fraction of the price from the local supermarket the twin bed set up was also a bit problematic because they can come apart leaving a bit of a gap also the pillows are on the thin side but a spare pillow was available and my wife asked for another from reception
