the room was ok but not a room you expect in a star hotel really in need for a good cleaning dust and dirt in many places and also in need for some new furniture the staff was ok but nothing special apart from the waitor in the pool bar who was very nice the walls in the room were paper thin and we could hear a person in the next room snore and cough as well as people talking together even though they weren t that loud
