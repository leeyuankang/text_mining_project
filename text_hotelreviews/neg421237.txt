the rooms weren t particularly sound proofed so you could audibly hear guests slamming their doors and talking loudly in the halls in our first room we could hear a lot of noise from an adjacent building which wasn t great that said the staff very readily moved us to a quieter room and were very accommodating the second night they didn t change the towels or refresh the soap after cleaning the room
