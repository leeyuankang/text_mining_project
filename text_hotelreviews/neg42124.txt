over all not pleased with stay at all no robes in room as advertised with booking very run down hotel although works were being done they woke us very early in the morning with the renovating room service menu advertised a cajun chicken burger with salsa guacamole and fries what arrived was a defrosted burger bun with chicken and a bit of lettuce with cold plain fries on the side pounds for two burgers and two beers very disappointed when we arrived we were very tired so thought room service would have made up for the terrible noise and lack of run down hotel but was equally as terrible and i won t be back
