note stayed here in oct nov for days staff weren t personable or friendly to say the least had to wait to check in for ages and no one was on the front desk bear in mind this was midday and when had arrived no apology was given price of food beverages here is totally over priced for a bottle of water there s a supermarket literally secs from the hotel so be mindful of this actually booked a double bed room instead got two single beds placed side by side inconvenient only two really small enough to fit two people with no luggage elevators
