the hotel is far from anywhere and even to get the public transportation you have to walk minutes it is for groups travelling in organized trips and not for lone travelers as you will spend lots of money on taxi or will have to rent a car the balconies are connected and door locks to the balcony broken harming your self security feeling after oclock you will either have tpo travel to the city paying back and forth euros for a taxi or you will stay hungry as there is no more food is served you can always order online a meal like i did but i do not recommend as i had to wait for an hour and the food quality was bad
