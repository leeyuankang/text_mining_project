location is not easy to drive to with major roadbuilding right outside its at the end of metro line to central amsterdam staff messed up the payment through booking com and tried to tell me my card was refused in advance of the stay which is a plain lie i have never had this type of problem in many many booking com bookings before very disappointing especially as i took the time to respond to an advance request to update card details on the booking which were the same as all bookings i have made in the last couple of years with no problem obviously the card worked when offered at check in no hint of any apology but at least they allowed me to stay
