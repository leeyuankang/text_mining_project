i didn t realise the hotel was over mins away from the centre so it wasn t ideal for the purpose of our trip which was sightseeing the cleanliness wasn t great eg there was a vomit stain outside the entrance for the duration of our stay there were glasses in the corridor for nights outside our room not ours train station is min walk which is fine but not ideal if you get back quite late as it s in a bit of a remote area
