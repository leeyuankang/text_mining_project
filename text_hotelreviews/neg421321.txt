expensive for the accommodation provided the room was not so clean and there was no storage for clothes the room consists of beds pushed together which separate during the night a small desk with no drawers open hanging space and a block of wood from a tree to sit on i would advise other travelers to find other accommodation closer to the city this hotel is kms from central station the closest metro station is kilometer
