the location was extremely poor outside the city sits alone surrounded by motorway minute walk to the nearest metro no shops close by and no supplies in hotel you would think the tea coffee was coming out of the receptionist s salary given how tight she was with it i feel the hotel description was very misleading re distance views we had room the river view was was a stagnant pond the bed was uncomfortable with a huge dent in middle we couldn t open windows and air con screeched there were smears on the wall the bathroom was nice but no bath which we needed after long days of walking restaurant was poor and very overpriced we spent a fortune travelling to and fro hotel amsterdam itself is extremely expensive and we will not return
