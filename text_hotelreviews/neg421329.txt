the fact that we had arranged an early check in which was confirmed by the hotel staff in writing but they did not actually arrange anything as such we had to check in after our day in amsterdam no apologies nothing only hiding behind the phrase it is an additional service when it is possible i don not mind if the latter is actually the case can even understand it but then you should explicitly state that fact when you are confirming an early check in in writing or make amendments this is just terrible service to be honest
