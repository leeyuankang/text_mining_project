the late night concierge is terrible called him to qsk for directions at midnight and as soon i said hello he left me on hold and never picked up again when i arrived for check in he gave us a room with a terrible attitude like if we were bothering him to give us the twin room that we requested when the booking was made he told us yes it is twin is just that the beds are out together but you can pull the apart i want to clarify this was no easy task starting from the weight of the beds how the room is designed and the fact that it was a double mattress meaning only one bed good keep it at the end the real problem was how he was disturbed by this and the terrible attitude he showed towards us and our issue
