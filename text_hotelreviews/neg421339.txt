the reception staff were extremely welcoming and helpful however the bar kitchen staff let the score down they had messed up our food order and rather than apologising and making it right they spent a great deal of time blaming each other for the error the female chef in particular was extremely rude they all gave the impression that they couldn t be bothered with us which is a big let down compared to how lovely the reception staff were
