the rooms weren t perfectly clean i had two rooms for my family and both rooms had broken kettles one kettle was burnt and the other one was full of fungus because someone had left water inside without washing it for a long time also the drain of the sink in my room was clogged with a hairball and we had to remove it ourselves and finally the safety box in our room was blocked and despite we reported it nobody came over to unblock it the gym is poorly equipped and it was full of insects i went there one night and i came back with mosquito bytes guys you really need to put a net on the windows of that room or something the hotel is somehow far from the city centre it has a metro station minute walking distance but taxis are expensive from to the city centre
