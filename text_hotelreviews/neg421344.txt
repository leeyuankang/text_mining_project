the hotel was situated in the middle of nowhere it took me and my boyfriend hours to find and there was nobody around to ask for help we had to cut through a park after getting the train and we didn t feel safe at all it was far from the tourist part of amsterdam we hoped to recive even walking to the hotel there was no path or pavement a dog walker gave us a lift to our hotel but it s not ideal to stay here if you want city center amsterdam with the journey taking more than an hour to commute
