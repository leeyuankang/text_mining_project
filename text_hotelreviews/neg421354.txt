this motel is outside amsterdam basically in a field but charges per day parking complete with annoying ticket system moved rooms due to toilet constantly spewing water second room wasn t much better the heating couldn t cope with the freezing weather so the room was cold and the aircon loud there are much better hotels around schiphol
