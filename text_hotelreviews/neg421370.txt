terrible value for money and a terrible location arrived minutes after the restaurant closed to check in the website did not state a closing time for the restaurant and i had based my decision on that but the kitchen closes at i was told at reception that i could still order pizza at the bar but by the time i got to the bar after the barman ran to the kitchen as i arrived i was told that next month we offer this until but not now sorry the best i got was an offer of a take away that would take minutes to arrive the hotel is too remote to go anywhere else for food as staff would not offer any help i m sure there was food in the kitchen i ended up buying chocolate from reception at an extortionate price the hotel is not at all easily accessible by public transport it is actually outside the city limit the last metro stop is closed so you have to get a shuttle bus to it there is then no footpath so you will have to walk over grass to get to the nearest path and walk down a lonely road for ten minutes to get to the hotel the hotel will not order a taxi for you i asked and was refused apparently taxis won t take such a short journey i asked for the manager the morning after all of this and she was completely unhelpful i basically got a shrug but no apology i was expected to know that i should walk through the car park of the planetarium to get to the footpath when there was no signage despite paying a lot of money breakfast was not included in the rate and the room was pretty average the front of the hotel advertises it as a star not sure if this is correct i would never stay here again and would not recommend it
