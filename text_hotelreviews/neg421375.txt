personally the food for room service wasn t to my standards nor the price for it unfortunately not all rooms have balconys which if you smoke is a bit of a nightmare as we had to travel floors every time we wanted a cigarette the other real downer was the distance from the hotel to city centre you have to walk about minutes to the nearest metro station which unfortunately was in the middle of being refurbished which we never got told by hotel before booking or at least after booking so we then either had to walk minutes for the next metro station which isn t an easy walk considering you most likely don t know your way around our option then led to taxi s everywhere which are not cheap most taxis will charge between and that s not each way of course so i would definitely check the metro situation out before booking
