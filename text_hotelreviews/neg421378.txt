the hotel is lovely please be aware that this is a whole metro line away from amsterdam central plus a good walk from the metro stop plus the metro stop you need the very last one is under construction so you have to get off the stop before catch a bus then take a good walk once you have left it is not feasible to return until you have done for the day it is too far out so unfortunately we only slept at the hotel and did not enjoy any facilities but lovely comfy clean room
