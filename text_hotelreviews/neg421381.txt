breakfast was way too expensive at pp unfortunately there were roadworks ongoing around the hotel which i understand is not their fault and these kept us awake more than we d like the location has some things to be desired as it s a minute walk to the metro and mins into town but if you can budget this time in it s a great cosy spot i found the holding fee that the restaurant puts on your card a little excessive we had a hold of put on my account which i was not happy about
