the room was not that clean you could see hairs from previous guests all over the place after the morning cleaning they were still there the tea pot was dirty the location is far from the center and from the metro station from the hotel to the metro station you have to walk minutes it is a nice walk though from the hotel will the central station it takes around minutes
