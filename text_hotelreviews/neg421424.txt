the hotel is quite far from the city center although it is near the last station of one metro line that takes around minutes to get to the center however metro works only until midnight and although there are night buses these leave you too far from the hotel minutes walking just to keep as a reference a taxi from dam square city center to the hotel can cost nearly euros this was at night so i do not know if they charge more at night but there was definitely no traffic the room was very cozy and seemed super clean however when i left the soap next to the hand wash the next time i picked it up it was full of hair it looked like someone shaved and left the bathroom full of hair because i also spotted some of it in the shower
