it was very far away from the metro station and no transport was offered having to pay a deposit for each night we stayed was not discussed before we had booked nor after in fact and was only told to us when we arrived to check in this made us feel like the hotel did not trust us and it felt like a scam our rooms were not cleaned the entire stay
