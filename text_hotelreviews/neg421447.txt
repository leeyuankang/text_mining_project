okay first of all if you would like to experience amsterdam s night life golden tulip is not what you re looking for the last metro leave the centaal station around midnight and if you are tired after a long day you will find it difficult to take a min walk to the hotel plus they charge a euro deposit per night wich i personaly think they should ve mention in their official page not cool being charged in advance and not being aware of what to expect i find it ridiculous to pay euro for breakfast per day when you can buy groceries and cost less than euro for days the personel was a bit distant and our towels never got replaced
