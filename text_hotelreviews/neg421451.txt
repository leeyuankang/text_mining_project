i booked a deluxe twin room with bath and balcony for me and a friend when we got there we were upgraded to a double room without bath due to overbooking by the hotel if we had wanted a double bed we would have booked that we then had to pay an extra per night to get a room with a double bed and a sofa bed without bath and without balcony then when the extra set of sheets arrived there were dried spots of blood stained onto the quilt cover then to top it off on the second night when we returned from the city our key card didn t work anymore would never stay here again
