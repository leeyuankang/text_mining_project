the hotel is about a ten minute walk from the metro along the edge of the park which isn t bad but not fun pulling suitcases there isn t any taxi service available also the route isn t well sign posted and we just had to ask directions from a local vendor and walk until we found it the hotel itself isn t really located near any other restaurants or pubs so you have to get the metro most places if you wanted to eat out the hotel menu isn t bad but it s not very extensive the food was nice but needed a lot more of a selection based on nothing else being around
