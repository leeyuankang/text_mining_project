i booked a room with a lake view and when i got my room it had no lake view because it was blocked by the roof and i told reception i booked and payed for lake view she said you can see a little bit sorry the roof is blocking and worst of all i was there early and me and my girlfriend were tired so we needed the room even though the room was ready and all they made us pay euros for early check in which was meaningless
