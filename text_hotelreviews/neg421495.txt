on booking the hotel i had requested a double kingsize bed when arriving me at the hotel j was told there would be an extra charge to upgrade which i thought this was unfair as i had requested it at the time of booking the hotel was about mins from the metro which was a downside there was only towels in our rooms also which is quite difficult to work with when you have long hair also we went to the restaurant one evening and there was what seemed to be a complimentary bottle of water on our table but when the time arrive to pay for the meal we were charged for it
