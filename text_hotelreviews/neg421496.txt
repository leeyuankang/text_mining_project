the location is quiet far from the last metro station and there are no taxis to travel to hotel especially in the dark its very scary either provide some sort of shuttle service between the hotel and the metro station even calling a taxi from hotel was hard because the distance is too less to the metro station and we have to travel to the next metro station honestly this makes the stay itself pretty poor irrespective of how the hotel is
