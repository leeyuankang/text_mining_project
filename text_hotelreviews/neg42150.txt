i booked for wifi access and i was disappointed when i couldn t sign on even after that was fixed the internet signal could not stay longer than minutes so i gave up on the internet i had paid for and used my mobile internet people kept interrupting our room for mistaken messages my sleep was disrupted times even to the point where a staff member opened the door with their key card while we were inside
