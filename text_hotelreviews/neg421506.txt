bed really uncomfortable and double seems to be two single beds pushed together with two single duvets i myself am a receptionist in a hotel i this isnt a double room or even a zip twin said to reception was offered another room didnt move as the next room was the same so just gave up and put up with it we knew about the distance from waterloopen central airport but got annoying next time will stay in waterloopen also could serve food later considering the last metro was then u have a min walk when you get in and all there is are overpriced pringles and chocolate the closest shop or anything is the minuite walk and a metri ride
