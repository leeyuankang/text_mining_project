terrible location low water pressure from the tap and shower heads weak heating nice view of a busy road overpriced breakfast and every service of the hotel is actually overpriced a bit unkind hotel staff dirty glasses dirty towels etcetera unfortunately a lot more should ask for a partial refund i think
