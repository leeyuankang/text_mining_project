we arrived and our toilet has feces in it there were pubic hairs on the shower walls and drains the shower screen was not cleaned either we reported it to reception immediately and the next day after house keeping were in there were more hairs all over the walls when we would shower and the room would steam you could see the absolute filth of the place we took loads of photos to send to them to show them what we were talking about the carpet in the room was darks and stained from dirt i was disgusted with the lack of clean linen every set of sheets we received on our week holiday had marks on then of some sort ink blotches oh god sadly recalling the holiday is a bit of a drag the breakfast was for dried up buffet food nothing was covered and there were flies flying around and you can be sure they had laid some eggs on something of other the food was very disappointing in the hotel to pay so much money for a cesar salad and it was so bland and normal i could have made a nicer one with a salad bowl and some meet we only ate the once in the hotel and ate out afterwards considering the hotel is a min fast walk from the metro and the bus station i would have expected the food quality to be at least decent the staff were friendly except when they tried to charge us extra for out late check out we are regular customers of the chain and loyalty members to receive no acknowledgement for this was just such bad customer service we will be staying the the amsterdam west from now on and will never return to the riverside golden tulip which is a shame as we will be travelling three times a year with a group of tourist and we were scoping out the area they let the team down big time filthy and i wouldn t be back onless they refurbished the place it looks so nice on the pictures but they have great ways of airbrushing all the dirt away no apologies were made for our issues
