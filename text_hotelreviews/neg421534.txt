personal at the reception was indifferent at best with only one exception no explanation that you were charged for parking no info about breakfast and no goodbye or thanks for now which i would consider being standard on a hotel already at arrival i was cut off while explaining something and since the reception is the first and last thing you meet this has quite an impact on the overall experience we had trash in our room that was never disposed during our two day stay unless i were to find an amazing offer i would not go there again
