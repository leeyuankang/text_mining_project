the service was terrible at breakfast the restaurant wasn t busy but we had to wait a long time to be seated eventually had to go and find someone to seat us then we waited a long time to be served and had to actually call someone over before we were acknowledged the assumption was made that we wanted a buffet even though there was a menu to order from we had to ask for the menu we had eggs benedict and oddly there was tarragon in the hollandaise sauce but no advance warning of this
