the noise an event was in in the hotel and the music was loud not what i would expect for such a hotel the manager on duty that night was rude and un helpful the bed was uncomfortable and broken the hotel itself is beautiful such a shame the night for us was ruined by loud music and an unhelpful night manager we received a full refund for out night stay
