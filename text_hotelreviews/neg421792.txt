the staff wasn t very helpful with the first room air condition problems the water came to floor and air condition could not be used the first night was nightmare when we came back from the city next day the receptionist said that problem is fixed but no same situation finally we were able to change the room but no apologies unfortunately this left the feeling that this wasn t the first time this happened with this same room
