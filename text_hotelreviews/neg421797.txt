the swimming pool is listed probably just for meeting some bare minimum star requirements since the pool is really tiny no swimming is possible door veneer was hanging the main window was broken could not be flipped in the staff said they will look into the issues but nothing seemed to happen afterwards the bathroom was poorly separated from the room by a really noisy glass door water splashes from the shower would spread everywhere including towards the bedroom also to structure of the rooms was quite different from one room to another
