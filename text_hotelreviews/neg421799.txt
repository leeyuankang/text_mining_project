we decided to spend the extra money on getting a room with a bathtub as we have been choosing budget accommodation for the majority of our trip however the water flow was terrible it took an hour to fill the tub water barely came out of the shower head when we decided to shower and the hot water wasn t very hot unless you were using it for the bath if you have noisy neighbours especially if they re out on the balcony you may have trouble or sleeping
