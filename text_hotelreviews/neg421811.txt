i didn t like the fact the bar closed at and at i had my glass taken away they should let guest be able to finish there drink without it being whisked away also asked for late check out night before and the receptionist who had no people skills said well you talk to my assistant if you want to extend your room some staff were good some were short of a few people skills food was a bit limited choice advise going out for meals in evenings
