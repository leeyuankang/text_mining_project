it was up a very steep hill and was kind of a pain to get to the area coming up to the hotel smelled like sewers but a lot of the city did and the hotel itself didn t smell the area around us ie the stress up to the hotel and on the way to park guell had rude and alarming graffiti on the walls about tourists sometimes there were official posters against tourists too didn t make us feel welcome in the slightest
