its good value for money but it is not a star hotell but it has everything you need the rooms are not soundinsulated so you do hear alot of noise between the rooms but that is to be expected from a hotell of this standard ask for a room that doesnt face the street and not on the first floor the garbage man comes late at night to empty it and it makes noise but except from that it is a quiet residential area so its not that much noise
