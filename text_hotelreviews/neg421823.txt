the hotel s location wasn t practical at all it is far from most of the attractions and has limited shops restaurants and attractions within its surrounding basically there is nothing to see there therefore me and my fiance relied on the metro to take us to interesting touristic places also we found a few ants in the bathroom on our first day there
