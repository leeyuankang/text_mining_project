room the room itself was clean comfortable and everything that would be expected however and this is a gigantic but the bathroom was so badly designed that the designer installers should be shot sacked or otherwise dealt with forthwith a year old could possibly have done a better job the marble shelf above the basin was so low above the basin that it was impossible to turn the tap on properly especially for hot water the marble basin top had a large crack in it obviously broken on installation was neither repaired nor filled in in fact it was a natural trap for yuk dirt etc the bathroom door was a glass modern design badly designed didn t fit properly that gave little privacy in either sound or sight i can only talk about this one room but this bathroom does not do catalonian hotels any favours and i would seriously think on whether to ever stay here again this is from someone who has stayed in catalonian hotels in a number of spanish cities
