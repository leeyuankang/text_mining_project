location isn t good it s minutes walk from the metro and the hotel is located on a heal so you need to go rising the room is small and it feels like there is no air we could have heard the neighbors tv bathroom is also small and there isn t enough light i felt i was showering in the dark over priced to my opinion i wouldn t stay there again
