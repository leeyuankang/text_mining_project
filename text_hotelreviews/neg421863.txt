no hot water and poor water pressure on the first morning of our stay warm water the next and hot the other three days no coffee or tea facilitates in the room only a coffee machine on ground floor euro a pod we were on fourth beds on wheels so always moved when getting in or out and pillows very soft and it takes about minutes to walk to the top of la rambla but is harder finding the hotel in the side streets in the dark
