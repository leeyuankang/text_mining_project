the price was quite expensive but ok we booked it last min but when i saw the offer it was saying with breakfast included and as i was receiving the mail i realized that there was saying paying your breakfast if i knew it i could take a photo screen to prove it also the price was and as i was starting to pay it was almost without the taxes to spain o good reputation for the hotel or the bookings
