i booked a double bed as a single traveller and they gave me a good size room with terrace but no double bed i asked for one as i booked and then they gave me a tiny box room on the other side of the hotel i eventually asked them for the same sized room as at the beginning and the only one available was with twin beds disappointing in general and inconvenient i think as a solo traveller they did not put much importance into my stay pool very small
