the bathroom was very dirty the door and the window were all stained seemed like they were never cleaned the small window would not open fully which is better because just outside the window was this spiky plant and a lot of dirt and there was no ventilation system the towels were also stained there wasn t a toilet brush and at a certain point we had ants all around the sink reaching for our cosmetic products the sink and tub drain were very slow and i honestly couldn t tell what the cleaning lady was cleaning in the bathroom our toiletries were only replaced once in days and not all of them just the shower gel also the pool was only open until definitely overpriced overall and deceiving for a stars hotel
