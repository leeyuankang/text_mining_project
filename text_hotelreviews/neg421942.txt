the hotel does not merit four stars there is some mold in the bathroom the tab leaked and flooded the floor significantly we did not have the phone line in the room we complained that we need the room phone but the management did nothing three days without a phone line impeded our local contacts we do not fancy mobile phones so the absence of a phone line in our room spoiled our stay in this hotel
