our room was located beside a maintenance room the noise from this maintenance room during the night was terrible it left us both tired during the day we got moved to a different room on complaining the first three nights were shocking the walls were paper thin and we could hear other guests talking in adjacent rooms and further away rooms quite easily we ate lunch in the hotel bar on arrival this was our one and only time the food was overpriced the chicken was destroyed in salt and the burger was undercooked in the middle not nice took a long time to get served too
