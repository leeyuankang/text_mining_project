the hotel is impossible to find without a gps since the street signs are not clearly indicated the parking which is also nearby doesn t have sign saying it s for the hotel which led to some confusion the room we had originally which we had booked as non smoking smelled of smoke because we were on the fourth floor and the third floor is a designated smoking area but the hotel handled it well and changed us at no charge it was also somewhat expensive for the original room we booked for two nights but that might have been due to the new year
