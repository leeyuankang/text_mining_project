was not such a good experience the hotel is situated on the top of a hill they were very understaffed the one receptionist answers phone calls to take orders for the kitchen and manages the check in at the same time the swimming pool is really tiny not even worth it my shower had no curtain so there was always a puddle on the bathroom floor
