on the day we arrived we were told they were fully booked although i booked the room a month ago and i suspect due to our late flight time we were given a triple room instead of the double we had booked although it slightly resembled the pictures on the website it was definitely not the same standard as the room we had booked standard double bathroom was not particularly clean and there were ants we stayed one night in this room but on the second day after catching a glance at the rooms on the other side of the hallway when they were being cleaned i realised that our room was definitely not an equal standard and asked to move staff were really great and moved us straight away the second room was great clean and ant free i was really happy with the second room but probably would have been left feeling rather disappointed if we would have stayed in the original for our full stay i should point out i marked down cleanliness for the first room we stayed in however the second was spotless
