we checked in early so thought great requested a king size room and booked a king size room with booking com however were given a twin room which was tired and shabby ceiling paper coming away from ceiling scuff marks on walls and told non were available contacted booking com and this was mysteriously resolved but took an hour to resolve also no free wifi as was offered on the site rooms were definitely not four star three star is acceptable only booked this hotel as we stayed many times at marriott panaji in goa india but this hotel is a tad overpriced also booking com at time of booking requested cash payment on arrival which on arrival i was told it must be paid on credit card of which i only had cash maybe it was booking com giving false information it wasn t hotel from hell far from it but no way
