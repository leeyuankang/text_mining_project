unfortunately there was construction in the building right next to us the banging started before every morning we would have liked to have been told about it at check in and given the option to change rooms when we informed the management they knew nothing about the construction which we found strange the manager said she would get back to us regarding options and never did we mentioned it again the following day and were told the manager was not there but she would call us we left a cell number both times never heard back disappointing and mentioned it again at checkout so at the very least they could inform the next guests who were going to stay there about the noise issue before they moved in and unpacked
