when we just arrived we were shocked of the room size it was not as big as described in booking com when i contacted the reception they have informed me that they gave us one of the biggest rooms in the hotel additionally there was some road work which was creating noise all the time surprisingly no kettle for a star hotel it was the first time to see a duvet without cover they just put a sheet to cover it so while you move the duvet will move and this was not comfortable at all the card key will stop working every two days i think the hotel is over priced
