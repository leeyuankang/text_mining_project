it s just a note we booked for a dinner at their restaurant for the new year s eve and was somehow disappointed in a sense that there was no touch of festive atmosphere the table was not set for the occasion it was just like having your normal breakfast as it was also in the restaurant where they serve breakfast the staff tried their best and the food was not bad so in the end it was nice just the bar guy he was very much understressed and did not even acknowledge that he could not prepare our cocktails and was passing our table as if he did not see us it was not very polite of him
