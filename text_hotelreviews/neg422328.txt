we had made our reservation months ahead of time upon arrival we were told that no room with a large bed was available as we had requested finally single beds were made up into one large bed the room was very small decor has priority over functionality space was accorded to a very large chair that we did not use the chair was hiding the full lenght mirror that we could not use the small closet was located inside the bathroom the toilet was inches away from the bathtub such a room pleasant to look at was not planned for two people who travel with luggage i do not call this comfort considering the price we paid it was a big disappointment
