the rooms and the bed are smaller than it seems on the picture gallery they don t have the king size bed but on booking com they have king size bed option the biggest they have is queen size bed which is small even for a couple or two single bed together the last option isn t comfortable because it has a gap between the two beds the staff is nice but the one who did our check in laura gave us a very small room and didn t want to give us a larger room and wasn t very friendly
