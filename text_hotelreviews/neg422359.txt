we left the room in the morning made some sightseeing tour and around pm we have returned to the room to change our cloth the door was closed and when we opened it there was a cleaning lady quickly going out from our sleeping room and went to the bathroom when we entered the sleeping room we have seen it is already cleaned so we didn t understand why she went out from there once we have entered but then we found out there is our suitcase laying on the ground even so it was in the corridor s cabinet before we left the room in the morning after that we have discovered it is unlocked by an airport security key even so it was locked before we left when we asked the cleaning lady why has she manipulated with our suitcase she didn t answer as she didn t speak english then we checked our second suitcase and we found out it was manipulated with it as well but the fact that in such hotel category someone tried to rob us was simply shocking when we said this to the customer service the only result was they have apologized for it but that s all they did no compensation for such behavior nothing just saying we apologize and at the end when we have checked out the nicest surprise waited for us we have received the invoice having our address totally wrong it was written there that we are from bucarest rumania croatia and republica checa actually only the name was correct with kind regards
