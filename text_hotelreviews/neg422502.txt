there were several things that we were unhappy with throughout the course of our stay the staff gave us single beds to sleep in we requested one double bed when we asked to move they allowed it to happen one day later but without even an apology for the inconvenience the housekeeping staff walked into the room when we were in it a total of times throughout our short stay they did not knock but simply used their access key to come into the room at various points throughout the day staff weren t outright rude but made no attempt to ensure a pleasant stay very apathetic
