the pools were more plunge pools than actual pools but were still nice our a c wouldn t cool the room down to the temperature we wanted i had called the front desk and was told the temp would kick in within mins of us setting the temperature but it never did we were there for days and the room never cooled down below degrees even though the thermostat was set for degrees i also think the temperature was locked to be eco friendly because we couldn t get the temperature to set to anything below degrees either not a big deal since we were only there to shower and sleep but it is the reason i gave it a good rating vs an excellent rating for room facilities i prefer my room on the cool side to sleep hotel breakfast was good but a bit pricey at euros per person we only ate there on our last day
