no glasses cleared from the room for our entire stay the pool photo is exceptionally well taken the pool is actually pretty small and situated by the bar with people drinking smoking eating we didn t use it once in the end drinks on arrival we didn t receive anything until we raised this even though we saw multiple guests arrive and receive a much warmer welcome than we had
