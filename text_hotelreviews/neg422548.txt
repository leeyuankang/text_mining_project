we ve got to stop in our room during the day and when we ve arrived to hotel our room was left open nobody inside cleaning lady went somewhere and have not returned for at least five minutes more like so all of our belongings were left there unprotected anybody could have entered and take anything from our stuff moreover when got back to our room in the night on the same day we ve found out that cleaning was not finished no clean towels provided even though we ve stopped at the reception to report the security incident in the afternoon they ve not bothered to make sure everything was alright and i had to call a reception again to get fresh towels otherwise our stay would be just fine but this security cleaning topic made it the worst stay i have had in barcelona stayed in pulitzer regina etc especially considering the fact that we ve informed the reception staff
