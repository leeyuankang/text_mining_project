the first room i got that i actually booked was tiny with a small window to inside of hotel i changed for extra eur per night for a room with a terrace to the inner yard when you sit on the terrace you get all sorts of smells of cooking and garbage the wardrobe is tiny i could hardly fit shirts in it also i checked out at am and as the hotel was full the staff could have offered me a small discount for checking out earlier overpriced
