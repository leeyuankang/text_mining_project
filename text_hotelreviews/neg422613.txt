the room cleaners started on the top floor at i think this is too early the days we forgot our do not disturb sign they actually woke us up by knocking wanting to come in to clean this early the poolside cocktails were tiny mostly ice so sips later and it was gone they also charged the same for a virgin cocktail as an alcoholic one small complaints though mostly this hotel was fantastic
