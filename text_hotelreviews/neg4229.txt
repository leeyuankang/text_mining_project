unacceptable level of customer service once we arrived we paid for an upgrade for a more spacious room with a view the room was indeed lovely yet the temperature in the room was extremely low it was freezing cold they send us an engineer to fix the air conditioning system we spent approximately hours calling at the reception and waiting for the engineer to finish his work waiting for the air conditioning system to be fixed at some point we had to leave the room because we had scheduled business appointments the hotel personnel reassured us that by the time we would be back everything would be fine at when we returned to the room we faced the same condition a freezing cold room we spent one hour fighting with the duty manager and the hotel personel till they brought us portable heaters in the room and we eventually managed to heat the room with those heaters the air conditioning system never worked as the hotel personnel kept insisting
