the service at the reception a mins check in is definitely not acceptable it should only take mins which was not my case and not the case of other clients as i could experience and see the decoration of the rooms with little changes it could look much better it was dark colored old fashioned without taste and depressive it was really not to my taste not nice at all the pillows were super uncomfortable and i have now a problem with my neck that i have to fix with an osteopath back home the extra euros charge so that i could have a bedroom not standard with a window viewing outside rather than on a wall imagine how horrific this is i remained under the shock when i happened to know that i saw later on internet that the hotel management explains that there are people that like to have a bedroom facing a wall so that it is quiet you have to be joking all these negatives made me think that this hotel is very lucky to keep its star and i wonder why maybe for its location i will not go back there and will not recommend it to anybody
