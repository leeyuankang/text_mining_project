very disappointed that there were no tea coffee making facilities in the room i asked if we could have a small kettle and was told there was no problem getting boiling water from the bar but they made it difficult e g had to wait minutes for someone to be there to give you a small jug of boiling water i believe they were charging for a small jug of milk but i m not completely sure about that i wouldn t pay that for a drop of milk so just had black tea
