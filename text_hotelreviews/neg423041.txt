we requested a late check out and were granted an extra hour any longer would cost around euro per hour we also had to wait for minutes after asking for our boarding passes to be printed or else we would have to pay around euro to use the computer these are minor issues however i already paid an extra euro to upgrade our room on arrival so getting a boarding pass printed and late check out isn t much to ask as the availability was obviously there
