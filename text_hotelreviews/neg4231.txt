i booked one double room for myself and my husband and a twin room for my daughters the girls room was lovely and spacious giving them great comfort whereas ours was rather cramped with a small bathroom and not much space to get in and out of the door once our suitcase was on the case stand i also felt the wardrobes were not deep enough to fit suites in without the doors staying open this was even more restricted by the ironing board being located in the wardrobe too
