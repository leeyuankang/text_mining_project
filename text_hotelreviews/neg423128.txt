lifts are too small and need to wait for a long time the hotel leaves a note in every room to ask customers help them save water and energy to reuse the towels if we d like to help we need to hang up the towels they didn t say where we did it with only one hook in the bathroom then the next day the cleaner took away all the hand towels including the clean ones and the wet ones for an unknown reason and just left two bath towels for the whole family don t really understand the reason why its inconvenient to call them and constantly ask for more towels
