the website mentioned that there was a rooftop pool and a jacuzzi the water was too cold for these to be used they should be listed as seasonal and it should be made clear that the jacuzzi is not in the wellness centre but on the rooftop the wellness centre has a great little gym and a nice sauna however when i went to use the sauna it wasn t on so i wasn t able to make use of the sauna jacuzzi or pool all of which were featured why i booked this hotel the area that the hotel is in is good in terms of being a short walk from the main tourist strip and the gothic area harbour and beach however it s a very edgy area and there were lots of prostitutes and other characters around that made it feel risky to walk back late at night i was travelling with my daughter and we ended up coming in early every night as the local area didn t feel safe the room initially didn t have a coffee machine even though this was listed on the site i asked for one which they brought but it didn t work it was frustrating my daughter is coeliac and i am lactose intolerant so having breakfast in the room was necessary as not many cafes can cater for us lastly on our third day we left the sign on the door asking for our room to be cleaned and went out for hours when we returned it hadn t been cleaned the maids apologised we went out again for another hour or more and still it wasn t cleaned i would expect better service considering i feel this hotel rides on its aesthetics and unfortunately the service and facilities don t live up to it i ve stayed in cheaper places recently where they have been more attentive we have had much more space been in a better area and have had netflix and youtube available on the tv as well as all the foreign channels there was nothing at all to watch on the tv and no way of connecting the phone to it as the tv was old
