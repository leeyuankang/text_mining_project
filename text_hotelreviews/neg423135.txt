one of the worst places we have ever stayed for sure i have travelled all around the world but this place for sure deserves to be entitled campsite they are under staffed and over loaded you ask for some ice and get charged euros even for delivering food to your room they charged you they don t change the bedsheets and pillow case assuming that you would not find out they just turn them around and use the same dirty sheets the location of the hotel is awfull where you seriously fear for your life if you want to go out after pm even taxi drivers refuse to drop you off there honestly there is no management at all btw your breakfast was awful and the same sh every day i will never ever stay at your awful place again and not even recommend your campsite to my enemies for the people from some countries your campsite may look alright but let s face it you are not even close to being fine
