didn t like the lay out of the room bathroom arrangement was poor with little privacy no bath toilet was in a cupboard with a heavy sliding door the sink was divided from the bedroom with a suspended mirror and on the same shelf as the coffee machine so toiletries mixed up with drinks facilities no kettle the coffee machine didn t get the water hot enough for tea no wardrobe
