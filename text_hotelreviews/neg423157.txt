the set up of the room was not very convenient especially the bathroom facilities were lacking privacy i would prefer a bathroom as a separate room with a door that closes also the fact that you could either have the closet open or the toilet room was a bit annoying the quality of breakfast could be improved eg better quality of bacon fresh scrambled eggs instead of powder type
