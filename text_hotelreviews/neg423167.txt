the hotels location was really good only a short distance from ramblas and all the main attractions however the side road which you have to walk down to get to ramblas is extremely scary you feel unsafe the whole time we stayed there for days and in the day time the street was fine but as soon as it was night time it was awful we seen fights down that street and every night the street is full of prostitues who constantly follow any men down the street even when i was walking with my partner they would follow us and grab his pockets to try and get into them if you are english and alone i would definitely avoid this street during dark
