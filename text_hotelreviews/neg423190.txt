the elevators are a joke and have a mind of their own the doors are incredibly loud and when your neighbor opens or closes it sounds like someone is trying to get in the showers make a knocking noise all night long the area is really bad drunks druggies prostitues and dodgy looking guys everywhere disclosure we are parisian and are adjusted to these types i imagine it might be a lot harder to accept for americans or germans finally the cleaning staff left our door ajar one afternoon god knows for how long luckily we locked everything of value in the safe overall pretty nice but a terrible location and a bit dated now
