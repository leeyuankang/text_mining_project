they weren t very good at making up the room every day we stayed for days and there were areas that were a little unclean i m a bit of a neat freak so even with the little areas that weren t entirely clean it didn t bother me to the point of not recommending it to anyone it was quite minor the beds were clean and extra comfy the ac was nice too
