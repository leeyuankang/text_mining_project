the hotel was ok but very dark no privacy for the shower the room layout is very poor the third bed was a childs chair bed not ideal for an adult with no mattress there was a flashing smoke detector that made it very difficult to sleep there was also plenty of noise ingress into the room at night and we were on the sixth floor
