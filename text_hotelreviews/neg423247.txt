the first and second day during my stay my shower flooded and water ran into my room all over the place after calling in the team to get it fixed the problem was rectified however in almost any other hotel a room upgrade would have been offered that wasn t the case location of the hotel is good however more located on the rougher side of the ramblas not very safe at night in some nearby streets prostitution and drug dealing is clearly visible my friend got mugged right outside the door of the hotel entrance phone stolen
