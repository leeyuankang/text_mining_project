the swimming pool is very tiny but there is a small jacuzzi at the end of it the deepest area in the swimming pool is and the tiny pool closes at it was still nice to use it to refresh yourself the view is so amazing that it was still ok to have a small pool we didn t mind but there is no privacy for the shower as it is in the room it might be an issue if you want some privacy while showering
