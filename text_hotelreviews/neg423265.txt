the bathroom was poorly designed my friend had to stay on the bed whilst i showered so she didn t see me because you could see the entire room from the shower due to the mirror the surrounding area wasn t very nice either as a young girl in a foreign country i didn t feel safe walking down the roads around the hotel so got taxis from right outside most of the time
