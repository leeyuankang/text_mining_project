for a star superior hotel i would expect a little bit more comfort in the hotel rooms though they are very new and modern they are very small privacy is not really given as the toilet door is acually a thin mirror wall which you can push to the side and back furthermore probably it will be no problem for a couple but as i ve been traveling with a group of friends it was first a little bit unpleasant as the shower or the bathroom at all is not seperated from the rest of the room
