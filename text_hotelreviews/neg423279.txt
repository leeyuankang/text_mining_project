unfortunately of our party fell ill just before travelling to the hotel and was unable to make the trip on arrival we asked to cancel her breakfast for the duration of our stay as it would not be needed and we did not want to pay extra for something someone was not going to eat we were told they needed to speak with the manager but the manager was not present we stayed at the hotel for nights and asked every day to cancel the breakfast everyday we got the same response and again the manager was never present on the final day when we were leaving we asked about the cancellation of the breakfast and a refund they told us we should have contacted bookings com why they could not have told us this at the start of the holiday i do not know they told us they could not give us a refund and that we should have gone through bookings com if they had told us this when we first asked at the start of the holiday we would have as such i think it would only be fair and property that bookings com provided us a refund for this breakfast for the days and they can seek compensation from the hotel
