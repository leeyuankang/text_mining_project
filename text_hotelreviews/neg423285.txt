the restaurant manager was extremely rude and unhelpful its a real shame as all the other staff were so attentive and helpful its a shame that he let the entire work force down it was because of him we and our experience we decided to refrain from eating any food at the hotel which would have meant we would have spent more money in the hotel rather than go outside
