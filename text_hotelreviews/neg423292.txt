when we arrived we were charged more than when we booked the hotel with booking com this was above the city charge which we accepted we would pay on arrival memory foam topper on beds was hot at night and meant less sleep for us third bed soda bed in triple room means it s difficult to get in and out for one person in main bed small roof terrace pool not open until summer which was not clear when booked although overall very modern clean hotel in a fantastic location
