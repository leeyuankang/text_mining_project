the location is near the centre las ramblas however not a good part of barcelona a lot of locals and groups of homeless people right outside the hotel in the square did not feel safe the staff were unhelpful with directions booking restaurants very reluctant to give you their time there is no coffee maker in the room despite it saying so online air con didn t work if your sharing the room with a relative or friend its no use as everything is open plan and you can see the other person taking a shower very small rooms people in our room and still would only give us towels glasses for no rooftop bar despite again saying online you have to buy drinks from the ground floor and take them up the pool is no larger than a front porch
