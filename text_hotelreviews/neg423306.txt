as a lone female traveller i found that the raval area at night had some unsavoury characters which made me look over my shoulders a little but in the daytime i was ok and just tried to be as streetwise as possible the hospital gardens and boqueria market were conveniently within minutes walk and the port was about minutes walk which was useful as i made use of one of the boat tours which ran from as i was there out of season
