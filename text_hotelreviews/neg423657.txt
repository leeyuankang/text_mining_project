everything was so perfect that the below bothered me my son drinks special milk which i was carrying it needed to be warmed didn t expect to be charged every time i asked for it to be heated for a minute max once a day stayed for nights in a family suite paid good money for the suite didn t expect them to charge me anything albeit euros for warming a mere milk it s not about the euros but when one is paying thousands then such a genuine request should not have been charged otherwise everything else exceeded my expectation
