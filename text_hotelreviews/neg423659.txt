front desk service was far below the service levels and hospitality i have enjoyed in comparable hotels this includes poor communication misinformation and a nasty surprise about check out just an hour before i was due to leave although it was resolved i still left mins ahead of plan and didn t appreciate the way it was managed i was also in a room which smelt of paint which couldn t be rid off it seemed like the room was recently refurbished but clearly not ready for occupancy but through out my stay i repeatedly heard the front desk mentioning the property was overbooked so this probably explains it
