the worst thing was the delay in check in they made us wait hours after the regular check in time in order to have rooms tidy and ready even after that the bathroom was dirty so we had to call the housekeeping team to help we thought the cleaning team is not enough per floor we used to return to the hotel late in the afternoon and the rooms were still not cleaned this is also the reason for late check in
