check in took forever they gave us the wrong room at first not the one we booked online finally got the room we booked and was disappointed when we walked in they confirmed that they had moved our wake up call to our new room we never received a wake up call and we had to leave for the airport first thing in the am luckily my husband woke up early upon checkout we found out they made a wake up call to our old room and made the occupant of that room very angry for waking them up so early the pool closed way too early so we weren t able to enjoy it part of the reason we booked the hotel was for the rooftop pool
