the hotel could ve been cleaner the location wasn t the best as it feels like it s a bit out of the way there are a few cafes and bars around but it still a good walk from the marina and the beach the surrounding area is quite shabby and there are a lot of rundown buildings lots of graffiti and squats i think the price was expensive for what it was there was no iron in the room and the breakfast was incredibly overpriced the weekend was also really noisy one morning we couldn t sleep until am i wouldn t stay here again
