the reception is on the forth floor of a shopping center so finding the car park well below ground and then getting your luggage up to the hotel takes some work the cost of parking is high but you do get a discount through the hotel but when you add this to you overall cost works out a little on the high side breakfast ok but powered eggs and machine coffee are my particular pet hates but overall not so bad plesent staff though
