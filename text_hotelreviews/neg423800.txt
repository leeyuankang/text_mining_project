cleanness was a joke staff were very unfriendly and rude i thought receptionist at least should be able to speak a little bit of english with their guests bed and mattress were too old and we got backpain after one night sleeping on the bed very slow wifi swimming pool not usable our room was very dark with small windows to give you view of nothing stay away from this motel even if you receive a free vachure to stay there do not recommend that oh one more thing if you book a pay now room they would not take the money right way they wait and charge you upon arrival with current currency affected by the fluctuation so you will pay so much more than you see on their website
