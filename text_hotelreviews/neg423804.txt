the day we checked out the taxis in barcelona were on a strike and we needed to catch our train to madrid we re not locals to know that the taxis will be on a strike the least the hotel staff could do is to arrange a private transport for us since we had alot of luggages and bags we asked the hotel staff for help and they sarcastically told us to take the metro local train to the station one of our worst experiences ever will nvr recommend this hotel
