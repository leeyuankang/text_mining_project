the only reason we haven t left after the first night was parking it s totally not a stars hotel our room was not in good condition scratched floor a trace of shoe on the armchair stale air air conditioner worked strange when i tried to switch it off it started making loud sounds after few tries it finally switched off ventilation seemed to be broken windows were steamed up in the morning no toilet brush bedclothes was changed only at first day in other hotels of this group it was changed every day as well as towels parking costs euro per night looks more like stars hotel too expensive for poor quality and not comfortable
