i stayed in this hotel for nights but my experience was not up to my expectation all the receptionists do not pay attention when you speak to them and they deal with you like you are buying from grocery they spoke to me and spoke to other guest at the same time it was bad impression from the beginning i requested cup from restaurant at pm and they told me to come to take them because they do not have room service the staff in the restaurant are or only and trying to manage to serve all the guests but was not manageable the cleanness in the hotel is a big issue and does not worth to stay and pay euros night i will never ever book in this hotel again if i plan to visit barcelona this hotel deserve from mark only
