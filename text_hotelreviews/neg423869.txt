i can t prove it but i am sure that on the booking com website it said that breakfast was included in a different colour writing though we were told it wasn t upon arrival nothing major but it just set us in a less relaxed mood waiting for something else unpleasant unexpectedly to come up it was rainy and cold day we got wet but the heating didn t work in the room there was a sound of something happening but after hours we switched it off because nothing was happening the sink and the bath were not draining well at all overall i would say we had a good stay but there is a room for improvement
