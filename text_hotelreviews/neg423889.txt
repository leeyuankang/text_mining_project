i was very put out at the rudeness of one sole member of staff who was serving another customer on my arrival after waiting for minutes i asked how long it would take to which she abruptly replied i m serving this customer i again asked the same question with the words i ve had a long journey and wish to know if i can visit the bathroom if the wait would be longer same rude reply again from her i don t understand why the man gent consider her right for that role in day we requested an iron to the room after hours waiting and heading out i asked why the delay to be told it wasn t available but no one informed us but we managed to get one next day the hairdryer in the bathroom was making a loud noise and smoke was coming out i reported this dangerous situation which took a further days to be replaced after further insistence from me oh and when asking for an ironing board at reception it was handed over to me to carry up to my room by myself a guest this isn t a star hotel nor service nor staff breakfast was always cold and bland not at all happy with this place and won t be coming back
