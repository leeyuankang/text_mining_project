we did not like the area very smelly and dog mess on the pavements very off putting the room did not have any tea coffee making facilities the furniture needed attention the tiles in the bathroom needed regrouting and a good clean house keeping not on the ball we had to ask for fresh towels at in the afternoon on the second day wi fi kept dropping out the staff appeared to be moody and not overly helpful especially when i reported a leak in the bathroom the staff on duty said it was the air conditioning and said he would arrange for some one to have a look at it or arrange another room for us neither of these happened i would not recommend this hotel to a friend and would not stay here again value for money zero and staff need to improve on their customer care
