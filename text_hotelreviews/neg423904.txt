a lot the reception staff greater us with check in not until o clock when we arrived we just wanted to drop the bags and go out the key cards to the two rooms we had keep not working we were told it was because of our mobile phones but we did not have them with us it was frustrating to have to repeatedly go down from the floor to get them reset the check in procedure was far too long so there was always long waits at reception you should only have to show your passport credit card and sign they seemed to have to manually type in everything while you stood there the sink was blocked and despite three requests it was half fixed three days later but blocked again lock on bathroom door did not work some sun chairs on deck broken and need to be replaced
