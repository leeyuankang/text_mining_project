the pool is described as amazing on the information guide its not amazing its small and surrounded by a poor atmosphere the toilet seat was broken and moved every time i sat on it the toilet doesnt have a lock but it does have a fake lock for absolutely no reason whatsoever the safe didnt work i guess the battery was dead on the lock the staff are not great i called reception to ask if the tap water was drinkable the lady there said i dont know i said can you ask someone else there that does know she said please call back and put the phone down would have been nice to have tea coffee facilities the bed had wheels which means if you try to lean up to watch tv you end up rolling the bed forward and falling back behind the bed it seems to be in a run down area loads of graffiti on walls on the way to the beach not much going on quite a boring location the view from our room was a building nothing to look at
