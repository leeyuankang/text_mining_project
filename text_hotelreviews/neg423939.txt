the hotel is not situated from the metros it is about to be precise the hotel is not a four star in my eyes there is a bar fridge with no drinks inside the bed is slanted and there is not the luxury and service expected from a four star hotel the hotel doesnt have a seperate shower the service from the staff is also not at a star level
