me and my friend checked in this hotel quite late at night around due to delay of the flight the receptionist told us there was no double room available they can only offer the only room left for that night which was for disabled people and has no bath we booked and paid full amount in advance he didn t even apologise or say sorry at all just keep telling us it was the only one he could offer for that night it was quite late at night so there was no managers to speak to either we had to stay in that room for one night room was quite small the toilet was smelly floor was flooded after having a shower absolutely horrible the second and third night we changed to the floor which has a normal and better condition still didn t get the two single bed room as requested the whole point to book a hotel in advance is to make sure we get the room we want and have a enjoyable holiday obviously this time we didn t get anything we want from this hotel loscationwise not quite close to the metro station takes about mins to walk to get to the city centre it s better to take the bus then metro please train your receptionists to be nice and polite to have manners to everyone even the lady who s doing room cleaning service has a better and friendly attitude towards us even tho she can t speak very good english overall not happy about the service won t go back again won t recommend to friends either
