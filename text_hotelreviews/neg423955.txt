the hotel is a bit soulless and lacking in charm the room s are good size but have no coffee or tea making facilities we thought that a bit mean i need a cup of tea or coffee when i wake up the card used for getting into the room does not have the address of the hotel on it we gave it to a taxi driver to say where we wanted to go and he said which one there are five hotels of that name my phone was flat fortunately he lent me his to look up my booking having the address of the hotel on the card would have been so much easier
