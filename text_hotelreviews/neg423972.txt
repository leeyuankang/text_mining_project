the room was a little dirty on our arrival and hairs that were hanging on the wall didn t get cleaned away during our stay the room gets stuffy traveling in march that means it s still fine and you can open the windows i don t know if in the summer the aircondition is on more power wifi very slow but we had free through our provider which made looking up info easier
