the night we arrived we had to wait for mn at the lobby before being able to check in because there was a computer problem at the reception however the staff was nice enough to provide us with some drinks and snacks while waiting the bathtub seemed pretty cheap as it is only composed of very light plastic the weight of your body on it is enough to deform it plus the walls around it were quite dirty in general more or less everything in the room looks cheap especially the walls when you take a closer look at it as for the bed the mattress was very hard and the blanket provided was really thin and uncomfortable to use during the night even if it did keep us warm enough last but not least the walls are very thin so be expected to be disturbed by noisy neighbours this hotel shouldn t clearly be rated as a star hotel
