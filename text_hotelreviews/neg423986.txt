the new management has decided to use a strong perfume which seems to come through the ventilation system and pervade the entrance and reception area i found it extremely unpleasant you could even smell it out in the street on approach after two days i felt quite sick by it i am quite sensitive to artificial odours like these some affect my breathing and give me headaches i did ask when i was leaving if the reception manager could pass on my complaint about this i have stayed at this hotel times now three under the old confortel management where this had not been an issue it is not a fancy hotel but safe convenient and comfortable for my needs after this visit however i am not sure i would or could return if the management continued with this practice as the smell became increasingly problematic for me many people suffer from the effects of artificial perfumes and it seems strange to have such a dominant and in my view sickly smell in this public place what s wrong with the smell of a clean well kept entrance and reception which is far more welcoming please illunion barcelona get rid of the perfume your hotel is fine without it the other thing i noticed this time which seemed a bit of a negative was the small number of reception staff on duty who appeared to be working very long shifts this seemed to affect one person s performance on the desk considerably this may be because it was in december and low season it was unbelievably slow so i hate to think what it might be in the summer months if the policy of the new management is to cut costs by employing less staff
