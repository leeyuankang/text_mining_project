we stayed three nights in barcelona the sink was blocked on the first night but they didn t have a technician to fix it and the hotel was fully booked so they couldn t move us to another room we asked for an extra blanket on the first day but they said the room service was closed so they didn t have any extra blanket however the sink was fixed the next day and we were given an extra blanket the bathroom door was broken and wouldn t close
