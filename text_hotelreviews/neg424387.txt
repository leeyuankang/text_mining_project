i booked a single room upon arrival i was offered an upgrade for a fee i declined the offer turned out i got the upgrade anyway they obviously did not have the simple room i booked and tried to get some money extra i found that quite cheap behaviour in the room was a note that if i wanted a coffe tea maker i would only need to inform the front desk and they would bring it so the next day i asked for one turned out they charged euro a day for it because i had not booked that specific level of room so first i was given an upgrade i didn t ask for then i had to oay additional for a service that came for free to the room bad policy last but not least there s only slow elevator in the hotel at rush hour in the morning people wait for ever have a room on the or floor if you want to avoid that nuisance
