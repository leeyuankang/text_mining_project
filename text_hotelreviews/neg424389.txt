singles pushed together for the bed card details taken at property without letting me know just can i see a card please sir and then deducted euro from the card and told me after bit unprofessional the biggest gripe was the single beds the executive room wasn t really very executive it was small and a little cramped in the corner of floor room my partner works in travel and she wasn t very impressed the free soft drinks in mini bar option for having the delux room wasn t worth the extra euro a night it s bottle of cola bottle of orange juice and bottle of water per day the price you pay is probably not worthit there were hotels of a similar standard for a lot less when booking the exec room i expected a little more overall i wouldn t re book the property but it was ok
