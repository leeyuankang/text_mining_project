booked a superior room for two and had the confirmation for that at arrival they told us the room was not available and offered two single rooms instead we declined so we got what they call standard double the room was minuscule had no heating at all the window that went on an inner courtyard was completely condensed after half an hour we tried to warm up the room with the hairdryer in addition to that the curtain didn t go up at all the overall experience was absolute sub standard in compensation they offered after some discussion a complementary breakfast and a discount i wouldn t come back here anyway and i wouldn t recommend this hotel to anybody from the outside it s really beautiful once passed the doors it s another story
