i stayed at this hotel within the last year and came back because i had such a good experience it looks like it s kept falling downhill the carpet in the elevator is ripping up from the floor i ve already tripped on it times there also seems to be a lot of variation in the rooms our last one was bigger with a bath this one is smaller we had to pay more per night to get a room smaller than the one we stayed in last time and has a shower that s too small to bend your elbow in the staff is okay but didn t go out of their way or be extra friendly construction is going on and we called downstairs when it began at am no one called us back or belayed the construction however when we complained when checking out of the hotel we were comped one free breakfast also per person for breakfast is highway robbery unless it s something more than toast and cakes wifi is good enough to check your email but that s it don t check in here if you ve got business to conduct a skype call for example is impossible i m just pretty disappointed the price is okay it s not bad enough that i moved hotels we were there for a week but i wouldn t come back again
