i booked a executive room for me and my boyfriend when i arrived in the evening and checked in i realised it was single beds pushed together when i asked for a double bed when i called up the next morning i called down to the reception who said that that s the executive room only has single beds and no double bed which i though was ridiculous for a star hotel so they put me in a classic room however explained my mini bar wouldn t be free even though i paid for this benefit with the executive room when i went down to the reception to talk to someone face to face i was ignored for waiting as the two meme era of staff was on there computer and talking amounts themselves once i was acknowledge i explained that i still want to the executive privileges that i paid for they then agreed also breakfast was another disappointment for some cold meats and mediocre hot breakfast would not recommend this hotel unless your happy to put up with the bad customer service and a great location but they re is other hotels with a similar location for less of the price this place is definitely a rip off and when i checked out they tried charging me for a coke from the mini bar which was included in the executive room price overall a let down
