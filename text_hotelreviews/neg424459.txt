this hotel has nothing to do with a four star rating we booked a comfort room and we received a small room of max m wide a bed attached to the wall on the side and a bathroom so small where the towels were hanged right above the toilet we couldn t actually move or get dressed in the room there is no sign and no instructions about parking and we park the car in front of the hotel next to other cars next day we received a parking fee when i asked in the reception what is going on they told me that the parking for the hotel is on the other side of the street i said ok but we should have been told about it or it should have been a sign instructions etc next day they hanged out a paper with instructions for a star hotel in the center of wien it was really dissapointing not to say frustrating and for euro night i would expect a little more we ll never book any austria trend hotel again
