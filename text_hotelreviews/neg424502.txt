after paying a high price due to the location and high demand for the christmas market which is understandable i was charged per day for the use of a kettle which was absurd we had our month old daughter with us and we needed hot water for her bottles the fact that we were charged for the kettle was just unfair and shallow it ruined my whole experience with this hotel chain
