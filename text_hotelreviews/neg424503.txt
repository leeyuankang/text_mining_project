pictures of the rooms are very very deceiving we were shocked at how small the rooms are compared to what the pictures show staff argued that the description of the room says how many square meters the room is which doesnt make much sense as i don t know anyone who says i booked a room in a hotel but i know a lot of people that say the hotel website has amazing pictures i booked it i suggest to put realistic pictures or remove them we were offered a discount for a future booking it won t happen we would have been happy if a discount was offered for this stay not the next one
