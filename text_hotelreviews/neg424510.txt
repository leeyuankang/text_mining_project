the staff was not all smiles and helpful the garage was quite far away there was a few road blocks that day and it made it more difficult to get to the garage and the staff handled it just matter of factly and we had to detour another to get back it s not that near the center of the city about mins walk and the staff didn t give directions on how to get there besides walking we have an elderly couple in our group and an infant more directions and instructions would have been appreciated
