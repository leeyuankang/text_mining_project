the room was a bit dingy and needed brightening up and re decorating the room light where the bed was located had a switch in the entrance part but not where the bed was located there was no bedside light the shower was a section of the entrance room built from a block wall only half the height of the room the wifi was poor you had to cross a dimly lit courtyard to the breakfast room reception desk the reception desk was not manned at all times the smoke alarm kept beeping all night on the last night but the manager did not seem to understand either what the problem was or that i had no sleep because of the noise did not offer a partial refund because of the disturbance i would not stay there at that price only a and just pushing a star hotel
