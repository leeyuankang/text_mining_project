most of the advertised facilities are non existent or not functioning when we arrived we could not find a sole on the premises and no way of contacting anyone we found our name and a key on the reception desk and checked ourselves in definitely self serve and with no security whatsoever as for parking it is on the street out the front for which they charge extra apparently when the pay parking starts between or am depending on what part of the street you park in they will ferry your car to some parking station nearby for a couple of hours until you check out there was no functioning restaurant or coffee lounge on this premises when we were there perhaps the rooms for these exist but they were not open there was no lift in the room the bathroom was part of the entrance hall and had no separate door breakfast was very basic and nowhere near what you would expect from a four star establishment much of the description for this place is inaccurate even to the time it takes to get to the schoenbrunn palace google shows it as minutes not the they try to pretend possibly this is to the back fence but you have to go around to the front gate to get an entry ticket it would be helpful if the hotel is looked at by an independent inspector because as it appears on booking com its advertising is deceptive to say the least the rating is very hard to believe it proved useless to point this out to the manager if you can find her because she is one of the rudest people i have met and of no help whatsoever
