location is questionable shoenbrunn is not walking distance away min to the city center by car no parking though hotel staff tells you different they park you at the sidewalk in front of the hotel but parking inspector will be there in the morning expect a ticket no wifi yes sometimes you can be lucky to get a very low signal but it is really impossible to be normally connected what i really hated is that the hotel management pretended to call technician after my complaint but in reality they know perfectly well the wifi is not useful and do nothing about it guys you either fix it or do not advertise having it breakfast i did not expect much but they succeeded to go below these expectations too do not count on this meal you need to be ready to climb by stairs to the upper levels no elevator available somebody here mentioned good service in this hotel i must call it appearance of service it is just a facade i stayed there because of good score on booking in my opinion this hotel does not deserve it
