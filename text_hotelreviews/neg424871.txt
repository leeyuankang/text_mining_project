whilst the hotel is dog friendly an occasion occurred which demonstrated that a particular staff member on reception was clearly not this is a pity particularly as my daughter arrived in reception with her very small dog on a leash and enquired if she could await us in reception will we came down in the lift the staff member was disapproving of her having the dog in the reception area and when the dog starting panting it was very warm outside a disapproving shuuuussshhh came from a face like fizz my daughter waited outside maybe this staff member missed the brief regards being dog friendly however this incident wouldn t stop future bookings but i d be mindful of this incident occurring again if the staff member in question was on duty
