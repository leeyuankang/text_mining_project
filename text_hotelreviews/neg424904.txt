the hotel describes itself as warm but the interior design of the rooms was cold impersonal and taste less fault of the interior designer rather than the hotel itself but still the rooms were quite sad it is also the most badly sound proofed hotel i have probably ever stayed in if someone was talking in the hallway it felt like they were lying in bed with you the same goes for the windows on the street any noise was ridiculously strong from voices to garbage trucks laughter anything it was really disturbing and i was on the floor the walls were really thin and someone in the building that bordered with my room gave a small house gathering and when people laughed it was literally like having them in bed with me strongly advise against staying there if it s a work trip because you don t get good sleep at least in the room i stayed in also in a four star hotel you expect the cleaning ladies to fold your pajama and not throw it in a ball on the pillow finally i told the staff it is very unhygenic that they place unwashable faux leather pillows that guests tend to put on the floor when going to sleep on the pillows you then proceed to place your face on
