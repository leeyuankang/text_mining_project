breakfast was good although every day the same thing was on the menu so after days it becomes boring the room i satyed at was very small and had a small window to the inside of the building some kind of tunnel so not view neither direct natural light air conditioning was only heating cooling function not working even when putting the temperature low the room became hot and stuffy walls doors are not sound proof so if someone is walking talking on the corridor it felt as if they were inside the room lack of ventilation in the bathroom mold growing in the bath
