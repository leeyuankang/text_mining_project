it was expensive all things considered although there were limited options at lower prices when we were looking months prior to our arrival so perhaps barcelona runs at a premium the room was certainly nice but for over euros night it was not luxurious i found the room to meet expectations of what i usually pay for night in the us and similar to the room we paid night for in madrid
