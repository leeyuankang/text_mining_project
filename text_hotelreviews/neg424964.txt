our room was on the first floor and extremely noisy there was a lot of noise coming from the staff entering and exiting service docks outside noise from trucks and the floors above also the ac was down for scheduled maintenance for a full day during our stay this summer had to replace the key twice as they were deactivated i don t think the price was justified by these qualities
