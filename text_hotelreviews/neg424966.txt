our room had a heavy smell some water was dripping down from the ceiling towards the ground of the shower we told the staff about it however no one took care of it for the nights we stayed at the same room also i forgot my bikinis in the bathroom while checking out after around international phone calls and several e mails the only response i got was we are lookign for it it s been weeks now and yet again noone cares stuff is so so careless and oblivious i cant recommend this hotel any more altough it was my second stay at this place in years i will definitely not stay here ever again
