the single beds move if you try to sit up in bed with back to the wall the double bed was actually two single beds put next to each other the staff was either not well trained or not aware of the level of customer service the hotel management wants to offer here are couple of examples i asked for extra tea bags and creamers at am in the morning there were only two black tea bags and creamers for three of us staying in the family room the receptionist told us the housekeeping will come at am and supply will be replenished then upon emphasising the need this person consulted another staff and agreed to send the supplies immediately i enquired about booking a cab to airport the person at the reception told me there was no need to book a cab he said cabs are available round the corner and can be got in no time not satisfied i again inquired later to another person at the reception he pulled out a booking sheet and put down time cab was required and room no he said he will book the cab i wonder why different responses from different staff
