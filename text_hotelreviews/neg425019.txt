i reserved at the catalonia born after the art gallery cancelled my reservation i would have given this hotel a if it had not been with an issue we had with the room temperature we stayed in october which would usually mean you do not need ac but the heater was keeping the room way too hot you probably would suggest to open the window which we did the problem was the mosquitoes where so many when you opened it that we got bitten all over the body and even in our face i would not have expected the team to have a solution for this on the first night but in a four star hotel i would expect by the second day something like a fan could have been provided to make our stay better everyone was nice its just no one solved the problem i can expect this of a star hotel but not a star
