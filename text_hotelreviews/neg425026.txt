on the first day we went to breakfast later in the allocated time slot and most of the cooked breakfast was cold the staff did offer to cook us fresh hot eggs instead which was nice there is free wifi but it didn t keep connected for long enough to do anything online however they have pcs in the bar for guests so we were able to book tickets etc
