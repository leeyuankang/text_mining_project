first we got a room at the first floor but it was smelly and it had just a tiny window to the interior court we asked for another room we received on at the floor and it was a much better bigger and full of light room but the rooms next door was being redecorated so in the morning there was a lot of noise knocking and loud voices of the workers the price was kind of big and they charge extra for the breakfest
