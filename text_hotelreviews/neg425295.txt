it did not annoy me but for visitors who have problem with noise i would not recommend this hotel since it s in the middle of a very active square especially if you are staying at lower floors you will be feeling the beats as you sleep maybe because i did not book in advance the room rate was extremely high when compared with other european cities but when compared with amsterdam where the room rates are always on the high side it was tolerable wi fi was slow with some interruptions from time to time but sufficient for downloading e mails social media
