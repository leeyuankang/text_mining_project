on arrival we were greeted with payment requirement although we thought we had pre paid so that meant trawling through a load of emails to check as hotel couldn t show us any confirmation either way fair enough but i thought maybe the reception staff member could have been a little warmer welcoming despite booking no smoking room and no smoking signs everywhere on arrival to room it smelt stuffy smelt of smoke we were rushing on business trip had no time to complain as only there for one evening rest of room was clean however
