i requested twin room but they gave me double room without any explanation and when i asked to change they just said they dont have room left and hotel was quite dirty stairs to other floors were so dirty and unpleasant even room was double checked by worker if it is clean but still there were much dust on the furniture and still too expensive for that small and poor quality room
