have stayed at the krasnopolsky before and expected the same hospitality and warmth however we are sorry to say that the reception could handle matters much better with a smile and warmth was not feeling very welcoming especially from sameira who kept us waiting for a long time and was found to be quite rude during checkout to another guest housekeeping did up our beds very well however forgot to empty the trash for days and the bathrooms were not cleaned despite the amenities being stocked up
