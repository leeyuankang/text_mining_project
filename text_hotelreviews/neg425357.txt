the bedroom was large but the bathroom was very cramped we had problem with that we only got hot water in the shower and a night light that flashed constantly we told the reception but nothing was done we asked for a new room after one night s stay and got it right away the cleaning of our room was miserable towels were worn sheets were not changed and the room was pretty dirty the mattresses were worn out and the beds hurts to be in there was a lot of noise from the street but you have to expect that when you have room facing the street in the middle of town we would recommend guests to request rooms to the backyard all in all we think not the hotel offers value for money when we pay euros per night for a double room
