first of all when we got there they asked for a credit card in order to take out euros as a guarantee we are students so we only had a debit card they told us that they can take euros out of the debit card and give it back in cash when we checked out but they conveniently forgot to mention that there is a city tax and instead of euros they would give us which was a problem cause we had calculated those euros for food before we left so we spent hours at the airport not having money to eat second our room faced a wall third the second day we were there we left the room to get some breakfast at about we came back at and there was a paper in front of the door saying that there would be no water from to due to maintenance reasons two persons had to shower in minutes because they couldn t take the time to notify us earlier or from the night before third probably due to those maintenance reasons that we were never notified about in the first place when we checked in every morning at about o clock there was terrible noise from drills and i don t know what else i wouldn t go back to that hotel on my next visit at amsterdam
