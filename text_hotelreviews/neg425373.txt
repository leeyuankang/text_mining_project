the only bad things about this hotel were quite trivial the price of the hotel isnt exactly cheap at average of per night but amsterdam is a horrible place if you get the hotel wrong which is very easy to do so it s worth paying a little extra to guarantee a luxury stay the only other complaint i had was that it is very dimly lit in the rooms and you might be waiting a while for the lift as there seemed to be only one
