room was an attic room which was way too small and did not have air conditioning although a fan was provided there was one window that you couldn t get at to open while to open the other you had to stoop very low there was a burn mark caused by a hot iron in the carpet and though bathroom was also tiny it was adequate the room was not the room i thought i had reserved and when i mentioned this to the receptionist i checked in with she said they were fully booked and could not give me an alternative room the hotel in general was very tired looking and in need of a good makeover when asked on checking out if i enjoyed my stay iinformed the receptionist on duty of my overall disappointment and they offered me a taxi transfer to the airport which was appreciated overall though a very disappointing hotel in an excellent location
