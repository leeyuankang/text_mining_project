i had requested one soft mattress and one firm when booking i mentioned this on check in but the receptionist was so disorganised it took minutes to check in although i had booked weeks before i don t think she understood then she said it would be possible and they would see to it then i had a call to say it was not possible so i got in touch with housekeeping and requested extra duvets over the mattress which made the bed a little softer but it was uncomfortable for me all three nights my wife was ok with her firm bed bizarrely the restaurant is not available from about onwards as a tv current affairs programme is broadcast from there daily actually it didn t matter to us as the notable art deco interior of the room has been ruined by the recent addition of banks of bright neon lights quite scandalous the bathroom was very antiquated it s a long time since i have seen an overbath shower with a plastic curtain if the enormous s radiator with exposed pipework had been removed there would almost be room for a proper walk in shower there were no toilet rolls only a tissue dispenser there was no air con and the fan provided did not work the lift probably dates from the s as well i will take only people at a pinch and the door has to be opened manually frankly for an hotel with this rating it is well below expected international standards although the remaining art deco features are well worth seeing and the location is good there is very little else that is positive which can be said
