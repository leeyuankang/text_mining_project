this hotel is very far from being a star hotel at first glance when you enter it looks lovely but once you leave the reception area and head towards the lifts to go to your room it becomes grotty dirty and well past it s sell by date our stay in amsterdam was a present from myself to my husband for our wedding anniversary and i can definitely say one that we will never forget amsterdam is wonderful and unforgettable this hotel is awful and definitely will not be forgotten but for all the wrong reasons the lift walls and floor the corridor walls and floor where all dirty and stained and the room floors and walls were the same there was a layer of dust on everything in the room which remained for all of our stay and was never cleaned the enamel sink in the bathroom was very badly cracked and chipped and there was a thick layer of lime scale around the taps and shower head the bed linen was never changed during our stay despite an accidental spill of coke on the bed which left considerable stains on the sheet and pillow case this is definitely not a star hotel and would struggle to be a bad star now to top all of this off monday to friday the only area in the hotel for food and drink in the evening time becomes a tv studio and guests are unable to obtain the normal services that you would expect to be available for hotel guests unbelievable if we had wanted to stay in a bed and breakfast or a hostel we would have paid a bed and breakfast price or a hostel price not what we paid yes we got a slightly better price by going through booking com but we still paid the asking price for as we thought a good standard of hotel next time can i believe what booking com tells me
