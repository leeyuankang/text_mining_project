requested a double room but when we arrived we were told that the double rooms available would not be suitable because of their proximity to a green room being used for hr filming purposes we were offered a really grotty twin room instead which my girlfriend burst in to tears upon seeing so i had no choice but to pay for an upgrade complained to booking com but never heard back feel extorted and will not use either nh shiller or booking com again in the future
