room lay out was a bit tight but that was just our room the room next door was fine the only other thing was the hotels neighbours were of the herbal essence kind but wasnt an issue as our room was on the back of the hotel no view but if your looking out your window at amsterdam your wasting the experience of being there i would probably advise a room on the rear due the building opposite having a advertising screen the size of a modest bedroom detached house i can imagine that would cause an ever changing irritating glow through the curtains unless they are super thick ours was reasonbly thick but dont think they would hide that sign would not put me off the hotel as the benefit from the view from the front would out way it
