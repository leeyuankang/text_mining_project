i arrived late so the only rooms available were above rembrandtplein the windows did not have double glazing against the noise at the wind started blowing and i was woken up by the noise of the flagpole outside my window banking around in its socket i was able to transfer to another room in the back at in this room the bathroom floor flooded each time i took a shower because the shower curtain is not long enough also each time i showered the water went from too cold to too hot and back again every seconds when checking out i told the reception about all this and was given a discount even after the discount the price was a bit under euros per night i don t think i got value for money and did not expect this of a nh hotel
