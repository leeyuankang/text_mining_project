some staff are not engaging with customers borderline rude wasn t impressed with not being able to access bar on our first night because of some radio show room we were given was no bigger than a matchbox and as we found out later that night was from radio show after party lots of shouting and banging doors at in the morning the room was also freezing cold because heavy curtains block radiator which you have to keep closed as room is overlooked by other windows in some alleyway we rang down for another bed cover as the one on the bed was paper thin we were moved to another appropriate room for our second night which better reflected the cost advoid room at all cost if you have to stay in this room your bill should be discounted also they do not communicate that they charge euro mini bar deposit on your card when you check in that still hasn t been returned as we did not use minibar
