the attention to details in terms of cleanliness on the surface it looks clean however i suggest that the housekeeping supervisor go for spot checks the toilet brush is very old rusty and dirty glasses are not replaced and the bed sheets are not turned over i stayed on the first floor so my room was noisy due to the tv show live broadcast from the ground floor except weekends please take my comment as a constructive feedback i really loved your hotel and i would probably book it again due to the location friendliness of the staff and the customer service
