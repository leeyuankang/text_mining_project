the rooms are small and any rooms to the front of the hotel are extremely noisy i specifically requested a room away from lifts and stairs and in a quite part of the hotel when i made the initial booking i was allocated a room directly beside a lift and stairs when we arrived when i went to reception and requested a room away from lifts and stairs i was given a room at the front of the hotel which turned out to be very noisy at night it was that bad cleaning staff left ear plugs beside each bed everyday
