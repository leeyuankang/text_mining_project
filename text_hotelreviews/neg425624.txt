there is a televised live show that takes place monday to friday with bands etc in the restaurant i didn t see this advertised when booking and would have liked to i was up on the floor and could hear the loud band it usually finishes up around midnight also if your room is facing the square prepare for a loud enough night the hotel is surrounded by lots of bars
