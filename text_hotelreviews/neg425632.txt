i can only recommend location the hotel is pretty old and smells rooms are not even similar to the pics on booking com rooms are pretty small and really dirty the money you will pay is not worth it all stuffs are really rude and not friendly i visited amsterdam four times and the last hotel experience was the worst let me explain like this me and my girlfriend were staying in nh schiller and my two friends of mine staying across the street of my hotel which is nh caransa both of the hotels are located same location and same owner so during our staying second day some thief got into the room and stole louis vuitton bag passport hermes belt and more stolen stuff cost at least thousand euros and we went downstairs to complain to front desk they did not even call police because of their reputation they told us to go police station we have nothing to do and only house keeping got into room and supervisor and they already know we are leaving tomorrow they did not search anybody or watch cameras even they want to watch the cameras they don t have any cameras on the floors they told us we didn t lock the door thats how they defense themselves it doesn t make sence for me to spend for night in star hotel and some one came to stole my stuff in the hotel room so why am i staying in star hotel and pay more i rather to go stay in some hostel for euros do not go this hotel in both of the locations they are organized thief they don t have a camera for purpose on the floors so this is my experience of this hotel save your money go stay in different hotel
