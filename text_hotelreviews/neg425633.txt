the hotel ruined the weekend for us they got our booking completely wrong on arrival all of our party were two sharing in twin rooms and we had a set rate per room which we all budgeted for when we arrived many were put in single occupancy rooms which not only carries a different charge but means people were separated and caused all sorts of confusion most importantly the charging for each room was completely out and one of our party was charged twice which currently is still not resolved with the hotel not looking to resolve i will be making a formal complaint
