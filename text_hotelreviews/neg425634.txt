i didn t event sleep in the hotel where i booked a room i was sent to the one opposite in the street that had no charm at all i got a free upgrade it would have been a scandal otherwise but the room i got didn t even have a double bed just two single beds my boyfriend and i didn t really enjoy to sleep separately on holiday and the terrace wasn t clean because there were cigarette butts on the floor and the hand cream sample in the bathroom had already been used by someone before we arrived we won t return for sure
