was really disappointed with the room it was tiny just enough room for a double bed because of the pictures on here i feel a bit deceived due to it costing for nights it also smelt damp from the bathroom and it was soo hot i was sweating getting ready we asked to be moved but the hotel was fully booked so they sent us a fan instead as there s no air con wouldn t book again
