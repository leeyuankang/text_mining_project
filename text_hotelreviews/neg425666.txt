i put a sign on the door in request the bedroom was made up when leaving in the morning all was done was a change of towels and the sign taken off the door why wasn t the bedroom even attempted to have been made up especially when it s claimed as and the price tag also i asked about where i would be able to print something off for that evening the woman kindly said to email them and they ll sort it out i emailed the letter i needed printing and hadn t heard anything for a few hours so went downstairs and another girl acted completely clueless even when i explained everything to her she found said email and couldn t figure out how to print the document needed off why she didn t ask for a manager is beyond me so i left in a state of panic that evening luckily it all fell into place without the letter
