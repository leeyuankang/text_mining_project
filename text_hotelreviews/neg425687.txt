there was maintenance going on in the lobby when we arrived so had to come through the side door our room was down some really steep stairs and even though i had booked a double we had two single beds pushed together and two single duvets the breakfast could have been a bit broader especially for the price we were paying the most annoying thing that you are not made aware of when booking which would of made us not book this hotel is we were not made aware and it s not advertised that the bar would be close on week nights due to filming a local tvs show we wouldn t have booked it if we had known the hotel rooms could do with updating i think the hotel is over priced
