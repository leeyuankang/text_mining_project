i stayed for one night in a single room and while it was serviceable and clean it was a little run down nothing terrible but you can tell the hotel has been used and hasn t been renovated in a while my windows also were not double paned so the night s festivities on rembrandtplein did get a little loud i can sleep through noise so it didn t bother me but it s worth noting but honestly for the price and for the location i would absolutely recommend it if you re looking for luxury pay way more for another hotel
