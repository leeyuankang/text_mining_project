we had a lovely room in the front with a beautiful view over amsterdam but unfortunately the city has allowed times square style advertising panels to be installed with huge flashing lights just across the square from the hotel which lights up the top rooms in the front of the hotel so bright that is resembles daylight and was impossible to sleep the hotel is aware of this as they tried to fight it and so they immediately moved us to a room in the back which was much better the staff was very understanding and accommodating
