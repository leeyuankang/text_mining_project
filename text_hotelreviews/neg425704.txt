asked for a high room with a view put on the second floor at the back looking at a roof asked to be moved and told it was full after a bit of complaining we was moved to the front of the hotel with a great view of the square was warned about the noise but went ahead anyway as my wife loves the hustle and bustle and lovely views it was however very very noisy there was earplugs next to the bed nice touch which we made use of the second night was a lot quieter due to the rain and the wind but we was then kept awake by the clanging of the massive flagpole that was right outside our window the wind was going for it and the pole was clanging in its clamps sending shock waves into the room we also had booked a superior room but only a standard was left so we was refunded the difference i d say the worst point of this hotel was the bar they have a live tv show broadcast from here every weeknight so the bar is taken over after the show you can get a drink only until this is pitiful for such a big hotel but it gets worse on the saturday night it closes at i have never been to such a big so called chain hotel and not been able to get a drink as a resident
