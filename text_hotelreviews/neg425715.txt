the hotel is old in so many ways the mattress is the worst in the world we both have back aches and we could barely sleep then the pillows were so old that they didn t have the shape nor the feel of a pillow they were chunky we were sleeping in different rooms so it wasn t only one room problem the toilets don t have a working ventilation so imagine how the room smels too expensive for what you get will never come back again
