the only downside was the room it was absolutely freezing in the bathroom and we only got the room cleaned once the whole time we were there so nothing was really cleaned or changed when they did come in they made the bed but didn t actually clean or tidy anything including cups we had for cups of tea also they were coming to clean at o clock when we d been out all day
