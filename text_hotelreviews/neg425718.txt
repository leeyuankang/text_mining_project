we ve booked rooms in the nh schiller in may via booking com but day before our stay dec the hotel called us to say they didn t had any room in this hotel and they had to replace us to the caransa after some dicussions as we weren t very happy about that fact ve ve got a discount upgrade standard to superior room and a free small lunch with cava for people anyway some people remained really disappointed due to the unprofessional handling of our reservation by nh we believe that it wasn t a mistake but that they could sell our rooms in the schiller for a much higher price to other people if that s the nh policy i don t know if our group will stay at nh the next time dependent on the floor and room you stay the rooms can be very noisy due to the loud music from the neighbours and renovation was badly done
