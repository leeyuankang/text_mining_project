we ve booked superior double room and were appalled by the room which was given to us it had a tiny window and looked nothing like on the pics after a complaint we were given a room with dust on table and shelves and a frame of what has to be a window filled with something and covered by a curtain we complained again and were given a much better one together with free breakfast the last room was what it supposed to be but it took a lot of effort and complaining to get it
