we had a substantial leak from the ceiling in our bathroom the maintenance staff were very prompt in attending the reception staff one person did not offer a new room she said we will do whatever you wish so we had to ask for a replacement room which in the event was slightly smaller when i asked the receptionist if she would like to stay in a room with a bathroom in that condition she said it is not for me to decide this is a star hotel when we explained this to the manager he apologised i presume that due to the change of rooms two charges for services we did not use were erroneously added to our bill the manager again sorted this out and apologised other reception staff were very friendly and helpful
