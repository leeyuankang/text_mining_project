beds not very comfortable we had to have our room key reactivate twice a bit of a pain as our room was on the floor no reason for it not to work as we kept it away from phone etc the shower bathtub can be somewhat difficult to get in and out of if you have any issues a bit pricey but you are paying for a great location we only had breakfast one morning it was ok but expensive lots of cafes close by that have a great breakfast menu for less money
