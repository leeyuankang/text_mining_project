the bathroom was below par needs modernising and bringing into the century double glazing would have helped to block out some of the noise from the square which continued most of the night although the room had been serviced our tea and coffee facilities were not cleaned or replenished and we had to contact reception i had requested a twin bedded room as i was visiting with a friend the beds were together with no room to separate them i requested a superior room and expected better facilities for the money i would have given this hotel a star rating not a star
