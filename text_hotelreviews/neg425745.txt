the room was very small we requested a room at the back after reading reviews of considerable noise in the early hours of the morning when the club next door closed however it was pretty noisy and not pleasant view and smelly from the kitchens deliveries etc i would expect a hotel to replenish the tea and coffee supplies in the room each day and to provide for more than cup per person
