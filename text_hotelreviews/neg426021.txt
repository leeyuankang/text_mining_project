the room was terribly small i m not usually one to moan about a small room especially in amsterdam where the buildings are very narrow by nature so you have to expect some degree of closeness but this was way beyond that the room we stayed in for a very expensive per night was the size of a utility cupboard from back home the bed barely fit you had of space at the side of the bed you had to squeeze down and then shimmy across to your side on very claustrophobic feeling not worth per night towards the end of our trip we stayed in a budget hotel for euros per night which was triple the size room wise
