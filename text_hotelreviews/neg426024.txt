for the money we paid to stay here for one night in the smallest room possible and no balcony we should have gone elsewhere and the credit card which was used to pay for this was presented as requested but still we were unable to use it as the person whose name it was in my wife who paid for this for us was not present the card was but not my wife even worse on check out we overheard a poor traveller being denied his booking simply because he had to replace his card with a new one as the strip had worn out very disappointed and will not stay here again
