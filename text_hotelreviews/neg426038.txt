staff were terrible we didn t pre pay and accidentally ticked the breakfast option on booking com we advised the hotel at check in who made us feel like it was a big problem but will be sorted they made us pay a bond for our time in the hotel on check out they deducted the breakfasts costs from the bond which we never ate during our stay we felt robbed the staff were very rude and very unhelpful be warned
