the only thing we didn t like was the terribly offensive odour in the elevator and hallways the lobby and room were fine never any odour there but the rest of the hotel smelled like you had your face in a cat litter box it was brutal at times thankfully it never seemed to follow us to the room or linger on clothes but it was very strong any time we rode the elevator and in hallways near the stairs
