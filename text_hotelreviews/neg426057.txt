the hotel is built on a very small area so the rooms are rather small the toilets and shower areas are rather narrow and restricted i couldn t find a socket to plug in my mobile charger the hotel is good for a business trip or a bunch of friends who will spend most of their time outside and come back to the room to sleep i thought it was a little bit expensive if you are a family of parents and restless kids or a couple looking for a luxurious few days then look elsewhere
