walls are thin i was staying with my young son years old and we heard the people in the room next door fighting during the day and heard everything they were doing at night ugh we nearly complained room is very small but ok if you are out most of the day sightseeing because the room is tastefully designed and bed is comfortable when we were leaving we checked under the bed to see if we had left anything behind the cleaning staff need to take care to clean under beds more despite a few complaints i would stay here again it was a nice hotel
