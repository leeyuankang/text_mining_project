i booked a room for myself and sisters it was a superior room with double beds but it was only set up for people so we had to ask for everything extra i e towels tea and coffee toiletries which was a bit annoying we booked well in advance so it wasn t like they didn t know we were arriving that was the only downside of our stay as the hotel is lovely and it wouldn t put us of staying again
