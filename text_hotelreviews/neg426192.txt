we have received a room for handicapped people right above the frequent street even though the garage was nearly empty for extra furthermore i ordered room with double bed instead of single beds and explicitly write this in my order confirmation and still we had single beds for the first time i was very unhappy with my accommodation and i would definitely not recommend this hotel it was worth half the price maybe less not euros for a night
