when arriving they did not have a room i requested with a king size bed but instead only a twin room they offered to push the beds together but that is not the point pillows are extremely thin and soft so you literally need pillows to be even remotely comfortable breakfast is sub standard for a star hotel with only kinds of cereal and un edible eggs there we no toillettries in the bathroom and you had to call to have those brought to you tea coffee facilities are not standard in the room and must be paid for additionally rooms facing renweg street are very noisy and you can t sleep with a window open which is why i requested a quiet room but when i arrived there were none available
