very over priced stated as a four star and in my opinion not even close room floor squeaked every where was annoying unless you made it a game to try and walk from bed to bath without squeaking not possible room given was not the room pictured in the ad when i reserved as junior suite not even close although i was told on site it was one of the best buyer beware shower bath access was difficult and i am very agile the tub rim to step over was to my knee caps and i am so if you are short good luck
