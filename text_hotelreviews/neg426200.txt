the washstand was blocked the soap dispenser didn t work maybe too full the ledge where the hairdryer was was full of dust we also would have liked to have shower caps on sunday the room was not done when we returned late p m we needed meals in the hotel as i couldn t walk much but weekends are bad for that and in that neighborhood all restaurants are closed at that time so we had to have a meal in the renaissance hotel nearby
