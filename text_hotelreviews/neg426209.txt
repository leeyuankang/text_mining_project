we asked to book two rooms both with one large bed and one with extra bed as a result we got two rooms with two separate beds and there was no extra bed in the room where we asked to put it why do we use this booking com form to give in advance some special requirements other general impressions the hotel blocks on your credit card not only the accomodation price but security deposit per each day of your stay at check out the hotel withdraws accomodation plus extra expeneses parking bar minibar etc and unblocks the amount blocked at check in this can be an issue for guests from ukraine as naks do not unblock these money immediately sometimes it takes up to days therefore it would be great if recpetion informs on this action prior to blocking the money poor wifi no breakfast was included breakfast at additional cost is overpriced it is cheaper to eat at salm brau cold bathroom and extremely cold wc room minibar is empty no bathrobes and slippers it is strange for the hotel like this but my towel had holes and was age worn bartender at the bar in the lobby was somewhere out of the bar all the time
