my room was near the cleaning office and i was somehow forced to wake up every morning at am when the cleaning lady started her job and opened and closed the door i had to leave one night earlier although it was paid and no refund was allowed and check in in another hotel just to have some rest in the morning on the other hand no shower kit no tooth paste no slippers and bathrobe only if you paid extra though it is a stars hotel
