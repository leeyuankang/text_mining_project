this was once a wonderful hotel but now it s a disaster staff is unfriendly and unqualified the cleaning is terrible dust everywhere one evening we ve returned to the room just to discover bathrobes and used towels casually thrown on our suitcases the rooms are in poor condition plus the information on the booking com doesn t match the reality it s said that the rooms are equipped with mini bars but they have removed them and now it s just a fridge in the room also we ve booked a room with a king size bed instead we got twin beds when we asked for a room that we ve booked they said that there is no such thing i say they must change the information on the web site otherwise it s just a fraud overall very poor service it s really strange because this hotel was once a very nice place to stay
