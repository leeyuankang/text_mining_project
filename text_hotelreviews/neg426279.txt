the hotel was very busy all the time during my stay nights which is not a problem in general unfortunatly there was mostly just person at the reception who was responsible for check in and check out calling taxis and helping the guests with anything else i wanted to order some food for my room which is not possible since they do not have a restaurant in the hotel they recommended to order from an asian restaurant the one where they have the menu was finally closed then they promised to find another restaurant where they would order for me finally they told me i should go to the internet and find something for myself the smell in my room was like being in a hospital unfortunatly i needed a ironing board which they brought to my room quickly this board was so old that i was afraid to iron my silk dress on it finally every morning at breakfast i told them that one of their fruit salads already got alcoholic sorry for all my criticism but this was really a bad experience the building is actually a nice one but management of the hotel can improve a lot
