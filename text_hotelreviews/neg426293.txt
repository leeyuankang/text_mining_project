i found it quite annoying having to use the garage in the other building quite inconvenient with the suitcases especially if the weather is bad the carpets are old and used and there are stains all over the place whole room stank of cleaning solvents hydrochloric acid which was quite annoying as it was impossible to sleep i realise the cleanliness is important and that the best way to disinfect everything is using it but the stench was unbearable it was everywhere in the bed linens the whole room really annoying besides that i am sure it is not recommended for a person to inhale those amounts on a daily basis
