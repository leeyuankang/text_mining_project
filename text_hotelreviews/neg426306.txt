i stayed at a room at the front of the hotel there is a lot of road noise the bathroom is tiny and there is no kettle you need to pay for warm water to make some tea the hotel does not offer room service i would not rate this hotel as a four star a few days earlier i stayed at the nh danube city although this hotel is from the same chain it was miles better next time i visit vienna i will stay there again
