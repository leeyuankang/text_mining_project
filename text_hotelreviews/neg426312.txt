i have put down a complaint on the nh belvedere hotel in vienna on the booking site booking com we arrived at am at the hotel we gave the receptionist a knowledge that we are here for check in and that we are fully aware that the check in is not until pm we left the laguage in their safety room and left for a sightseeing of vienna we even in the morning pointed out for the smoking rooms the booking form clearly states smoking rooms when we came back for the check in at pm they gave us the keys and wanted to send us away in our rooms since the lobby was full of people clearly waiting for check in at exactly pm and not a minute earlier when i asked if the rooms are smoking they said oh noooo we only have smoking rooms and they are already taken when i tried to explain that we need smoking rooms not beacuse of caprice but beacuse of need the trainee at the reception not the receptionist said that s not her concern and not her problem if i knew that my booking request would not be met i would booked a hotel elsewhere a hotel with a terrace and the girl at the reception said than wait for the girl from this morning to come it s not my problem i am a trainee here so we took the rooms in order not to wait longer i am absolutely stunned from the behaviour of the stuff i have oral presentation tomorrow on a conference and now i can t focus on my work it is obviously not useful if i state that i want a smoking room in my booking form when nobody respects that wifi is terrible in my room on the first floor the connection was on and off all the time my room was faced towards the street so i couldn t sleep well it was very noisy and i felt every vehicle crossing down the street
