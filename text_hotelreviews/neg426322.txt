on jun my husband got an allergy attack so i needed to call a our medical insurance coris very urgent to get him attention i couldnt make the phone call directly from my room so i call reception to do it for me a woman called mirella answered the phone and in a very quick almost rude way said sorry madam i cannot help you with that right now i was asking for a medical urgent situation to sum up same day very late doctor came cause another person from the staff called he got an injection and was bad enough to be taken to hospital but thanks god the doctor was great and treated him in our room so my review is that this person shouldnt work in the front desk of a very well known an important hotel like nh she is not capable to deal with guests i have been all around the world in different hotels and something like that never happened to me
