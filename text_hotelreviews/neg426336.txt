i was staying here on business for first nights and my wife stayed with me and we continued our stay for more nights it took me like minutes to explain the reception lady what to charge on company bill and what on private and in the process she had done it all wrong and then reluctantly done it again with a comment that my case is very complicated i wanted her to charge first nights for me on company bill and the additional charge for another person plus the entire expense of the second nights on a private bill what s so vomplicated about that am i to assume that noone else splits the bill in this hotel unbelievable
