toilet looked like it hadn t been bleached for not my usual experience of a hilton hotel took me minutes to contact the reception desk and when finally through to request rooms side by side the agent hung up on me upon arrival the booking i had on my email clearly said rooms but on arrival they only had one room ready so the other room was on a different corridor after requesting side by side rooms wouldn t book a hilton again after this
