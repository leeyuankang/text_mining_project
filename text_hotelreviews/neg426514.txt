the reservation process through bookings com this was the first time i have had trouble with a reservation there were mixed up charges and rooms that took a few weeks to straighten out but the hotel worked with us and corrected everything before we arrived the lounge dinner menu is not kid friendly we had hoped to eat in the hotel restaurant after a day of touring but the fine dining menu left us looking for something else if you re traveling over easter a lot of places are closed
