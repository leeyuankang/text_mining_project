although front desk help were friendly they were not always knowledgable or helpful for the tourist for example we asked about bus transportation and were told we could buy a ticket on the bus this is not true but the bus driver was very kind and gave us the ride to the metro anyway we were also not told that a good option would be to purchase a hour ticket for a full day of travel which they knew were our plans this would have been helpful also the modern decor was a little bland and lacked character
