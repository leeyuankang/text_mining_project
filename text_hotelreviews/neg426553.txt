we asked for a kettle to the room and a male member of staff came to the room with it but was very annoyed when i requested cups and some milk which he did bring and we were grateful but i was taken back by his manner and that he was so annoyed as this was not his job he was very annoyed which made me chuckle his response was very over the top one night we had a beautiful meal in the bar and the following night i ordered the same meal the chicken was not cooked enough for me so asked the bar tender could he ask the kitchen to cook it more and again he was annoyed at this request and when the meal was returned to me they sent it back with the bite i had taken still missing so they literally sent back the same food which still tasted terrible so i just left it this is a star hotel to me there was not star service from some of the staff the reception area is large and spacious but lacks warmth or character nto a problem just a note all in all great value great location i would return
