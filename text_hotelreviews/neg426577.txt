we stayed during a cold period and complained about the room being cold and when the concierge checked we were told that the only form of room heating is via the radiator in the bathroom so leave the bathroom door open this is not at all adequate for a hotel and especially when working late at the desk next to the full height window it is really uncomfortably cold and needed to work in dressing gown
