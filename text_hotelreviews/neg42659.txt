it got very cold in our rooms at night and the heater in our room never worked despite asking for help no member of staff came along to assist us we stayed for a period of two nights and days our shower only had hot water to bathe with on the first day and it was ice cold for the next two no help was provided once again you would expect better customer service than this from a hilton brand
