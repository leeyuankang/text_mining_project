the staff were absolutely appalling i arrived at am and asked to check in was told that checking in is at pm and i would have to wait until they call me if an available room arises i waited for and a half hours at the hotel exhausted without any sleep from the long flight and no phone call was made i got up and went to the reception almost drooling in exhaustion and i gently spoke excuse me i ve been waiting for and a half hours and no one called me can you check if there is an available room by now the absolutely appalling reply came well i cannot kick guests out of the hotel for you shocked i replied obviously i realize that i m not an idiot and there s no reason for you to speak in this way i need you to check if there s an available room that s it she suddenly checks the computer and says well there s a room available on floor two is floor two suitable the insanity of this conversation is enough for me to never come back to this hotel
