i didn t lie the parking prices per night and i hotel like this one should provide free parking for its customers also i didn t like the breakfasts only few choices and it s was average to be honest also i didn t like the bedding in the rooms if you chose a king size you will have two beds aunt two mattresses and two blankets joiend together as king size bed together otherwise the hotel is wonderful
