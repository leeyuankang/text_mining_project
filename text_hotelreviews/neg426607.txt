the reception staff weren t particularly friendly or helpful no help was offered to take our cases to our room when we first arrived also if you have a fear of lifts this isn t the hotel for you this is the first hotel i ve ever stayed in where there wasn t the option of using stairs to get to your room the emergency staircase led outside and not to the rooms my mum and i were forced to use the lift which created an anxiety which we d have preferred not to have on holiday we wouldn t return there for this reason lovely quiet room though and very comfy beds no dressing gowns or slippers and no tea coffee making facilities in the room
