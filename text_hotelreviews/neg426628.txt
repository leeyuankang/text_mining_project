good tv channels but everything was dubbed in german so we couldnt watch a movie once the kids fell asleep i also thought the room service charge of every time was a bit pricey since we ordered every night the room service menu and bar food menu were a bit limited with food but besides that everything was great we loved the hotel and the location
