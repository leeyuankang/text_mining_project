the staff was quite rude and i am not use to that kind of treatment they were not helpful and did not help in any way and being a solo traveler this really impacted my stay in vienna do not come here if you do not speak german and if you are alone you will receive poor treatment vienna is a beautiful city but my stay at this hotel almost ruined my trip
