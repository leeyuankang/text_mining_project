the staff of the hotel is a bit wooden it s as if politeness is forced on them like they don t really enjoy their jobs we didn t have any negative experience really but you d just expect a bit more polite cheerful attitude from a hotel of this caliber also the fact that there s no real double bed in the rooms is a bummer
