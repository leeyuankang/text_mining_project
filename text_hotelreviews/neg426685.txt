the restaurant and bar staff need to try harder for being professional while paying a waitress asked my name and room number and then said this is not your room i had to explain her that she has not seen my first name on the system and her behavior is rude she appologized then another waiter asked me do you know what to want to eat before handing the menu in these were minor problems though generally the hotel is of high standard in my oponion
