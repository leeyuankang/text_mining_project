i don t mind buffet breakfast but having stayed at other hilton hotels i much prefer hot fresh tea and coffee served to the table having hot flasks of water on the end of the buffet tables was naff people open the flasks to pour the water and forget to fasten them then the water goes cold it may be expected in the travel lodge to mess about with water flasks to get your own drink but not the hilton this could be improved
