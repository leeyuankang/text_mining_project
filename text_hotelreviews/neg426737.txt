just few recommendations i stayed in an executive room with a coffee machine for which special capsules were needed that could not be found in the supermarket our coffee capsules finished of them and no new ones were ever left we stayed for five days i have already made a recommendation in my previous reviews to replace the machine with a simple electric cattle which can be used for making tea and coffee without special capsules often the used cups or taken away and no clean ones were left which made us use plastic cups from the fitness the same cups are to be used for both tea and coffee they are ok for coffee but way too small for tea it would be good to have at breakfast and in the rooms two types of cups mugs for tea and smaller cups for coffee it would be nice to have more and newer machines in the fitness
