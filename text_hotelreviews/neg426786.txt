although this is a not exactly a bad thing more on like a bit of cribbing on my part and would not change my opinion about the hotel or my experience but the ac in our room didn t actually work all that great the summer this year in vienna was quite high for europe so we felt it and it wasn t fun when we came back to our hotel room to find that the temp we had set never actually even reached what we had set it to for the entire stay also again though really not important it would be nice to get some other tv channels in english other than just your regular news channels
