the reception staff were not very helpful the first girl directed us to the second closest tram stop she also didn t ask to validate parking at checkout both minor things but i was traveling alone with a small child so every extra step we had to take outside in the cold was that much more difficult i feel like at this price point breakfast should be included especially since there are no breakfast restaurants within walking distance there wwas only bar food available at night which was very inconvenient since only one restaurant is waking distance the parking lot while free was also small and full i was afraid to leave the lot and risk not being able to find another spot
