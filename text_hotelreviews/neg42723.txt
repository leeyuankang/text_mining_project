staff attentiveness calls to reception or front desk are never picked up have to go down and talk to the staff personally to ask simple things because phones are not answered also we requested for a taxi for in the afternoon to the airport the staff called us and woke us up from sleep at in the morning to tell us taxi has arrived he then apologized of course but mistakes like these can be avoided
