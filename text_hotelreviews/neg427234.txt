there was nothing exept shampoo even no body lotion always wet in the bathroom no heating during the summer towels always wet because of that we had to change them every time that s not ecologically friendly location is not convinient for tourist travelling for sightseeing quite far away of the city center min by foot by tram seems to be it is good for business travellers seminars or for the organised groups not easy to find from the st marx metro station
