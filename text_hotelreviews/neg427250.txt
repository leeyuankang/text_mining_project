the location while the u bahn is about a twenty minute walk away it isn t the most pleasant area of town being a new area and still being built this doesn t effect the high standard of the room we had but it s not somewhere you can just walk out of and walk to the main sight seeing areas in vienna the restaurant they recommend and have on the website is closed on weekends we did find one about twenty minutes walk away which was good as an alternative at the arsenal
