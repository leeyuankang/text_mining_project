one of the waiteress did not speak english i mean how can you possibly have stuff anywhere in the hotel that goes into contact with your guests that has no clue about english i have enjoyed my stay at your hotel very much but this was shocking for me lady looked at me like i am crazy that i am talking to her in english person who was doing map for parking come on i have recieved wrong instructions on the reception and spent literally minutes looking for parking reason was that map is very unrealistic and stupid and yes i know it was right next to hotel but i was asking people around hotel nobody was able to tell me even though we were right next to it
