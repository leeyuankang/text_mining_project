returned to get ready for an early evening concert to find room not cleaned etc no real apology from desk staff not told what was happening no complaint form available when requested a cup of tea while we waited would have been a nice gesture during our wait heard other guests complaining about the same situation and they were in a suite not a four star experience whilst the room was spacious the bathroom left a lot to be desired access to a small sink was in a gap about inches wide down the side of the bath with a shower screen further reduced by a heated towel rail that projected approx inches on the wall side the choice was between bump or burn
