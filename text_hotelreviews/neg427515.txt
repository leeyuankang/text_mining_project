the fish cake from the room service menu made me ill not only ruined my stay at the hotel but ruined my entire weekend i was sick all weekend and although the hotel said they would investigate what happened with the food they haven t got in touch with me also i had to check out hours late due to feeling so tired and throwing up all morning and i still was expected to pay for the late check out which i didn t mind so much but it just made the checking out process take even longer i wish i never booked worst experience at a spa to leave sick stressed and upset disgusted with management for no follow up call or email before the bad room service food i was actually planning on returning again with a lot more prebooked treatments now i am just upset that one night which was meant to be something for me to destress had ruined my weekend off
