the first room wasn t ready on arrival but we had a complimentary drink at the bar with friendly bar service which made up for the short wait access to tv movies music didn t work in the first room so we were given another room same size would prefer to have pay for view movies for a set time and to be able to access several movies if i want in that time as opposed to paying for each movie individually and inserting credit card details in each time would rather pay with the bill at the end of my stay the second room had damp carpet near the bed they must have had it spot cleaned however it dried after a few hours
