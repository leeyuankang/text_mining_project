this is not a spa hotel it is falsely advertised the spa is at extra cost which although stated in the small print is not made clear until tounget there plus the spa is tiny fits about people in so you pay out for a very poor service indeed the interior is very dated in many places whatever the original hotel was it s still got a massive impact on the general feel and look of the hotel couldn t get through to room service at all sound system in the room didn t work you have to pay for all movies which in a hotel of this price should be inclusive poor hotel generally
