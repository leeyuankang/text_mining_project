i was told there was parking available but we arrived on the day before a shepherds bush festival so the hotel car park was closed this meant getting across the renowned sb roundabout mins metres to the metropolis called westfield parking unless you are a local this is a massive engagement just to figure out and park find your way up to the sunlight and back to the hotel then when you are ready to check out the same dilemma again finding the car is a starter so apart from the complete windup from the relaxed stay parking was an issue
