i cannot believe that you have to pay an additional fee to use the pool this really infuriated me when our room was so pricey that they would charge extra just to use the chill area it was annoying because everything else was spot on and so i cannot say it s good value for money i wouldn t go again only for this reason there are plenty of spa hotels where the facilities are not an extra charge
