the wait at the spa was excessively long there weren t enough seats for everyone waiting having to sit in a short dressing gown in a crowded room with several men is not my idea of a relaxing way to wait for a spa treatment the wet area was also crowded and was much smaller than it looked in the photos apart from the wonderful massage the whole spa experience was very disappointing toiletries in room not replaced until i asked not enough breakfast tea bags supplied bed too hard no slippers provided in room
