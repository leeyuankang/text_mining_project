as soon as we got to the hotel to check in the guy behind the reception desk was on the phone to somebody saying things like do we have anything else available which made us panic also when checking out i had to hand over my card again for payment even though i did this already at check in i m assured that i will not be charged twice for the room and that the first payment will be refunded back but i really don t understand why they don t just accept the first payment instead of taking it again and cancelling the first one this makes absolutely no sense whatsoever and really worried now i will be charged twice for the room
