the fact that we didn t have any wi fi was very annoying and the film option wasn t available so i felt like i paid just for a nice bedroom and spa which i have just paid for the day then went home to my bedroom was which is just as nice i have been to your spa before i came in december with my boss which i gave to her as a gift and i was disappointed in the treatment the spa was lovely again but it was a lot hotter which i prefer the massage was an aromatherapy massage on paper and deep tissue in practise it was painful when aromatherapy is relaxing usually and no aromatherapy oils were used so i felt as if i had been robbed a bit but the overall experience was ok we had afternoon tea also which was lovely
