i didn t like the interior of the bathroom the shower was very hard to work to get the right temperature and pressure we ordered room service and the pizza was horrible and cost us in total which is a rip off i also think check out time at is too early i also think after paying for one night you should be able to use the pool area i was all set to go until i found out even hotel guests have to pay each to get into this area
