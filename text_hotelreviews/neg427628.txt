the view from our room wasn t that great so had to keep the curtains closed most the time the restaurant does not have a wide choice of food to choose from menus was very limited i love good food so was abit disappointing for such a nice hotel also annoyed about separate charge to use the spa as a hotel guest i believe this should be included as part of your stay
