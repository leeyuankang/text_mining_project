we only booked this hotel because of the famous spa but it was closed due to a faulty pool so we had travelled from midlands at expense on train for nothing as could not use the facilities and so had to leave early as checked in late after long journey so went out for dinner expecting to use the spa and pool the whole next day but our plans ruined due to maintenance problem with their pool not given refund or compensation only chose to stay at this hotel to use the k spa we also not allowed to use our k friends membership discounts or benefits as booked external rather than direct with hotel
