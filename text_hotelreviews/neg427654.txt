everything is an additional charge the reason people come to k west is for the spa so to be told that we had to pay extra to use the spa was ridiculous the spa facilities are nice however it is one room with the optional parts you can use nothing fancy at all will i stay here again no the final amount i paid i may as well have stayed in central london
