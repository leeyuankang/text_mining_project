i was absolutely appalled that after trawling the internet for a spa getaway for my boyfriend and i we were expected to pay extra to use the facilities upon arrival in our swim wear i am just very glad we went mid week and didn t have to pay the full per person for weekend use i ve never known a hotel to charge guests to use the facilities and not even at a discounted rate i was also incredibly suprised to be whacked with a bill for parking upon departure apparently this information was included in the booking but should be a whole lot clearer if i d known all of these extra costs were going to be thrown in i would ve booked a travel lodge as the hotel itself was not worth any more money
