my colleagues and i didn t particularly like being in the basement rooms the view out of my window was not good but the curtains were closed all the time as we weren t spending much time in the room this didn t really matter also there was a slight drainage smell which was dealt with by the staff and the plumbing was quite noisy when in use unfortunately we were unable to move rooms as the hotel was fully booked
