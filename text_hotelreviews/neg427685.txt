the location the room was not great i would have like to have gotten a better room in terms of view from the window the room was soo far from the lift to main reception the wifi did not work at all the sign was not recognised im sure that had something to do with where our room was situated the toilet flush handle was slightly broken so each toilet visit required two flushes the hot water in the shower was not really hot the shower was ridiculous the amount of water coming out was like niagra falls im sure the knob was broken i left a note when making my booking and explained to a staff member over the phone before coming the purpose of the trip and the fact that it was my fiances birthday so i expected a better room for what i paid for for one night also i do feel a bit cheated as i am a member of the k friends club i thought i would benefit from some of the discounts such as off breakfast included guanteed room upgrades however it states that these deals can only be used wen booking from the offical site when i tried to book from the site there were know avaliable dates for the date i required so i was forced to purchase off of another site after when i spoke to a member of staff and explained the situation she stated their are avaliable rooms so she doesnt no why it didnt let md book she said she was not able to honour any of the discounts as i had not booked through the site how frusrating
