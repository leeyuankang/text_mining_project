the price for breakfast was quite high in comparison the hilton would do breakfast for if you were staying with them and its a large variety of both cooked and continental so i feel an offer for people staying at least one night could be offered it s the only thing that lets down the hotel as it does feel pricey in comparison to other hotels of similar standard
