am a wheelchair guest the facility for disable in the room could be better since they don t have a roll in shower in the room i had the room on the ground floor level but i have to go down to level to use the public shower room roll in shower which is inconvenient for me however the staff are very helpful and give me a complimentary parking thru my stay
