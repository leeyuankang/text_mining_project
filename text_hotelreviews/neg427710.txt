the staff weren t great there were several issues with my stay overall the staff contacted me about the same issue several times the day before my party was due to arrive it was a simple mix up with my card details yet the staff left me a voicemail stating that they would cancel my booking if i didn t call back immediately as the booking was for a special occasion this was obviously upsetting one of our party s rooms was damp and smelt badly one of our party s rooms was double booked which caused significant delays to our evening activities one of our party s rooms had a shower which didn t work properly a staff member mistakenly entered one of our party s rooms at
