i came off the flight from new jersey and the room that had been booked for a few months was not ready the stwff then attempted to change rooms twice first time the room had another occupant second time the porter and i entered the next room and there was some mine sleeping in there then i was told that my room would not be available until pm i had flown overnight from new jersey and it was so had to find something else to do when i was exhausted they did offer for me to shower in the spa but i really wanted to sleep the room however was upgraded due to the problems that i experienced after that everything ran smoothly the stwff make the most effort to make you feel welcome the location is perfect as its so central
