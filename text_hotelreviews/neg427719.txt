my room close to the train line which made it noisy and i was unable to sleep i suffer from migraines due to the noise from the trains i was unable to sleep this was very stressful and unacceptable that i had to moved rooms three times i appreciate that these were made to help the situation however three times moving i did not get to enjoy my weekend break which should have been most of all a treat to recharge i have been working extremely hard for the last six months
