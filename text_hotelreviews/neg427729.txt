the small spa was good but over priced for customers staying the bar was too noisy and not welcoming coming back to at night the open plan library is also inappropriately situated next to the bar personally i would prefer a hard copy of hotel directory in the room not on line there was a fausty smell damp in our room which i should have mentioned to the staff
