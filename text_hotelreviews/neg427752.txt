the water in the bathroom was way to hot no cold water came out we had to pay extra just to use the swimming pool which is normally inclusive in other hotels which meant we were paying a lot of money just for the room our keys stopped working and it was a struggle just to contact reception overall i won t stay here again completely overrated
