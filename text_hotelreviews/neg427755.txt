our room was underground in a basement with no natual light and a concrete wall for a view the reception bar area turns into a hispter disco at night so don t think you ll get a quiet drink reception check in was slow and understaffed long queue we were double charged for breakfast while sorting it out we found out the breakfast is via booking com and at the hotel avoid price paid for room and expensive breakfast
