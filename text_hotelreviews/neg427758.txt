we got stuck in the lifts twice during our nights stay and that is unacceptable i ve reported to the reception but never heard back from them at all we had to use stairs after all because we were too scared to use the lifts for the second time the maintenance guy who rescued us was pretty rude unnecessarily i understand his job is not to provide a customer service but i don t think he d have to be rude to us i went to the gym at which was supposed to open at on weekdays and there was no lights on some people were already at the gym confused how to turn on the lights eventually a staff member turned up and turned on the lights but no apologies or anything staff didn t give us amenity nor towel change everyday maybe for environmental reasons but we needed them out of nights we didn t get enough towels and shampoos etc for of us staying together it was very inconvenient not to have enough toiletry stuff the room key stopped working on our second night whilst i understand there could be some technology error happening every now and again it was very frustrating coming back to the hotel after a long day walking all the way to our room our room was very far from the reception at went back to the reception and walked back again could it be avoided to happen wifi kept getting disconnected it may not be suitable to use for skype youtube etc lifts issues were a big turn off for me becashe even star hotels should have proper functioning lifts and it is a fundamental facility i would expect star hotels to have better maintenance in place
