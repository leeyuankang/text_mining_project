at the point of check in payment was taken from our debit card for the room and parking plus for incidentals which i don t think was deducted from our final bill upon check out receptionist quoted a figure which was due upon check out but i had to ask for a printed itemisation she said payment would be taken from the debit card but i did not have to sign anything to confirm the amount which would be taken or enter my pin very vague and confusing we also feel the service charge for each drinks order seems excessive reception staff member asked how many weeks pregnant i was i am not pregnant just carrying extra weight so a rather embarrasing and poor end to our stay
