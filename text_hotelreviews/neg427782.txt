they took money twice for my card they charged us on the same things twice room service calls we had to beg everyday for them to clean the room the hygiene is zero there we booked through booking com for week i had a health problem so had to extend for another weeks so i asked them for the same rate i had and we made a deal to upgrade with only extra at the checkout i was surprised that they put extra money per day on top of the upgrade overall the whole experience was horrible and if ur looking to book there u must double check the prices when you checkout bec they charge twice on some things
