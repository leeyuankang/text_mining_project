the hotel seems like it s very modern and new but the hotel is renewed and it s really old also it s so hidden and you should take care in the night when you go out and come back because it s in a hidden area the hotel its self is so busy this is because it has over hundreds of rooms and you can find only people in the reception for check in and check out therefore you need more than min to do that however the hotel lobby changed to a night club after pm and there s a dj mixer plays music which was so noisy to me especially when people got drunk and you ve children and you don t want them to see how they look like in addition i was given a room you need min walk to reach it i walk through corridors to get into my room finally for me i don t recommend this hotel at all and i won t come again
