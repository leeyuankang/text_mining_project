the bar staff were a let down for me they were always so concerned how you were paying a quick to put the bill down before you finish your drink and when ask for another drink they have so do another bill it happens a few times while you are trying to enjoy a drink the questions always start how are you paying the bill when your trying to have a conversation the reception staff were really good happy and helpful
