i walk in with a general feeling of meh but this may have to do with me comparing my last abode in paris to this hotel this did not have the same welcoming ambience or elegance but rather offered a rough and ready tumble with supposed music royalty i just found out this used to be the old bbc recording studios hence the layout seems utilitarian and caters more to a rock roll vibe my room was quite dated formica anyone had an old smell every time i open the door and the carpeting from the entrance to the corridors had a general look of grubbiness about it but could just be the retro shade glaring back at me at the time of my stay it looked nothing like the photos being advertised a bit hit and miss really
