was allegedly upgraded to an exec room which was in the basement dismal and had absorbed the soapy smell from the spa thankfully my room was changed staff seem very formal and lacking in a welcome take a tip from hotel staff in the usa they seem to be able to capture a very acceptable balance bar food and drinks seemed very expensive we stayed afterwards at the z hotel in old street and was offered a welcome complimentary glass of wine and cheese board now that is reminiscent of a san francisco hotel happy hour
