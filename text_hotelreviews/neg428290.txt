the internet was terrible if i had to rate the room with internet it would be below a because it was very important to me that they had working internet i asked the reception at night if he could fix it but he said they couldn t do anything about it and i mentioned it to the receptionist in the morning and she said they had no complaints i was the complaint everything else was great but if you need good wifi you won t get it here
