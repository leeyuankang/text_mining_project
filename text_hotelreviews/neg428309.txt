i booked expecting an apartment hotel but it is really just a series of unrelated rooms apartments in a building it has none of the usual facilities such as a foyer bar cafe etc and each time we needed to contact reception it was a different very young person each of whom was very pleasant and obliging but there was no possibility of consistency or follow up on our second day we reported that the shower was not draining properly and we ended each shower with water up to our ankles which then took about fifteen minutes to drain away but nothing was done the internet service was interrupted without notice apparently for maintenance and the unit didn t have a dvd player as advertised when we first moved in also the range of cooking utensils was fairly limited we had to be quite creative to get some meals cooked these aren t major problems and overall we did enjoy our stay
