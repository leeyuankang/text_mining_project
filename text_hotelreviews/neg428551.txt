for those visitors coming in a car the staff needs to provide much better instruction about parking there is actually a parking garage quite nearby which offers a very reasonable daily parking price if arranged through st shermin but unfortunately the details and location of the parking garage were only disclosed after we arrived which caused us a good deal of confusion at the outset of our visit so please next time be sure to explain the parking upfront as this will make the whole experience at st shermin get off to a much more comfortable start
