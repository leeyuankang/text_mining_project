reception is only open hours a day with the name being bed breakfast and champagne we expected at least a welcome glass on arrival but no it was apparently suppose to be offered with breakfast however we only saw it one day and it was not replenished for other guests who arrived later to breakfast you could always buy champagne but we expected a bit of luxury already included that wasn t there there are tea and coffee facilities in the lobby but you only have access to the coffee capsules put in your room by housekeeping unfortunately ours were never replenished so we could not have coffee
