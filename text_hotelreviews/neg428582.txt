not really bad but the reception person when she was there very limited hours always had her back turned to the front door we could have come in the front door and no one would really know if we were a guest or some crazy person robbing the place cause no one would turn around and say hello or even acknowledge us no effort to be welcoming which was disappointing nice hotel but it s sort of really self service to be fair we didn t sign up for breakfast maybe that s where the hotel people meet guests i don t know we like the personal touch in these smaller hotels and thought it would be a family run type of place but it wasn t very friendly at all bathrooms were small but that is minor a c didn t work too well the first day but was fine subsequently
