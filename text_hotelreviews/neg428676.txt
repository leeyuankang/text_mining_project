the hotel is very dark especially the corridors and the bedroom we couldn t see the keyhole to get the room key in and even with all the lights on the bedroom still felt like a cave albeit a very comfortable cave the speaker in the corridor ceiling right outside the bedroom door played music too loudly but a quick call to reception soon fixed things
