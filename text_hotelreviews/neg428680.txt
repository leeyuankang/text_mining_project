rooms were small for a deluxe king double we paid night and breakfast was not included hotel was very dark and a bit claustrophobic the interiors were absolutely beautiful but the dimmers neede to be turned up especially on the stairs no full length mirror in the bedrooms for a five star and the pool was just a paddle pool just for your feet so the pool description on your website was misleading staff were excellent and the service was impeccable we wouldn t book with booking com again as it was misleading the three nights cost and we only had drinks in the hotel i think breakfast should definitely have been included
