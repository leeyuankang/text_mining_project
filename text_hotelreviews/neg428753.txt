the room s pictures on booking com look so nice but in reality it is old rooms and old furniture of the rooms we booked on line and very old carpet etc and ac wasn t working well but when we complained the staff were so kind and upgraded our room to much better and new refurbished styled room which is real good stars hotel room but again the staff really so great and they deserve all compliments
