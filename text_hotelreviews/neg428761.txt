i ve booked executive suit with city view but received very tiny and very old room under the roof with no view at all we were just unable to reach those small windows at first staff tried to persuade me that it is an executive suite and that they don t have any other rooms available once i almost started screaming they found another old room on a lower floor at least with windows we ve checked spa area and it is not appealing as well breakfast is very busy to many people i would not recommend anyone this hotel this is the worst star hotel i ve ever seen and it doesn t worth the money you have to pay for it
