the hotel misrepresented two things booking com said that there was a airport shuttle but when we arrived at the airport the hotel said that they would not provide a shuttle i had to pay a significant amount to hire a taxi i exchanged correspondence with the hotel afterwards about this situation and they said they were not interested in addressing the situation when we checked in the hotel offered us a discount for the typical breakfast charge which i gratefully accepted when i returned home the hotel sent me a letter rescinding the discount and billed my credit card without permission for the amount of the discount i am considering contesting the charge on my credit card i selected le meridian for a combination of location and cost if they are so desperate for income then they should increase their room rates needless to say i am not impressed with the hotel especially since they declined to address my concerns after the fact
