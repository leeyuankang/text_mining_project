air conditioning in my room had not been adjusted for winter so the thermostat made no difference when set to hot so was freezing my first night however they swiftly dealt with the heating when i did ask room service cleaning staff did not replace a dirty cup i left from soup i had in it appeared to be just cleaned in the sink and wiped dry as traces of my soup were still in the cup so i wonder if the drinking glasses are replaced either
