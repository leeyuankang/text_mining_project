the room internet connection terrible we arrived late at night no one helped us bring our bags into the hotel room staff checked us on the second floor felt like we were going down a rabbit hole in alice in the wonderland door after door corridor after another turn left after another then up a flight of stairs still no lift in sight couldnt believe my eyes when we finally got to the room felt like the house help in downtown abby up the loft and exiled would really rank the hotel stars dont get me started about the room service and quality of the food dont even think about ordering the food was worse than the airplane meals
