the interior design is a tragedy new lobby looks really dull and cheap like a cheap star hotel in developing country the old rooms are not only old fashioned style but also ridiculously designed shower with no handle washbasin tap so high that a year old cant reach it it needs a serious refurbishment overall experience is definitely not reflecting an european star quality
