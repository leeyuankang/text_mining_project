the room was on its way to being run down the cream leather chaise longue was grubby the expensive shower had mouldy tiles which was a shame for a night you expect better bathroom was big but poorly ventilated the windows onto the courtyard hadn t been cleaned in a year and were dusty with cobwebs please note that the swimming pool is uncomfortably cool for kids and not suitable for paddling with children
