hotel restaurant was under construction which we didn t know at the time of the booking alternative breakfast was served in a conference room that was decorated as temporary breakfast room luckily we didn t book a room including breakfast so we had breakfast in a nearby cafe aida where you get excellent breakfast for less than euros
