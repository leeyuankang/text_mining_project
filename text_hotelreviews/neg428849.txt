booking was incorrect we had requested twin beds and the room we had reserved classic overlooking the courtyard had room only for one very small double bed this classic room was very small so as we read on revues that these are big rooms perhaps this was the only small one we had to have a lengthy row to get another room for which originally there was to be a euro a night extra charge this came down to euros a night and finally we paid only the original agreed price the room we were allocated overlooking the side road was very large but sparsely furnished with detached mobile furniture the cupboard was attached to the staged safe coffee refrigerator units so when the cupboard door was open then one could not get at any of the other three the door of the room did not lock from the inside the bolt was misaligned so we had to shift a heavy metal coat rack in front of it each night the night we were going to a concert the room had not been done by when we returned to the hotel for a rest so we straightened it ourselves the next day when we went out we asked if the room could be done by it would seem that the maid took this to heart as on the next our final morning she rang our door bell at the tv was set to arabic and although we could get some programmes in english others were dubbed in arabic eg we saw mp kenneth clarke in the house of commons speaking in arabic all the service details were in arabic so because there was no hotel service book in the room we had to ask at reception the times of breakfast etc when we go to vienna again it will be unlikely that we stay again in this hotel
