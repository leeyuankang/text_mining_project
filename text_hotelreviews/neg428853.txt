the receptionist lady was absolutely not helpful gave wrong information regarding the car parking possibility and we get a fine the check in was incredibly complicated i didn t understand why we had to pay warranty room for the minibar in advance but surely we paid it i get an unofficial invoice which doesn t contained any details about the rooms and the nights and it was addressed only with my name without my address all my data were given via booking com i visit hotels per a year because of my business trips all over the world although this time it was a holiday with my american friends but i have never had such a bad experience regarding administration before
