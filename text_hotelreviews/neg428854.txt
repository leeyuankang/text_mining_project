staff responded very slow i was assigned to a twin bed room which i requested to be moved to king bed room i was asked to wait in the room i waited for minutes and in the end i went to the concierge to my surprise the staff indeed has done nothing to my request and only made effort to change my room after i approached the concierge one could imagine how long i would wait if i stayed patiently in the rol facilites are okay not really a star hotel in my opinion
