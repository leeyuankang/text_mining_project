the front office was understaffed on our check in at pm we had to wait for minutes with only a few people in front of us we were given the wrong room which also had to be sorted out we were missing a few items from the room for which we had to relay multiple messages to fix so the communication can be improved given above we did not have a star feeling and felt that the accommodation was overpriced
