the room service food is really terrible for a hotel chain such as meridien each time we ordered room service the proper change was not given back to us consider there is also a good service charge attached to it at checkout we were given a nice bill for phone calls which we did not make we were connected through the hotel to another local shop but they could at least inform us before connecting that the call will be charged an insane rate my data plan in the entire month costs less than that we did not end up paying this but when you are hungry in the morning and the first thing you have to do is check out this is not a pleasant way to start the day the shampoos and shower gels are not replaced either they way you would expect
