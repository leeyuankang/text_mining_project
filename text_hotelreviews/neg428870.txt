on the negative the bars restaurants nor the lounges areas are not places where you want to stick around they have no atmosphere and they re not cosy plus it is allowed to smoke in the champagne bar also the restaurant staff charged me by mistake for a single glass of wine luckily i spotted it i was also attending the day conference downstairs and my partner company paid for the cocktail reception at the end of the evening i asked a waiter for an extra glass of wine which he was just taking away and he refused to give it to me saying that the time is the time i found his attitude rude also one of the participants had her laptop stolen during the conference clearly some security issues there
