at my room was not ready i booked a studio however i was given a rooftop room very different than the one i booked and the windows were without a curtain i called them asking if this the studio i booked they called me again and said they are nearly the same and you can see the other room if you like to change i saw the studio it was really different with two bathrooms and a dinner table the size was and the other one was only i got really angry and wondering why they did this another thing about this hotel is the flooring carpets and chairs are worn and torn for a star hotel when you get in the loby you will notice an old worn and torn sofa which will give a miserable feeling
