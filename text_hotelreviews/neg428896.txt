we are experienced travellers and have done extensive travelling around europe on many occasions in our opinion le meridien vienna is not a star hotel by any stretch of the imagination it is far from it we all know vienna is relatively expensive but this hotel is a rip off at anything more than euros a night we paid double that regardless of the season the location is good and if you book an executive room the rooms are large however that is about it the furniture in the rooms is below what you would expect from ikea and the termination decor is of poor standard furthermore the rooms are not it is properly cleaned and the toiletries which you take for granted in far cheaper hotels are supplied are almost non existent the corridors are grotty with dirty carpets and stained walls the lobby area is extremely basic and far below what the price of this hotel or the photos may lead you to believe there is very limited and at times no staff at all in the the absence reception lobby area and we noted with concern that anybody could walk in and out and access any floor without being a guest at the hotel so notable that it makes for a very poor reception some staff inform us that apparently this hotel is in the management is cutting down on cost and had reduced staff and this is patently obvious to those unfortunate enough to have fallen for the deceiving photos issued by the hotel also we can only assume that any favourable ratings and comments originate from naive travellers whose point of comparison is youth hostel type accommodation or from dummy fake sources if this hotel does not get sold which is apparently being negotiated it should close this hotel as currently advertised and priced must rank as the number one accommodation scam in vienna for the same money you can do much much better in nearby true four and five stars properties do yourself a favour avoid this hotel
