unfortunately the services are very bad i had to go directly to the reception because i couldn t find the number form the reception in the room i didn t have enough shampoo shower gel no shower cap no sticks basically very dissapointed because it costs a lot of money per night and accordingly to stars hotel expectations now i rate the hotel very very low comparing with years back the cleaning ladies are very rude and they were speaking romanian and i m romanian too and understood everything from what they were saying i stayed at floor and when i asked in english please could you bring me some shower gel they were talking between them in romanian what the f ck do she want more so i have to say that would be indicated not to hire anymore these kind of people with this attitude and language or at least to invest more training in them i m not sure if i want to visit again your hotel regards
