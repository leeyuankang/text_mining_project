i ve had much better experiences in hostels i paid for a suite for my partners christmas present and our stay was an absolute disaster the hotel froze over in my bank account when i d already paid for the hotel half of the money was without getting my authorisation they needed a guarentee for the room and said i d receive the money back in days days later i went back to the reception and asked when i d receive the money back and they said weeks given that it was on christmas eve a time when most of us are a little short of cash to agree to a pre authorisation amount of was a frozen another without authorisation was pretty outrageous the hotel needed to take the second figure in order to refund a card i d previously paid on this also led to me being charged foreign transaction fees by the bank we spent hours sat in the hotel on the final day with the hotel offering no compensation for the fact that i d be charged transaction fees or had to wait over a week and a half longer for to be returned to my account they wouldn t even offer us a taxi to the station even though they had made us wait the hotel staff even said that the procedures were insufficient and to credit the reception they were clearly unable to do anything due to a front of house manager with little customer facing skills we are not people who require everything to be perfect and often stay in much cheaper accommodation but having money frozen in my bank account without authorisation and having to pay extra for a hotel due to their negligence ruined our holiday this will definitely happen again so i strongly advise everyone to avoid this hotel
