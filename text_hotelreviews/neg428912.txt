the atmosphere of the breakfast area was very uninviting given the fact that it is used as a bar restaurant in the evening the unlimited minibar offer is a joke not that it was our motivation to stay here but the unlimited minibar consisted bottle of water a coke a diet coke a fruit juice and a beer this is all ridiculous only because they used this as an extra value promotion it has everything but still no good feel of the hotel
