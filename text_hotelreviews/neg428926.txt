one day during our stay there was a big business event at the hotel so as guest and a paying customers we re now not allowed too visit the hotel bar anymore after we complained and said this is not acceptable we re allowed too visit the bar again when i booked the hotel i requested single beds but when i arrived they had not arranged this but the nice evening staff fixed that problem rather fast
