i felt like the room was equipped and styled like a comfort inn or a holiday inn it was sparsely furnished with minimalistic styled furniture it was modern and not very comfortable it was our most expensive room out of our hotel day trip and had the worst lobby and facilities we paid night for nights if i had booked earlier in the month i would have gotten a room at another classic star traditional hotel for night but this was last minute and the only star hotel that was available it was convenient to the opera and on the inner ring but there were many other hotels in that area that would have been better suited for us
