read my other reviews which many people have i always look for the positive and give the benefit of the doubt however i must warn you not to book this hotel we booked this hotel for our wedding anniversary and stayed on april to april arrived at registered and booked in luggage came back at as agreed to be told there was a mistake with our room we had been allocated when we registered in the morning at we were shown to our room we found out that there was a housekeeping issue no one told us or kept us up to date or offered any refreshment while we waited we went to the terrace and a had a drink nice staff great drinks we booked in the restaurant for and were told that we would be given a free drink for our room cleaning problem arrived in restaurant at nice waiter engaged us in conversation only to be removed from our table physically removed by a man in a white suit and bow tie who then allocated someone else to take our order minutes later after asking on a number of occasions our drinks had still not arrived and there was no sign of any food not even bread for the table at we complained and left we still had not had a drink and there was still no food the following evening we sat outside ordered a drink and again waited for minutes decided to not eat in the restaurant but ordered room service instead which was ok the room was tired with the shower door off its hinges and more importantly the electics where dangerous two bathroom lights on the mirror did not work and on closer inspection had burnt out and where loos in the fitting all lamps in the room where unplugged and when we plugged them in plugs ejected across the room with sparks flying we paid in total just over euros for two nights with food and drinks i feel completely ripped off i am so angry that i paid them money and they couldn t offer me a basic service and a bit of civility
