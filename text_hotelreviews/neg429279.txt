the rooms were incredibly hot we asked to have our a c fixed and the response was initially to open a window then they moved our room but it was still hot the rooms look nice but are a little run down in person the staff is nice but are clearly mostly students they could not answer some basic questions though that may be a language issue so we can t blame them for that we were asked to check out two days early because they had something wrong in their system but then did not apologize when i brought the error to their attention the food in the hotel is also over priced
