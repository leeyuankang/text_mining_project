the staff could be a little more hip and trendy they didn t explain anything about the hotel or facilities but rather just checked me in and gave me a key the hotel should have a gym also since it s an old college they could have some trendy libraries or chill out areas also the lobby bathrooms use rituals products but they don t use the same great product in the rooms for that price and luxury i would expect more it looks like it was going for a cool trendy upscale hipster hotel but missed it it was a little too snooty than cool also the wifi was horrible
