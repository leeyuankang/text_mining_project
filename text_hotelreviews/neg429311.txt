this hotel is not at the cheaper end but when asked to have a later check out for a few hours they would only do so with an addtional charge which is really poor service compared to other hotels we have stayed in which are on the same level the rooms are dark and really lack natural light and we could do no more than the nights as it s too oppressive with very poor light in the bathroom and minimal natural light in the main bedroom
