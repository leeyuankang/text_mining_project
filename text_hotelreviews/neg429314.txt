first night we had a free upgrade in a suite and the mini bar for free problem room has no windows to open and the air conditioner did t work well two fans brought by the reception did t help a lot so was it really an upgrade but second night was wonderful i t a great place on sunny days don t choose a room under the roof just to be sure
