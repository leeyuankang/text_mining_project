we stayed in the hotel for nights and had a junior suite at the terrace side upon a late arrival in the evening we were left in a room which was clearly not a junior suite and where the airconditioning was clearly not working after having switched the room to a category which we had booked the extra bed fr our son i had ordered in advance was not present on the positive side the a c was working here however we heard much noice a studentparty was booked for the evening of our arrival the noice of the music and people talking loud outside on the terrace was unbearable until the party was over at in the night the windows have no isolation single glass and as such all noise was clearly to be heard in the room it was also necessary to chase away a couple from the second floor who were looking for some privacy just outside the door of our room and who were clearly not hotelguests the beds were not properly sheeted which the housekeeping corrected the following day the wastebin in the bathroom was not cleared from the previous guest and the room was not cleaned during one day of our stay despite the sign please service the room once the issues were addressed the staff worked well to correct this and offered a discount of for the first night and free stay for our son nevertheless even if the philosophy of the hotel is to train promising students for the work in hotels the processes and guidance by trained staff must be improved
