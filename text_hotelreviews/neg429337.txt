the college hotel is a brand that has a teaching element within it s staffing structure they have a lot of young professionals who are learning the job within the hotel supported by professionals who are more experienced this is fine as a concept but i felt the balance of untrained to trained staff wasn t good enough it felt like the place as being run all by the untrained staff at some times with no visible experienced staff around the untrained staff weren t awful by any stretch of the imagination they were generally really good however i felt that compared to the setting within the hotel and the general excellent quality of the rooms etc the service didn t meet the same standard it felt frustrating at times the breakfast was good however you have to order anything that you want hot eggs bacon etc i didn t like this set up because i often found myself waiting for the food to be delivered when i was pushed for time and often it wasn t super quick twice i had to leave before the food turned up because i was pushed for time
