we asked for a cot for our baby but the cot we received had a hole in the side we found the cot pushed up against the side of an arm chair in order to cover the hole the mattress was not firm enough for a baby and very uneven the baby s head sunk into the mattress leaving her legs higher then her head being the heaviest part of her body the sheets were coming undone sheets and mattress need to be firm for a baby or this can be potentially very dangerous besides that the hotel was nice
