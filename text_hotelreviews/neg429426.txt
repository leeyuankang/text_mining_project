very weak wifi signal almost no internet was accessible however thanks to the neighbouring hotel which has very good wifi coverage with free access it really saved us bathroom was not very well ventilated so when jet bathtub was activated it was very hot in the room there is a small window in the niche of the bathtub but opening of the window is restricted a bit far off the city center about min of walking too expensive
