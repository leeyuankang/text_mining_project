the air in broke in my room and blasted degree heat into the room during the night i woke up parched and feeling ill no windows in the room so i had to sleep with the door open didn t feel safe the guy that came to look at the dodgy air conditioning that night couldnt believe the heat coming out of it he said that he would arrange arrange a new room for the next morning but it couldn t be done until we waited in the hotel until only to find that the staffa hasn t been notified and there was no room which wasted a while morning in amsterdam for us we did eventually get a room but there was no wifi then in order to use the wifi i had to go out into the middle of the street to use the wifi for the other building eventually sitting on a cold doorstep in the middle of the night to check into my flight i was exhausted in the end because of the terrible nights sleep i got the night before i asked for a discount even for the night where i hardly got a wink of sleep but the hotel refused all i got was two bottles of water to make up for how dehydrated i got on the night the air conditioning broke
