our basement junior suite was directly below the restaurant and the noise of tables and chairs being moved in preparation for breakfast started before so if you are a light sleeper this could be very annoying you can also hear every footstep of people moving around above the room for a suite the d cor furnishings and fittings were less than luxurious and the general feel was of a slightly dingy basement room the room was also missing the dining table and chairs and one of the armchairs shown in the website photos
