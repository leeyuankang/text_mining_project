the cleaning of the room took place between and we came back to our room after a long day exploring and at the room still hadn t been cleaned bit of a pain when we wanted to have a little rest before going back out in the evening the receptionist explained that they had until to clean the room and if we didn t want to be interrupted by the cleaner then we should put the do not disturb sign on the door and the room would not be cleaned that day also no instructions on how to use the coffee machine i didn t ask the receptionist i m sure if i did they would have told me you must state the time of arrival when booking the hotel we got to the hotel around our stated arrival time and our room wasnt ready this was fine as we knew we couldn t check in until we came back to the hotel around and we still had to wait for our room they told us our room was ready the receptionist said they d given us an upgrade to one of our ground floor rooms when i asked if this was a basement room the receptionist said it was but it had a bath and it was a lovely room etc i said i didn t want that room as i read some reviews on trip advisor that the room wasn t great i explained i specifically booked a room in the annex because the rooms were supposed to be nicer they moved us to be fair to the receptionist this was done without hesitation so we finally got into our room about o clock it was a long first day i will definitely return to amsterdam but sadly i d try a different hotel
