specifically chose this hotel and room as i was desperate for a bath after months of crappy hostel bathrooms and was incredibly disappointed when i tried to have a bath at to be told the plug in that room was broken and bath couldn t be used received a refund for the difference from a non bath room but still annoying as i spent more money on this hotel compared to other hotels without bath options for that reason staff were good to deal with but i still didn t get the bath i was really looking forward to internet was also bad on the third floor
