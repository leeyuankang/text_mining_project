the room was tiny like star hotels might have most of the space was taken by the bed the bathroom room didn t stay open and did not close either as well as it was all bloated from the water more the ventilation system did not take all steam from the room so it was annoying the wardrobe was only enough for one person for days not a week definitely i went downstairs and asked for a better hairdryer and did not receive any response later from the reception as i didn t ask for anything we also requested a late checkout and it was approved online and upon the check in however at we got knock knock from the room service and was told to check out because it was reception apologised for that but it was quite annoying as we were still in bed after a late b day night out overall i saw more thoughtful and attentive staff for less money paid so it was disappointing
