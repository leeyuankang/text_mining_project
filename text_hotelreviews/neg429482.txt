the receptionist tried to give us a smaller and noisier room than the one i had reserved then asked me to return later and she would give us a room on an upper floor but when i returned hours later she offered a room on the ground floor the hotel is rated with stars but the room is cleaned only in the morning the towels were not changed the carpet was quite dirty
