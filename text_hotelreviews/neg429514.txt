the location was in a good spot mins from leidsplein where i like to stay only thing was due to the built up area the wasn t really a view that i can judge there was just looking into other people s windows but i m happy it had a balcony regardless if you like views this wouldn t be a ideal hotel i didn t order food so i can t judge the mini fridge was full of options though
