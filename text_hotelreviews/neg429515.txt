i did not like the way hotel roemer took it upon them selves to over charge me by euro and then think that it is ok for the money to be returned over a week later they have stolen money from me without my convent they have also taken money from my account for things from the mini bar that we did not take we were completely honest with everything and paid the euro for the mini bar when we left this is a shame as we visit amsterdam often and thought we had finally found a hotel that we were happy with however after this i will not be booking with hotel roemer or booking com again and i will be warning potential customers of this on trip advisor and twitter
