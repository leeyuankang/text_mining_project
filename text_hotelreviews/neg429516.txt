nothing the hotel could do about it but we had extremely noisy neighbours in the adjacent room for nights this was in the main hotel building and sound travels through the walls also have to mention that although the room was clean many details had been missed by the cleaning staff we had a balcony where the previous occupants had left their empty lunch boxes on the table cleared on the following day the mini bar had not been restocked and there was a partly eaten chocolate bar in it this was sorted as soon as i reported it on our third day we had no towels when we returned in the evening again sorted immediately
