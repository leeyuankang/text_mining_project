we asked to change rooms because we were in the basement and had requested on our reservation that we not be placed there we were moved next day to a room where the air conditioning was not working during the rest of our our stay they were unable to fix the air conditioner fortunately the weather cooled the next day and we did nt need it the manager offered us an upgrade on our next visit to the hotel felt the staff we interacted with were sympathic to our situation
