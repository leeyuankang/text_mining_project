the double room size is quite small no drawers no hanger for jackets in the hallway the bathroom is not fully closed there are doors for the small room with the toilet no toilet brush no ventilation no window there are no door for a bath tub which is quite inconvenient to enter not recommended to elderly people this lack of privacy is maybe ok for couples but not sure if it would be for others
