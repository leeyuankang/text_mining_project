there was no hood in the toilet but even a toilet freshener and a toilet brush either it was disturbing that the bathroom was in the room and the door was completely transparent glass there was no cover on its surface although we hang out the do not disturb sign the air condition cleaning staff knocked on the door the last day before we left they didn t replace the run out paper tissues and didn t put up toilet paper either unfortunately the daily cleaning didn t include mopping the floor although it was spotty and a small thing it would be nice if the hotel can obtain a balance to measure the luggages to avoid repacking them at the airport due to the weight limit
