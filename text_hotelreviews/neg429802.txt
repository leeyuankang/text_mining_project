it was weird that there was a glass panel between the shower and the room because the neighbors could see everything what you are doing when the curtains are open but also as two friends it is weird to see each other naked maybe it s possible to place a foil on the glass but if i went with my partner i wouldn t mind so it s not really a bad thing just something to think about
