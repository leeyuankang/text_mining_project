reception staff were not very welcoming i asked about the ironing service as advertised and they said there wasn t one but i could go to the dry cleaners round the corner when we got to the room there was an iron and ironing board also when we left the receptionist just asked us for the money we owed for items we had from the mini bar and said nothing else not even goodbye
