didn t like that when i booked the accommodation i asked for special requests and didn t get them atall even tho it was my engagement and boyfriends birthday the room had the worst view and to top it off there was no shower in the room so we had to wait half n hour for that to arrive and that took time off are day and we didn t have long here atall as we came to check out we asked if we could extend are room or even have somewere to shower etc all that was available was he swimming pool i didn t find this place very helpful as they didn t even try and help i m gutterd as i enjoyed the actual hotel but it will take a lot for me to want to stay again as i love barcelona
