not only was the hotel room dirty with a bathroom that clearly hadn t been cleaned the staff was the biggest disappointment the staff was disrespectful and impolite talked to us in the least pleasing way possible in this hotel long gone is the time where you speak with clients in a nice and respectful way everything is done with violence i don t know if i am allowed to name employees but my complaint wouldn t be complete without this jordi a special thanks to you for being the worst reception staff member i have met in my life for treating me and my brother in the worst way possible during check out the hotel would be a better place without you working there and this remains a euphimism it is clear that we will never set foot again in this hotel and neither should you
