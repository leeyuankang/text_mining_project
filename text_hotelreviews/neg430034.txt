this is a big and noisy hotel marbel flooring in all the hallways so the sound of high heels suitcases and housekeeping would carry really well especially at night my room was faced away from the street but not to a backyard it was faced around the elevators which were pretty noisy when in use which was pretty much all the time when i opened the window my room would smell of sigarettes the hotel has a smoking area om the bottom floor not very ideal for us who like fresh air no heating in the bathroom floor this is a good and modern hotel but i found it to hard to relax there will not revisit
