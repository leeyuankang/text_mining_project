the beds were hard and slid on the floor when sitting up at night the front desk staff were pleasant but not very knowledgable about local activities amenities etc the breakfast buffet was mediocre in quality and choice apart from nice bread when the room was cleaned a used tea cup was washed in the bathroom sink and left to dry there very average and not a four star experience i would not recommend to a friend apart from location and would advise against paying for the breakfast option
