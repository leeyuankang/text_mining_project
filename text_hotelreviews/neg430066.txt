some staff were very friendly and helpful and others were not the staff were quite variable it would be nice to have a warmer welcome in the breakfast room a smile would be nice and for staff not to argue with guests but rather discreetly check things out before responding it seemed as if some staff were doing a favor for guests rather than being paid to provide a service the room cleaning was variable it seemed to decline the longer i stayed even though i was paying the same daily rate start as you plan to continue so there is no change in the service provided
