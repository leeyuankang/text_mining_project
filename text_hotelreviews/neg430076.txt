the rooms are small the bathroom was so small you have to sit on the toilet sideways the service from staff is very slow great if you are with friends and want to chat not so good if have had a big day of walking and just want some dinne shower bed breakfast on the first day was outstanding however the next few days this was not repeated my advice go early because once the tray is empty it is not refilled
