the room was really a corner and rather small moreover it was a bit dark as it has only a small window the furniture felt old the sound proofing is really bad we heard people coming late at night and room service cleaning up early in the morning it was very loud and and we could not sleep for almost night for the double room it felt overpriced the check in was way too long it took more than min to check in and there was not even a line two reasons the receptionist was waiting for the other two to finish another check in that was taking forever as well to ask a question before starting my own check in their computer system was very slow
