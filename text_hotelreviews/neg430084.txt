the staff was extremely rude and indifferent for several requests i have paid the usual fair yet they gave me a handicap person room where the bathroom light was keep on flashing like a discoball and the bath drain wasn t working when i asked for a change i had to fight all the way through it until i have got another room requesting a late check out felt as if i am asking for free car to the airport the hotel would do way much better if they manage to teach the staff to be more friendly more happy and more welcoming
