we travelled for friend s hen do and all the party members arrived at different time couple of our friends arrived on saturday around when the check it starts and where told that the room they booked is not yet ready as the guest who is currently staying in it is refusing to leave didn t show up for check out they were told the issue will be solved an hour and they were offered free drinks vouchers and temporary room so they could leave their luggage and change then we all spent the rest of the afternoon on the beach returning to the hotel around it turned out their room was still not vacated by the previous guest and the hotel staff told them without any sign of apology that they will have to stay in their temporary room as there is nothing they could do until the other guest shows up for check out the room my friends booked was an upgraded room and they were placed in a standard the hotel staff s attitude was this is what it is deal with it rather than apologising and trying to make things better after an argument that started the male receptionist decided to finally call the hotel manager for advice and after spending min on the phone came out of the office and decided to talk to a different customer completely ignoring us when we were finally attended again we were told once again there is nothing they can do about the other guest and that my friends will have to stay in the temporary room however they will refund the difference for the night and move them to the correct room the next day they were also offered free dinner at the hotel restaurant but we came as a group and had our reservations made at different restaurants no other compensation was offered the next day our friends decided to use their free drink vouchers at the bar
