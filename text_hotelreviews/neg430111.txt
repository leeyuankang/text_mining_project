the customer service was abysmal i travel regularly and i have never been treated the way i was at this hotel i booked a room with a terrace which was not available when i checked in hours after check in opened because they could not get in contact with the previous guest to ask him to leave hours later after spending the day at the beach my room was still not ready as they still couldn t get in touch with him no apology no proper explanation since clearly they have a key and can remove the trespasser so we stayed in a non terrace room our whole trip anyway they gave us welcome drink vouchers when we checked in so we decided to use them the following night before dinner we asked the barman what we were allowed to have and he said anything so we ordered amaretto and gin and tonic as i lifted them from the bar to take them to my table another barman appeared and said the first one made a mistake and we had to pay for the drinks since they were not part of the welcome voucher options obviously i replied to say since the mistake is yours and you cannot pour the drinks bank into the bottle surely you can t make us pay for it he insisted i refused to pay so he poured the drink down the sink i have never experienced such a petty response from someone in customer service the bar man was called rajib and he was awful who does that at check out we asked to speak to the manager which we had done every day he apologised for the above and offered to give us anything we had taken from the mini bar off our bill but we hadn t taken anything from the mini bar no other offer of a discount was made instead the worst customer service i have ever experienced and when we were checking out we could overhear other guests complaining too i have never posted anything before but i m doing this to help people please do not stay here barcelona is beautiful and this hotel ruins it
