the room was very small for people adult teenagers all twin beds the window faced a very small interior courtyard so you couldn t open the curtains unless you wanted people in the glass elevator or other rooms to see directly into your room would not recommend for guests hotel buffet breakfast was expensive so try to get it included in your overnight rate or go to one of the great pastry coffee shops nearby
