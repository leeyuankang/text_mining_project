the rooms were tiny we booked two adjacent rooms as we have two children but the rooms were not connected and very small the room was poorly appointed and the bed was worst with broken springs and uneven feel we booked the hotel for nights but checked out just after first night the hotel staff was trying to be helpful but the language was a big barrier and even getting simple items like coffe mugs was a challenge and we were provided paper cup from the coffee machine
