during our stay the air conditioning wasn t working properly although the staff were very understanding and obviously trying to rectify the problem the pictures on the website were a little misleading in regards to the size of the pool just a plunge pool really and the rooms i d expected a balcony or at least a view but we got rooms facing the interior with a view of the lifts
