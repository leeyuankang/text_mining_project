we had an issue with booking the room and the hotel wouldn t let it slide which i thought was poor customer service to start with then the receptionist offered us complimentary drink vouchers and told us to get a beer when we went to the bar they told us only wine or water was available with the voucher which was a disappointment the room was spacious but offered very little light and there was also a tile hanging loose off the wall in the bathroom behind the shower then the rooftop pool was nice but on the first day we went up to find no staff to serve at the bar the staff were also unprepared to give change and there was a shortage of loungers at the pool as well all in all the friendly staff and location were not enough to entice me back to this hotel and i won t stay here again
