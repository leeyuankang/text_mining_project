i called the reception to make a wake up call they didn t wake us up i asked for a bottle of water feom the room service they said they closed the cash machine so i had to go down to their bar to get the water in my pyjamas we asked the reception to book a big taxi van for us because we have many luggages and of course they said yes but they actually didn t i never write a review before but in this case i have to as i never experienced a horrible low grade service such as this hotel beforw the hotel is rated stars only because of the location but the rest i would give star only the room is dirty bathroom is also old and dirty air conditioning is ild and has noise it was truely a horrible experienced to all of us i will never recommend this hotel to anyone its not worth the price
