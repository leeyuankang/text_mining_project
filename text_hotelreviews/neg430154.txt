i have written to the hotel about them charging me twice for one stay once a day before my arrival and that to about hours earlier than my cancellation time and the second time they charged me at the time of checking in and i reported the same to the checkin manager he said it was not reflecting in his system but if it is so it would be refunded still waiting for the same also we have written back to them on the same issue about a week back with the credit card companies charge alert but still there is no revert or confirmation about the refund expect booking com to solve this case since the credit card information was taken with the assurance of no charge and then this happening was a surprise
