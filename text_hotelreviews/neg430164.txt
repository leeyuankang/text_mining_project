below standard hotel and airco not working because it s still winter according the hotelmanagement very disappointing room had temperatures around degrees and sleeping was everything except comfortable you could open the window but we are in de centre of barcelona so a lot of traffic noise day and night in my opinion if you have stars a good climate control must be working otherwise we can also go to an hostel or something although the rooms have enough equipment the look and feel is a bit depressive by the use of dark and old wooden plates against the wall give it a fresh color and it would be much better it s a shame that negative things made us decide to never go back to this place we stay in many hotels and this hotel has a good opportunity to become a good hotel but they need to improve on the climate control
