although the room was elegant and very well appointed it was too small for three people i requested an upgrade and it was not available the front desk was kind enough to send bottled water and chocolates we really would have preferred a larger room i soon realized that i could have booked a larger room in a different hotel and in the same neighborhood for the same amount of money i will seek a larger room in the future as i mostly travel with my husband and family the room was actually too small for two it seems to be a perfect fit for a business person traveling alone
