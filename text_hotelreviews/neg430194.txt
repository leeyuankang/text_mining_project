they tried to give us a smoking room what smelled very badly despite i asked for a non smoking already during booking at first they said it is not possible to change the room because the hotel is full at the end they were willing to replace the room to a non smoking one we booked the hotel mainly because of the rooftop terrace we planned to have a dinner or a drink there maybe it is our fault and it is described somewhere on the hotel s site it turned out that the roof terrace is just for a pool and closed after we arrived for one night so we did not even have a chance to go up there
