on the last day we could not keep the room we had a late flight and there was no where to shower in the hotel we asked for a alternative room and we were told that the hotel was full yet there was still availability on booking com website there is only one public loo in the lobby a long way from the floor pool when you have no room facilities this spoilt our view of an otherwise good hotel
