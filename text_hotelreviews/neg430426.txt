the bed is uncomfortable bed sheets are like hard paper and the ac is just over your head it isnt a star hotel maybe a the pool area is tiny and there is no option to just relax on the roof you are either sitting at the bar or dip in the pool there is no lounge area staff is very fake friendly i love barcelona but there are much better hotels than this one not recommended and overpriced
