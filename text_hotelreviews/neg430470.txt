the reason i rated this so low especially on comfort is because i was given a room with a door that joined directly to another room this door looked like a cupboard so when i opened it and saw it was backing onto the other room through a door in the wall i was pretty shocked then all i heard all night was tourists next door talking really loud it was as if they were in my room because i was shattered and it was gone i did not have the strength to call down to reception and complain the next morning whilst checking out i was not asked about my stay either i guess the staff know this room is like this this is shocking considering it is a hotel and i paid a high price and even selected quiet room and wrote this as an additional request the next day i felt awful from sleeping so late not how you should feel after sleeping at a hotel again really shocked a hotel could do this and it completely put me off ever recommending this hotel why would i recommend a hotel that could have a door like this in every room no sleep and relaxation
