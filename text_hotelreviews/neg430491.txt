security could have been better my daughter s bag was taken from the sofa where i was sitting by two professional thiefs working together in the lobby where guests were relaxing this was a real disappointment as we were super aware of pickpockets when out and about but were relaxed in the hotel big mistake never leave your possessions down anywhere the police station was full of crying tourists who had been robbed of money passports etc the hotel have provided us with a voucher for a future stay and we re very sorry for what happened
