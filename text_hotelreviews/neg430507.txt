a few minor pieces of feedback we called for fresh towels on saturday evening reception answered and said they would be up shortly and they never came no one came by or said anything we also wanted help with a certain restaurant reservation and while i realized it was christmas weekend and a very very popular time of year both staff members were very resistant to make the phone call to see if there were any last minute cancellations i would have appreciated immediately picking up the phone to check we only had days in barcelona might as well try
