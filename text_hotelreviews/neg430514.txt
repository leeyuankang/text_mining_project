we booked a room which has a window only to the internal lobby area no street view no natural light and literally shows the elevators we upgraded it and got an amazing corner room but still if there was no option to do that this is a room that could have killed our holiday for me i wonder how anyone thought of this idea as an interior designer working with architects i would never have suggested that i came across this info about the room in the comments asked about it and forgot so it s not the hotel s fault but again all the rooms facing the inner space with no street view or hardly natural light horrible idea
