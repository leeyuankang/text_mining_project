check in wasnt very smooth as the transaction through card was declined by the hotels bank so i had to pay by travel money i had in person and because of the card decline i wasn t able to access the money that i had sent to their bank this left me with euro less spending money though i got the money back hrs later it was just a inconvenience and not a great start to our break away though after this issue the hotel was faultless for our stay here and was a splendid place to stay
