i unknowingly didn t take the breakfast option or forgot to email request it and they only reminded me about this after i had paid on arrival not a huge problem logistically as you can put it on the room and pay later but i would have liked to have selected the option and paid with the room in one go and it s definitely worth taking breakfast so check your booking but that s really my only complaint
