the rooms do not have any sound insulation you really hear everything people talking in the next room staff using vacuum cleaners doors opening and closing the noise from the street as other hotels in spain have the same problem exzeption w hotel in barcelona i suppose that spanish architects are not able to plan good sound insulations thus i recommend german architects they are absolutely able to implement a good sound insulation in the corridor there is rubbish from the rooms nearly all the day no seperate elevators for the staff
