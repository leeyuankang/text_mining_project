the curtains let in quite a lot of light and also the position of the bed means that your head is actually underneath the curtain which means the light shines on your face in the morning got to the point where we had to put the pillows on the other side of the bed didn t know how to use coffee machine which was a shame as it looked great the lifts are probably the worst feature of the whole hotel very slow to open doors and come to your floor sometimes the point that we had to climb flights of stairs pool was very very shallow and not very big these were just minor criticisms as the hotel was absolutely fantastic
