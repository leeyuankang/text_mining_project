our room was directly below the weight room beware the noise was very annoying we had to change rooms soundproofing is terrible in this hotel didnt get much sleep here room was extremely small for this price and the window was facing inside literally inside the lobby of the hotel so you cant get fresh air or direct sun and there are no hangers to hang a jacket or coat or eyebrow mirror little things in life go a big way for comfort
