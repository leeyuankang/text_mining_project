nice rooms but not confortable we were two adults staying for a week and had to keep almost everything in our suitcases there is just a small closet where you can hang a pair of clothes and the rest is occupied by the nespresso machine the refrigerator and the cups the shower doesnt have a place to put soap or shampoo so everything must stay on the floor air conditioning didnt seem to work bed was changed just one time and it was on the day before we left
