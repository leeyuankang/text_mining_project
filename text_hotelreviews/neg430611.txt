the gym is really tiny and has limited equipment and a cupboard door in there springs open every ten minutes the window from our room looked straight onto a wall so there was no natural light at all which gave it a depressing feel especially as we were there for my mums i would have hoped for a room with a view of some sort and some natural light the lifts are really temperamental and a couple of times i ended up walking many flights of stairs as they just didn t arrive at my floor
