the lifts were very slow and at one point it stopped completely when i was alone scary though the breakfast was nice not good value too expensive although there were glasses and bottles of wine at reception i didn t see anyone getting offered a drink i had written when booking that a room with a view would be appreciated as we were on our first wedding anniversary not mentioned on arrival and no view
