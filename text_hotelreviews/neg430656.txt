the housekeepers were a little unobservant as they didn t replace the tissues box which only had one tissue in it on our arrival there was no coffee in the drinks cupboard o our arrival and they didn t replace the tea or coffee during our stay or the shampoo and shower gel on the second day these are minor issues and in no way spoilt the experience loved the hotel and we will return
