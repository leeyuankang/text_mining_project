it would have been nice to have tea facilities in te hotel room there was an espresso machine with coffee pods and sugar but no milk or tea this would have been preferred as i m not a coffee fan also it would have been nice to have some conditioner pots there was only shampoo and shower gel but i don t want to complain as it was still very nice
