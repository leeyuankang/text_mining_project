this staff explained that the hotel only opened in late december a week prior to our stay there were tradesmen still working on our floor the loo had an overpowering smell of fresh paint the room had no natural light and was really small and claustrophobic there was no available information about hotel facilities or tourist information the reception staff really tried hard but it is unfair to expect them to operate in a hotel that wasn t ready to open to the public very expensive for a hotel of this quality very disappointing would not recommend
