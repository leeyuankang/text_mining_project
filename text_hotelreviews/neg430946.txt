it s expensive for the facilities on offer and no breakfast included for nights in june was over a weekend but barcelona isn t a cheap city when it comes to hotels rooms much smaller than impression from site the family room was very small with just of us the top bunk very high and right under the air con vent the adult bed was a double not a queen or king more like a large single with one side up against glass wall of bathroom which wasn t very private corridors very dark and hot and can be a bit noisey no bar area onsite to sit and chill car parking close by but expensive at per day but if staying more than days comes down in price that said would consider it again because of location close to restaurants we like but probably not with kids
