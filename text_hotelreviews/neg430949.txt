the bathroom sink smelled like rotten sewage this was our only complaint about the hotel the rooms are not sound proofed at all so expect to hear your annoying neighbor allowing his screaming child to wail in the hallway not an exaggeration the sound is more muted if both parties are in their rooms with the doors closed
