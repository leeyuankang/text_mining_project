need to sack the entire cleaning crew upon arrival we had to move rooms because the first one was infested with aunts second morning they threw the pillows on the bed so they were all over and it was all wrinkly didn t leave us with any hand towels maybe they were on strike or something and it was a way of complaining either way not our problem so they get a negative mark on their cleaning standards
