the hotel is presented and sold as a star hotel and this is not the case it is more a star hotel examples the room size which is under meters wide and with a double bed is very small at the reception they said yes its a small room noise when you are waiting for the lift on the floor you can hear what people are saying and doing in their rooms its near as though there are no doors so a girl on the phone another time a guy having fun in the room the same apply s when you walk in the corridor this is not good for the person in the room or the person who is in the corridor there is one lift and its lost round the back that also seems to be half working the lights are bit disco and it creaks so when you take the stairs because the lift is less available it takes you down an old fashion stairs then a glass dead end but also the halls upstairs and downstairs do not seem that clean sat at the desk in the room i am not tall but the tv is right above your head is no more than or cm from your head but this makes sense with the size of the room were else are you going to put it there is nowhere the bed is on rollers so when i came back to the room after it had been cleaned the side table has kind of disappeared i have never seen this in a hotel before serve yourself drinks down stairs internet access you are in a town that has fast access pay for it this all is understandable and makes sense if it sold as star hotel but it is not the case it was sold as a star room nights paid but we only slept one night we moved to another hotel
