you can tell there was an intention and effort to make the room look elegant and all in all it worked still i have a few observations i cannot help since i also work in this field i would rethink the lighting concept though for my taste there was either too little or too much light and not so many options in between especially in the bathroom where either all light are on or none it would have been nice to have a relaxing bath with soft lights the build in hidden light behind the bed is a nice idea when you are in bed it works great but once you are standing it is quite blinding although the room was clean there were a few black spots in some corners of the bathtub not so bad but also not so attractive
