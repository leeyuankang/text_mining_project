our room was at the back of the building which overlooked a school sports area the noise was terrible after the children stopped playing the adults started which continued until shouting and whistles blowing we had breakfast at the hotel unfortunately the tables were left dirty there were no glasses or milk or cups so very disappointed in view of price euros per person
