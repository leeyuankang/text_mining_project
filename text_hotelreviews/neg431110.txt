problem almost no wifi bandwidth when asking to have wifi fixed i was told that my computer needed update while it was up to date and i commute every week to other hotels where i have no issue with wifi so their wifi network is poor and needs fixing sorry problem the noise made by the elevator i booked a soundproofed room it was soundproofed from other residents from the same floor not from the ceiling though could hear people walking but certainly not soundproofed from the elevator which makes a loud noise each time it is in use
