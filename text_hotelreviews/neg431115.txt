the family room was not laid out particularly well for instance all four of us slept in the same room but there were two very hard double beds we have one boy and girl who had to share a bed not very young children so this was an issue when asked at the reception if they has any mattress toppers or way of making the beds more comfortable we were told no they could not help or offer any assistance an expensive room for the comfort level provided breakfast was also very expensive at euros pppn euros for breakfast i think not so we ate breakfast at one of the many local places for approx euros for all four of us no onsite restaurant for an evening meal if we did not want to venture out
