they truly need help in their management skills i was given questions one afternoon when coming back from the beach as if they were suggesting i weren t a guest there but some transient trust me i wouldn t pretend to stay there if i weren t then when i was leaving the desk guy who helped me hail a taxi actually watched me struggle with my luggage as opposed to helping me i ve received more help from strangers on the street it was the rudest thing i d ever experienced will not be going back i d rather pay more and get human decency in return
