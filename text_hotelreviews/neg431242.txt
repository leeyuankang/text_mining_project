over priced travelled alone and initially given a very small double bed in an extremely small room at in excess of an average of per night this was unacceptable requested a refund to reflect the size of room but offered an alternative twin room instead will be visiting barcelona regularly and will hesitate to use booking com again instead deal with any hotel direct if the price was reasonable would consider this hotel again
