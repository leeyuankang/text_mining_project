mostly the room was hot and stuffy the air conditioning was very weak almost pointless we had it on for days and made little difference to the heat in the room the fridge made a constant ticking noise that was very annoying there was a stench like a dead rodent which possibly came from the drains outside the windows didn t lock to shut out the street noise although that would only make the room hotter
