first of all after the first night we needed to change the room because it was to much noise from the street the windows are not properly sealed so you can hear all the noise from the street even people talking because it s a very crowded street they changed our room whit a smaller one but the bonus was that it was on the back side of the hotel and it had a terasse even there at the first floor you can here and feel the subway train bellow when we changed the room we forgot some clothes t shorts pairs of pants and night dresses so when we figured it out like in about a couple of hours we asked for the reception to check and to bring them to us but to our surprise the clothes was gone they couldn t find them they even asked if we were sure to forget them there after that we didn t trust them to clean the room anymore so we were pretty disappointed that they acted like this for sure i would not come back there anymore also the personal was not friendly at all and the hotel was more like stars and not last year we stayed at a star hotel near the center and it was a far better experience and much cheaper
