staff is the only problem when you enter the hotel at and have a child with you the best scenario is to be welcomed registered and invited to your room rather than spend minutes for check in being asked to pay at check in and beeing charged for the kid even if no extra bed is required maybe the hotel policies would have to specify that extra charge is not for extra bed but simply for kids as i can perfectly understand that also would be good not to answer the phone for some other client in order to minimize the time spent at check in by the client already waitting at pm check out has taken the same amount of time as most probably there are a lot of interns learning hotel bussines there so finaly you have to try to check out with the first one the second one and then finaly the senior one being able to do check out forms
