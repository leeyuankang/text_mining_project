the main week point of the hotel is by far its bathroom if it s not for the bathroom i would have given it a perfect the bathroom has glass walls o o it was very very weird too much intimacy and embarrassment the glass door isn t fully shut no lock no real door frame which means you can hear everything that s going on inside also you can t take a shower or go to the bathroom without your partner in the room seeing you of course that s a vague image and not a completely clear glass but still very weird and embarrassing also if you want to go to the bathroom at night and you turn on the light you are in fact light up the entire room and for people like me that sleep lightly it s a deal breaker every time my wife wanted to go to the bathroom she had to wake me up because of the light other than that the hotel is amazing i wish for them they would change this weird setup of a bathroom that s for me the main reason for not recommending anybody to go there and it s such an amazing hotel besides that that s such a shame
