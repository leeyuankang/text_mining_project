breakfast was fairly expensive per person given the high standard of everything else in the room the sheets felt remarkably cheap and not particularly comfortable we had a junior suite which was laid out somewhat oddly the toilet and shower opened directly onto the main room meaning very little privacy not a problem for a married couple but still potentially awkward for others
