the beautiful pool terrace was in the shade all day and no drinks facility available the pool was icy cold there was mould growing on both jugs of lemonade and iced tea in the gym the hot water coffee machine was painfully slow which made the tea lukewarm by the time it had filled the pot the step up and down from our room was very high and in fact dangerous if it was dark or wet the late check out facility could be managed better i asked the question about a late check out on booking the hotel and never received a response when asking at the reception hours before checkout i could not get a yes or no answer eventually we had checkout at instead of noon but couldn t confirm this until on the day which isn t very helpful
