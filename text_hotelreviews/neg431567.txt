rooms were not sound proof from the inside of the hotel and i could hear guests and staff talking loudly in the corridors it requires elevators to reach the rooms which is an inconvenience i booked a room based on the fact that it had a balcony but unfortunately they had none of those rooms available and with a small additional fee i was upgraded on the day to a great room
