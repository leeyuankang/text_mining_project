staff at the breakfast and snack restaurant were not very unfriendly very stoic and could not care less about their job or the hotel guests who come to eat there we did not like the fact to that breakfast starts at am no flexibility for travellers who have a train to catch really early we missed breakfast due to this as we have a renfe ave train reservation for however the staff at reception was kind enough to pack us sandwich some fruits orange juice and bottled water still it was not the same value for the breakfast we paid but it s better than forfeiting it altogether
