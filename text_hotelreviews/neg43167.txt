none of their deluxe rooms have a good view and when i am saying that is that you will actually see a very large wall of some other building in front of ur window no matter the level u are staying at of course the rooms look way bigger than what u see in the pictures they will never make a refund even they lied u by showing those beautiful pictures and never wrote about the horrible view we were deeply disappointed totally not a place for a romantic holiday they have parties in the lobby and even u are at last floor u can hear them the restaurant seems to be always empty and breakfast looks very poor and uneintresting just meters down the street are excellent restaurants worth trying so why u will stay in an empty space with the almost nothing on the plate
