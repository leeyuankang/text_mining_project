location this is an expensive hotel set to stars but the hotel and its services does not justify the price although it was indicated that its located in the marais area they failed to mention it was in the outskirts of it services and staff the room service didn t apply the basic needs such as toilet paper the breakfast was very poor the buffet offered low range of products and their amount was relatively small the manager of the hotel claimed that we were supposed to ask one of the employees to add more from fridge since it s a small hotel and they can t put it all outside poor and unconvincing excuse in my opinion and generally speaking it felt like they were cheap about everything they offered interior design the hotel interior s was depressing dark and unfriendly rank in one word disappointing i would highly recommended not to go there
