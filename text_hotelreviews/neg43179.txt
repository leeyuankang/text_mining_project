whilst i would stay again there were lots of small problems which this hotel should aim to improve there was only a curtain on one of the two windows one was simply missing the tv could not get reception and i couldn t turn it off so the room was never dark there was simply not enough shower gel provided just small tube per day just sufficient for shower the reception is staffed hrs but they shut the door sometime after midnight and there is no night bell so on two occasions i had to wait outside for about minutes before reception noticed i was outside
