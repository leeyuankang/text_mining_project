i asked for a quiet room with a bathtub but the tv was not working in this room so i had to change and the new room had a shower and was facing the street so there was a lot of noise during the night and i couldn t sleep very well so noisy room service i asked for a snack and all they could propose was the day s special which was pretty particular insects however they suggested some cheese but it was not possible to have a regular snack i thought this was pretty annoying after a long day travelling and the issue with the first room the rooms are fine but i think there could be some improvement to be made it seems like they focused all their attention on the design of the restaurant bar rather than the hotel rooms which is a shame however the staff was very nice and helpful i can t deny it
