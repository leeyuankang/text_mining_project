the hospitality and service was bad the staff at reception does not have enough knowledge to guide a tourist properly wrong or half toutist information was given they charge you euro just for getting extra glass or plate to your room not expected from a star hotel we had special dietary requirements but they were not ready to customize anything for us inspire of informing in advance so we could not opt to include breakfast in our stay
