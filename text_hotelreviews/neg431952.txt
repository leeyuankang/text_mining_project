the roof terrace closes at i ve chosen this hotel because of it as we wanted to watch new year s fireworks from pla a d espanya and avoid going out to the street after staying in other hotels in barcelona where the roof was always open for guests regardless the hour we were very disappointed to find out that it s not available it s understandable that the hotel might want to keep certain schedule but on a night like new years there was a place to enable guests to enjoy the view the roof offer however even though we and several other guests asked for it to be open if only for the min of the fireworks we were met with no explanation a shrug saying that s that very thin walls we were able to hear the snoring man women in the next room and every door that closed in the hall if you e a light sleeper come with good earplugs in the future will rather stay in other hotels which are also close to pla a de catalunya like montcada which i found to be excellent and does much more to give its guests good experience
