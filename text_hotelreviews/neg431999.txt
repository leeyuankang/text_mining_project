the room we stayed was simply unacceptable the door did not shut properly letting light and sound pass throw the window to the street was really old with no soundproofing what so ever and since we were in the floor it was really noisy and we could even hear the conversations of people in the street so we didn t have any sleep that night also you need to sort the parking issue we paid parking only to be delayed min in the parking lot for a second confirmation of payment from the hotel staff
