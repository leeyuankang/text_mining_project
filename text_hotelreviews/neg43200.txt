staff is badly organized value for money is poor a design hotel with cheap furniture night side table wheel broke of lighting concept is inadequate only one lift worked during our stay we were on the floor the halloween party in the lobby was a disaster we waited to order a drink for halve an hour since it took the bar tender about minutes for two drinks he was also all alone to serve the entire bar when we finally could order they didn t have mint to make mochitos we pointed out to them that there was mint but then they didn t have knives to cut the limes so again we waited for minutes in between a waitress took an order for a cuba libre but it never was served the bar was messy and the staff clearly totally overburdened this hotel is way too expensive for what they have to offer
