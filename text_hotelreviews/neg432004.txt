we had a basic room and the sink is in the bedroom on a very small shelf it wasn t the most practical arrangement and as the sink was very small the water splashed over the shelf and floor so it was difficult to keep makeup etc dry however we had friends in standard rooms and their bathrooms were completely separate which was a much better arrangement
