the pitch dark corridors and lifts i stayed at with my friend from august our otherwise excellent stay was marred by a disturbing accident whichi wanted to share as i feel it poses a risk for serious injury the corridors are pitch dark with no light on my my girlfriend s last day of stay in paris we were returning to our room it was the last room at the far end of the corridor and due to darkness she couldn t see and judge the end of the corridor kept walking and walked into the end of corridor wall door hitting her face hard and falling to the ground with bleeding swollen nose being a doctor i could see the nose fractured i called the staff straightaway they brought some ice right away but no follow up calls were made by the staff to enquire about my friend s wellbeing or to offer any assistance in finding out if she needed medical assistance in a foreign for us city i am australian and my friend is belgian due to this accident my belgian friend who was to leave for brussels that evening had to cancel her trip back to brussels and stayed an extra night as we didn t feel she was okay to travel with the swollen nose face and a risk of developing concussion from the head injury she had a nose fracture but we were thankful that there was no concussion it took few weeks for her nose to heal the hotel staff did put a lamp outside in the corridor but it was gone the next day as a medical doctor i feel its not safe to have such degree of darkness in the corridors i have stayed at similar themed hotels around the world with dark corridors but this is a new level of darkness they usually have the room numbers illuminated which provide some light to see and find the room i understand the hotel has a theme and the dim lighting is a big part of the styling there should be some light atlas for safety purposes so that no one else suffers in future
