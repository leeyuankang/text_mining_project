on the april we booked a night stay checking in on the of august we made a special request for a double room when we arrived we were shown a twin room and told there were no double rooms available when we protested we were reluctantly shown a sub standard double room which should have no place in a star hotel they then said the would put the beds together which they did we accepted and it turned out ok
