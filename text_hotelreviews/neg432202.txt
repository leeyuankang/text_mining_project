although all staff are very polite and professional during my last day and my breakfast whilst i was already checked out and waiting for my ride to airport one of the waiters approached me and ask where i am from i am not from ukraine as it shows only working there after my response he started to make offensive and political statements namely against my country or the name of my country his country of origin was greece i had no time to report him to reception or to the manager due to rushing to the airport i felt uncomfortable and it was inappropriate by him to even start such conversation with hotel guests especially if particular customer is often a guest of the hotel hope the hotel manager advises staff to be correct and not to get involved in political discussions with guests
