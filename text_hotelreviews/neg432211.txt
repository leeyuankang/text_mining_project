i booked a double room for single use but i was disappointed how small the room i got was nothing like in the pictures on the hotel website or booking com i guess they gave me one of the smaller rooms just because it was single use the bathroom was also tiny although well equipped and the noise you heard in the room when somebody upstairs or in the neighboring rooms flushed a toilet or was having a shower was very loud generally not stars in my books the hotel is in a need of a face lift so i think it s slightly over priced breakfast was very nice but it was served only until am although it was a bank holiday weekend and it was very difficult to find a seat because of course everyone wanted to come as late as possible
