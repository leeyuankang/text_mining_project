the hotel and the rooms are quite outdated and worn out the room decoration was sparse and had a cheap feel to it the shower was installed in a old bath tub which made it uncomfortable to shower cleanliness was poor as i often found hairs from the cleaning staff on the floor and towels also there was mold growing near the ceiling in the bathroom because of inadequate ventilation breakfast seemed elaborate but the quality of the products was mediocre all in all this is not a star hotel
