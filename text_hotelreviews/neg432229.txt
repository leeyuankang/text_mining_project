pillows are bad absolutely no support flat down onto bed when you lay your head on top hot shower will turn cold after a while location is a bit far from old city centre breakfast is overcrowded food is lacking however restaurant food served for dinner was good staffs service attitude not warm and helpful they recommended big bus which has a stop in front of the hotel big bus routes are restrictive frequency is few half an hour apart and waited once for mins but not showing up unworthy experience on big bus
