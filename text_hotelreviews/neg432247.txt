the first night i had guest my sister and i paid extra but nobody bothered to give us extra pillow and blanket and tissues also it was a really cold room the first morning we went down to the coffee shop and the waitress told us that the breakfast is until we just asked to bring us sth and that i was happy to pay extra she was really rood and that behaviour was the same the next day also in the reception only one person was smiling and was ready to help i am totally disappointed with the staff
