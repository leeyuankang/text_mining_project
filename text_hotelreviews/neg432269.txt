the staff could be more friendly and helpful the staff in the breakfast were rude and one told me to hurry up as they were closing soon when i arrived for breakfast the male reception staff did not help me with my bags as i was leaving and i had to get a taxi in the street with all my bags in the rain the review does not apply to all staff but left an image that was negative
