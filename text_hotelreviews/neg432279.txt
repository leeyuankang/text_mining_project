dont book a taxi to the airport through the hotel we got a taxi from the airport for euros when we asked if the hotel could prebook a taxi for our return they quoted us euros even though the information pack in the room states that they offer a discount you can get one from the taxi rank right in front of the hotel for a set price of euros
