the hospitality of the hotel is way under four stars we kept having issues about hygiene even at the end of a four night stay the mattresses were probably years old and we had to insist first night at pm that they were replaced metal spirals poking out instead of leaving the nice room for another we had so much complaints and we visit a lot of hotels and almost never have an issue and we never spoke a manager during the whole days we stayed there annoying and incredible they gave us a little pie at our leave thanks regina
