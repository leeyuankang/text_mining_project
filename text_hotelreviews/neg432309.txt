there was no wifi reception in my room at all despite the promise on booking com the staff claimed it was a temporary problem but as a matter of fact wifi coverage doesn t cover all the rooms and if yours is further down the corridor you won t get the signal since i was on a business trip that was a real dealbreaker and it goes without saying that the hotel refused to give me a different room with working wireless internet the room was rather tidy yet it definitely needed a renovation in certain areas power outlets were rather wobbly and tended to follow the plug when i pulled it out flush buttons in the restroom also were not properly secured in the wall finally the hotel froze the full amount of money for my stay on my credit card four days before i even arrived despite the fact that the free cancellation was until one day before arrival and the money were released only after two weeks so for a period of time i was effectively double charged to summarize i would not recommend this hotel there are much cheaper and better offers in the area
