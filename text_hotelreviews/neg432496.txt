it was not comfortable to sleep there the bed was quite small but the most uncomfortable thing is the length of the bed it was short i m cm heigh and if you use pillow your legs will be not on the bed i didn t sleep also because of our neighbors we have stayed in the room the other room has a bed with a head to the same wall our neighbors had sex all night long and the wall moved some times and their bed squeaked very annoying last time i woke up at am it was not nice carton walls the other thing was water from shower it was leaking to the corridor in our room the hooks for towels were installed just right above the toilet of course towels can fall sometimes guess where we had view from the window to some dirty wall
