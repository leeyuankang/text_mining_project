the first night i checked in i asked for a dental kit and the receptionist told me that the housekeeper is gone and he doesn t know where is the dental kit the second morning i asked again and the other person just took it out from the reception desk the staff is not well trained and i do understand they don t have enough people but every time i ask for something i need to go down and get it by my self that is a little bit annoying
