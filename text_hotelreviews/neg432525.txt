sorry i don t usually do this but i wouldn t want anyone looking as forward to this place as much as me get disappointed it says room soundproof but it is not this was the most annoying thing if you are there to relax as a couple most of the time forget about it both rooms we stayed in nights were poorly isolated you can hear people s conversation from the other room walking in heels at as if they were in yours earing them snoring at night earring them going to the bathroom flushing their toilets listening to music watching tv absolutely everything all four nights which means they can also hear us and i imagine it s annoying if you hope to sleep in later than in the morning forget about it too the ladies are doing the housekeeping which is normal but as the walls are so thin you will hear them and it will wake you up the noise goes from to approximately sometimes later than that depending on the rooms to do on the floor you can hear them very loudly moving furniture or plugging the vacuum in the wall and your wall vibrates yes and if they put music to enjoy their day which i salute unfortunately if you had planned on sleeping in then no forget about it you will hear their phones or their little speakers again i m not saying it s bad to listen to music i completely understand them however i just wish the walls weren t so thin that we wouldn t have to listen if we want to sleep i ve stayed inside big cities before this hotel can really do better regarding the noise the beds slip there s nothing you can do about it they re extremely light and slip very easily the mattresses weren t so comfortable either maybe it s that i expected more and i m sorry for that but no we didn t find them very comfortable the shower jets didn t work you get options to get the water under your shower
