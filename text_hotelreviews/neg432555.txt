the bed was not comfortable and too noisy and the walls were thin as paper i couldn t sleep one single total night you can ear people talking clearly i have stayed for nights and they gave me the worst room they have with view to some house s terrace with trousers hanged unfortunately the best price on booking corresponds always to a room like this it s the same like sleeping in the underground the breakfast was really poor no healthy food the reception workers were just not nice or helpful i always need a taxi and i have only asked for help on the first day he have asked me for a taxi and told me min it took minutes for a taxi to arrive and he gave it to another clients in the hotel i have arrived late to work it s just not acceptable i really can manage myself and ask for my own taxi and that was what i have done for that day and all the others not a good experience
