the room was freezing on arrival touch ages to work the system out and at least an hour to warm up the room the shower was cranky and quite old took forever to wash my hair overall decent hotel but the price reflects the location not the hotel i wouldn t pay that amount anywhere else for the type of hotel but it is expected i suppose in central london
