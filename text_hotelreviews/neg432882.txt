the staff around the pool and the pool restaurant did nothing to manage some very obnoxious children and teenagers in the pool we literally couldn t even sit in our son chairs and get some sun because these children super so poorly behaved and were splashing water and other guests the staff clearly should ve manage this and did not the pool area is also very short on lounge chairs and there are too many tables for food and beverage that are just not being used this whole experience really makes the pool area of no value
