we had a bag stolen from the small restaurant at breakfast on our first morning it was captured on cctv and the perpetrators entered through the main door of the hotel past reception and past the restaurant staff despite our foolishness in our view the security needs to be improved all the staff were kind empathic and helpful but it would have been good if they had contacted the police directly as we lost a whole day of a very short break reporting the theft making statements etc we had half board and felt the choices of main course was too limiting a milk jug for our breakfast tea would have been a nice addition but that s just plain pernickety
