check in was very disappointing since we were coming from a cruise ship we knew we would arrive earlier than the stated check in time i called booking com about a month before our arrival date about an early check in since it did not print out on my reservation form when i reserved the room on line booking com called the hotel and they said they could not guarantee an early check in but they would do their best then i phoned the hotel the day before our arrival to confirm i was told that they could not guarantee but would do their best when we arrived we were greeted by sara who was very pleasant she checked us in and let us know our room was not ready yet and checked in our luggage about a half hour after we arrived a large group going to meet a cruise ship checked out of the hotel several other groups arrived at the hotel a bit later and were checked in and shown to their rooms we asked if there was an idea when our room would be available we were told maybe another hour after another hour we asked again and were told it would be another hours at this point we had been waiting hours and many other people had come in after us and were checked in after another minutes i noticed one of the hotel staff take our luggage in to the elevator i asked sara if our room was now ready since i saw our luggage being taken into the elevator without checking anything she said your room will not be ready for another hour i asked where our luggage was going then she then looked in the computer got us confused with some other couple and then said oh your room is now ready hours we sat in the lobby if they would have been honest with us up front and told us there was no early check in if you are not with a group we would have booked a tour we would have even been happy to pay if there was an extra charge for early check in but were given the impression they would do their best this is not your best
