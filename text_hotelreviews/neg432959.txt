we requested an early check in prior to arrival when we arrived at mid day we were told the room wasn t ready and we should return at we duly returned at and told it would not be ready until we had been up from and were tired and needed to refresh ourselves very disappointed with that treatment i don t think the reception staff even contacted the housekeeping staff to see if it could be ready sooner
