we stayed at this hotel for nights in mid august if it was for the first night my classification would be very low because they gave us a room with a queen size bed and we had an email confirmation for a king size bed and one of the front desk attendants could not manage with the problem in a professional way moreover we found that the room was not properly cleaned but in the end they solved the problem in a perfect way which shows they really care about their clients
