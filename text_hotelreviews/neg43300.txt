the hotel is very expensive we booked the deluxe double at extra cost on arrival the desk staff told us our room was a bit outdated and small but we could upgrade for an additional this was disappointing as we d spent a lot of money for a nicer standard of room and to be told on arrival our room was a bit substandard before we d even seen it was a bit upsetting the room was indeed small and quite basic the breakfast was a little disappointing as there wasn t a particularly large selection
