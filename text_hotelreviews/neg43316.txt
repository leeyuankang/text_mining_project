unfortunately our room was located next to the very noisy lift our bathroom sink took about minutes to drain obviously a problem with the drains could just have been our room the only other negative to a pleasant stay was the cost of drinks in the bar on the first night we had a small beer and a glass of wine after coming in from a great day out euros needless to say we didn t use the bar again
