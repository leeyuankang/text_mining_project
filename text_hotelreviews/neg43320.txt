the room we booked was too old and too small and we upgraded to another renovated one and ended up paying fashion week fair an extra per night the room was not clean although we informed the receptionist on our way out but when we came back it wasn t cleaned either on our last days our used cups of tea were still on the table and there was no water refill in the mini bar the sink still had our toothpaste traces we called housekeeping and they assured us they will clean up once we leave for dinner and when we came back the room was still the same the beds are not very comfy and they have a heating chauffage in the bathroom that is burning hot and so wronly placed that we both burned our hands and arms the breakfast is very poor in variety and presentation although the breakfast staff were very friendly apon checking out we told the receptionist about the lack of cleanliness there was no apology he only said he will inform them
