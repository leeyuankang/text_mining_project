maybe an airport ride offered when the taxis are on strike maybe a shuttle service when this happens it happened to me the subway is very easy to use clean and cheap a print out of the metro to the airport the fares and how to buy the tickets although the receptionist was very kind and explaned to me gave me a map i was still very nervous about taking the subway i bought one extra ticket that i did not need but overall it was very easy to go to the airport indeed there is no need for a permanent shuttle for the airport is almost at your doorstep from this hotel
