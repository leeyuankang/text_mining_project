on our first night we noticed already that the bed they gave us is quite small for persons i complained and requested to be transferred asap according to them they can not transfer us that same night because its impossible they were insistent that our room has a standard bed for persons to prove my point i went to my parents room and measured it by hand i even took a picture to prove that ours was really smaller in the end they apologised and said that indeed that room we got on our first night had a smaller sized bed yes we got transferred the following night in a room exactly the same as my parents but the damaged has been done we had back pains and did not sleep well
