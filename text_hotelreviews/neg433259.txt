the room we booked was not available when we arrived so we were disappointed to be placed in a fairly dark room with no window for natural light it was also very noisy from around that morning luckily the staff moved us the next day albeit to a tiny room much smaller than the first with not much room for people to live for nights so not too happy that our intended room was unavailable our shower also leaked which lead to a virtually flooded bathroom every morning not ideal we ate in the hotel restauraunt one evening as we were too tired to venture out and this was a huge mistske the service was slow and the food was cold and not cooked properly but there are plenty of nice restaurants in the vicinity to enjoy
