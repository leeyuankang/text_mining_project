the room did not satisfy us because of it was an economic room they gave us a room which we couldn t see the outside the window was only openning to the closed hall of the hotel we couldn t see the sun for a short stay that could be ok but when you want to sleep and open that window for some air the voices of people talking and laughing at the lobby disturbs a lot maybe we could ask to change our room however that was a nights stay so we tolerated it
