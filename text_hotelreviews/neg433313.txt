we were in room on check in we were asked if we wanted to upgrade the room at cost as our room faced the street and was noisy sure enough it was very noisy with a lull at till it wouldn t have so bad but the window was years old and did not shut properly the whole front window facade needs replacing i could have complained but did not as the rest of the hotel and staff were wonderful
