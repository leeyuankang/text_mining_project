the first room we were given room was right next to an atrium and extremely noisy we arrived late so we didn t realise this until we were woken before with what sounded like hundreds of people in our room once we complained we were given a room on the floor which was perfect there is no way anyone should be put in room it is disgraceful that the hotel would expect someone to pay for this room only being there for two night half the trip was ruined i don t think we should have been charged for the first night
