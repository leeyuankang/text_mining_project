when we arrived at the reception they had water for guests but we were not offered any the rooms were extremely small the service at the room garden was unacceptable we were told we could have dinner there but there was no waiter there while when we called for one we were informed dinner would be served on beach beds or sittinf on stools at a very small bar type area do they think we are idiots
