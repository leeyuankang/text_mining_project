breakfast was underwhelming the breakfast staff were over stretched and not very helpful i would have expected a much better service and much better food from a hotel of this kind and price overall breakfast was very disappointing we knew this was an expensive hotel but that was ok as it was our anniversary and the location suited us however the prices in the bar room service etc were extortionate after two days we stopped eating in the hotel and certainly had our drinks elsewhere euros for two sandwiches and a bottle of wine
