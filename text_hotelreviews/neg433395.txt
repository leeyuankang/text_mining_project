check your hotel bill carefully i had the small breakfast every day and that was missed but i was charged for the buffet breakfast i reviewed my bill the day before i left and brought this to their attention and it was corrected no problem also my room was booked and paid in advance through booking com however the hotel duplicated the full room charge after i departed over euros even though on checkout i had confirmed with the front desk that the room had been paid in full in advance the duplicate charge was posted to my credit card after i arrived home so i contacted booking com and the issue was corrected took a couple of days hint make sure you stay on top of the exchange rate because the refund is often less than the charge so it takes extra effort to get full credit
