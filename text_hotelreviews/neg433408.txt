the taxi driver was trying to rip us off we booked the cab with a hotel taxi driver was talking very loudly during our drive back to the airport at one point he started making notes when still driving with one hand on wheel when we got to the airport although the meter said he added on the top of it which we said we are not going to pay he could not speak any english so this wasn t useful at all my advice for others is to book a private cab over the internet
