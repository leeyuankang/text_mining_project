i wouldn t book this hotel for a view of the sagrada famously it is shrouded in scaffolding and netting and the view was pretty appalling to be honest book this hotel for its proximity to not view of the sagrada the view was a bit of a let down but not the fault of the hotel obviously the view will improve with the work on the building in about years time
