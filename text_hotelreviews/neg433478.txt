to get a view to sagrada familia you need to pay for each night so we get a room to street view rooms were not cleaned in high level as every time we were asking to bring a soap and towels also bed was small for people and not comfortable room square was very small under bed there is dust everytime location is near sagrada familia but this is not center and you need to get taxi or to get metro and change lines to reach the hotel from the city center
