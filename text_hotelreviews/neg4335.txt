the single room was very small and completely misrepresented in booking com it was really claustrophobic and tiny i could not upgrade and there was no fridge the worse that happened to me was when had to stay another night and checked online that they had available room and when i went to the front office to ask if i should book online or direct he informed me that the hotel was fully booked and if i booked online he would honour it but he would rush before me to close the bookings worse hotel experience ever
