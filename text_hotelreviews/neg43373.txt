the temperature of the water is continuously changing making it impossible to adjust the right temperature so when you take a shower you freeze or burn in cycles although i ask the reception they couldn t solve the problem this is not acceptable at this class of a hotel i would also expect an espresso machine and an iron in the room the sports facilities are for show and has a very small space but i think few people care for them
