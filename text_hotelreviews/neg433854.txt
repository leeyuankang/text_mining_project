the room was not always cleaned properly and on one occasion we came back to floor not vacuumed and some bedding on floor not many sachets for tea coffee was not really happy with all staff as request made at booking three months previously was not addressed very well when i asked receptionist just told busy from bookings made a year ago why was i not told at checkin rather than wait for me to chase only to be told would look into next day of course it never happened this was sad as i had made comment that it was an important anniversary return trip to vienna thank goodness for the sights
