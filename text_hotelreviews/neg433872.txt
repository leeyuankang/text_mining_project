i was given a quite small room for standard double room i was given a room with a lot less space since i have a huge wall cutting off the space of the room looks really different from the picture location is not too close to the city center requires minimum walk of minutes location is also a bit hidden in a small alley that does not feel safe at night at one point the electricity in my room went off and only after i called the reception that they got this fixed ac works centrally so if you feel warm you can t turn it on
