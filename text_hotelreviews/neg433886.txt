the location was a bit off the centre takes some time to get in and out if you want to walk the room service were noisy since the morning you could hear the vacuum cleaner hitting the walls they talk with a very loud voice there were some strange noises at night coming from the walls seemed like heating related but it was annoying the staff were helpful but didn t seem exactly keen they seemed too serious and not very friendly
