we had two minor problems the first was about the inconsistency of the wifi service within the hotel and our room this is becoming a typical problem we encounter and so i use the hot spot feature on my smart phone when the hotel s service is fussy the second is a no harm no foul story i had asked the hotel to arrange car service from the airport to the hotel they did and we were met by a very energetic driver who moved through the substantial traffic like nikki lauder the race car driver however upon arrival at the hotel he asked for euros instead of the euro quote from the hotel we came to a very quick understanding in spite of the driver s gradually disappearing english he took euros with a smile but did not help carry the luggage up the stairs a couple of days later when i felt comfortable with the staff i mentioned the incident to the hotel s apparent manager who wanted more information and for the remainder of our stay apologized on behalf of the hotel and the car service whose owner wanted to know who that driver might have been i explained that no harm had been done and that as travelers we expect these sorts of things and just wanted the hotel to know what happened for the benefit of future guests who might not be so understanding
