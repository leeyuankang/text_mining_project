didn t like the wooden floors as you could hear the maids walking about in the mornings at the end of our stay we were nearly charged for bottles of water from the room which we never used drank just keep an eye out on that when you stay there was also miscommunication at the end of our stay as the staff member at reception tried to make us repay for our stay even though we paid at the start this was resolved quickly
