didn t like the pillows very soft asked the reception for firm ones but said they didn t have a different kind offered to give us two extra pillows of the same kind which didn t do the trick either hours without hor water when i asked the reception in the morning they said it was a technical problem and that they would have fixed it by the same evening however the problem remained no hot water in the evening either i had to wait until the next morning to take a shower on the last day of our nights stay wifi didn t work at all although it was working well the days before when askink the reception they said they had fixed it but it still wasn t working breakfast was way too expensive eur per person didn t try it preferred to have breakfast at the viennese cafes instead
