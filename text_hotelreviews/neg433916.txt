we paid per night which is pretty much for the room we got first we booked a junior suite with balcony was very important and didnt get one they let us sleep in an other junior suite which was really terrible for excuse we get a voucher for two drinks which seems like a big joke cause the room was really not comparable with the room next day we get we re really disappointed cause is a good name hotel and we can t believe that we paid for so much for this creepy room
