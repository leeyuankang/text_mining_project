we booked a price offer which i appreciate but the room we were given was facing a wall which was never stated or implied on top it was at a building across the street from the main one of the hotel which had no reception so the feeling is a bit weird a bit like a hostel perhaps i think customers should be made aware and be given the chance other than that all good
