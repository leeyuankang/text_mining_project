the nice entrance was a facade the room was expensive it was small the furniture was old the lock on the room door had previously been broken and there was broken wood the bathroom did not have a separate shower but was attached to the bath overall the room was very disappointing and not what we expected from a star hotel the food was very expensive and we did not eat breakfast there for that reason
