the restaurant could have better breakfast options dont forget to mention the early late check in check out when you are booking which happens at some nominal charges or else you happen to leave the hotel at a tensed state it happened to me and it was really a bad feeling as the hotels in europe has a check out time at pm and if you have a flight at or pm then its kinda discomfort but again you can spend those hours exploring the place and that will compensate for the stress the rooms does not have a lock system per se so that you are not disturbed inspite of the warning signs left at the door handle the cleaners have access and they tend to enter the room and that might be discomforting at times however they are doing their job of keeping our rooms clean and they are really nice to the guests always acknowledging and conversing with a friendly smile
