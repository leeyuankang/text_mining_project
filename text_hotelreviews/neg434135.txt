nothing of any great significance the only minor note is that the shower bath wash basin and bed were all open plan although the toilet is separate there was only one lift and as the rooftop bar was very popular at times the lift took a moment or two to arrive mostly we used the lift at off peak times so was not a big issue for us even though we were on the floor
