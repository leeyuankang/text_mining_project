now the bad bits we upgraded to master suite on top floor with clear view of the city however we had two flat screen smart tvs that were not usable due to fact there are no english channels and no english translation option and smart tv function was disabled the only channels available were news channels the hotel interior is starting to show wear tear in the room and else wear the windows in bloom were poorly cleaned and there were smears and most surfaces including windows there were several details that need attention to bring it up to standard things like old stickers there have been removed and glue still remain cracked tiles in lift and no information in room on how to call down to reception shower door needs attention i must say overall we were happy with every
