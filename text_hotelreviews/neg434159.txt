my only complaint is that the room had a few features that were tricky to figure out the light switches could be finicky and we had to have the staff fix the switch that controlled the lights in the bedroom there are electric blinds that took some practice to figure out how to use and i never figured out how to turn on the ac it was actually a little warm at night in the room even in october overall great experience however
