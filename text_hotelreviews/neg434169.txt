hotel staffs were very weird they don t help at all and when you try to ask them they replay with short answer and making the atmosphere tension i mean they make you feel that you would never ask again in addition they have no parking for the cars you would go around for long time to get the chance of finding a space whichs other five stars hotel do have as the mentioned hotel calmed they are five stars to sum up i would never go to that hotel again i ve been in vienna many times the time i really hated it when i had to experienced that type of hotel
