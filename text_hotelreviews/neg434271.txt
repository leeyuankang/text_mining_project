the pillows were old and lumpy breakfast was a nightmare ended up in bar area running back and forth to get cooked breakfast a couple of items at a time the hot food tasted nice at least what we managed to get so many items ran out and not replaced quickly we usually do ale our time but gave up and left really disappointing
