the breakfast was poor cold i asked for it to be microwaved and they did as i asked not sure how hygienic this is but they did do as i requested the main menu was limited and pricey i would have loved macaroni cheese or omelette something simple the usb s between our beds were non operational did not work having to charge appliance and sit on floor or chair which kept springing back when you rested your back on it i did not like that there was not a hand rail at the bath for support i cannot think why this would not be there already the cold tap function was difficult to operate it remained hot at wash hand basin i had to adjust taps allot to get it to come on the room service and breakfast menu options were there we did not use surcharge here and there put us off also we had a very early flight and continental breakfast alone did not start until so we could not even order that when checked out i mentioned to reception he basically said did you not say to reception yesterday having had an extremely sweaty day we just wanted to go to room and we didn t manage back out of room as we were exhausted from activities and we were packing and trying to rest on trying to pick breakfast at from door menu we noticed the time restraints so we did not get breakfast on departure which we were not reimbursed for also requested taxi hotel had taxi service there so we took it he in my opinion ripped us off i have his registration number the taxi to property from london city airport was tip not compulsory the taxi from propriety to airport was i did not give a tip vnt very disappointed with his charge as no meter was on display i don t mind paying for a good service but i knew the taxi wouldn t cost anymore that and he basically charged us what he wanted
