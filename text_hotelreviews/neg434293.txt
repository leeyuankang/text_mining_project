i wasn t happy with the lack of welcoming from the staff we had a problem checking in as we were told we could pay on departure i wasn t getting paid until the next day so we had to wait hours in reception for my brother during this time the staff didn t even bat a smile help us in any way or give us an option being a manager myself i do all i can do help customers and at least try to accomodate them amy way i can the manager on shift was absolutely rubbish not a smile not a welcome her tone was disgusting saying this myself and my partner have just come back from a week spent in a in spain for half board the staff were amazing welcoming and brilliant the staff at the crowne plaza hotel could benefit from a bit of training instead of snooting their noses down at people manners don t cost nothing either we paid for the most rubbish night breakfast not included aswell for that price absolutely ridiculous my partner cut himself on the door stop in the room bearing in mind this is on the floor in the middle of the wardrobe next to the door with no warning the one in the bathroom had a rubber around it whereas this one didn t we couldn t open the window in our room my partner had no sleep because the air con wasn t working and the view was awful overall the hospitality was disgraceful i will not be staying here again you were rubbish i would rather go abroad and if need to stay in london again i will book elsewhere arrange some team training and the manager should spend some time with her team and teach them some skills rather than walk around with her hands in her pockets thinking she is the bees knees i am big on people skills and team building with my own team and she was the worst manager i have ever seen
