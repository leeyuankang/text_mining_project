having to pay per day for parking is overpriced especially since the space is extremely limited the representation of the room online is not what you actually get the room was very small for an executive room we ordered our breakfast to be brought upstairs which came in a timely manner however on the first day the food was extremely cold burnt and cold toast the bacon was hardly cooked and the scrambled egg was inedible the second day i requested for my food to be well done so i received burnt bacon burnt sausage and the same scrambled egg with cold toast being breakfast was included i still had to pay a tray charge because of the breakfast i did not bother go to the restaurant i went out to eat other than that the hotel is well presented
