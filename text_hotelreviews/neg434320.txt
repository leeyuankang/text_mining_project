sadly the spa facilities let it down no prior notice that swim lessons were on so pool partitioned off adults watching across what was left plus kids in the bit not being used for lessons and in the jacuzzi which ruined it for us as was a small space anyhow and was advertised as relaxing spa that it was not prior notice at reception would have been good for hotel guests as we would have gone at a time around the lessons
