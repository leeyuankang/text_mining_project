the main reason why i chose this hotel was the pool which has an acceptable size however it s just a depth of m everywhere and the water was a little opaque and smelled a little like ammonia well who does a bit of research knows what that means also the whirl pool had lots of foam but not the kind of foam you would want to find inside a whirl pool it seems they do not exchange the water very often what felt a bit disgusting i just found it annoying i had to request a comb tooth brush cotton buds separately and they had to bring it to my room but then forgot the cotton buds the sound insulation of the room walls and especially of the front door could have been a bit better but i only woke up once at night due to a group of people passing by my room having loud conversations with lots of laughter
