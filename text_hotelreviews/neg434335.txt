for a head the buffet breakfast was appalling for three mornings on the trot the hash browns were cold and floppy tomatoes dried up beans ok mushrooms ok on two days and on the third undercooked muesli was nice my colleague said the bacon wasn t great but i didn t have any fried eggs looked good though and were being made fresh on view we even didn t like the marmalade which was most bizarre so i don t know if we were just unlucky and had an off one i ve had much nicer and cheaper breakfasts at a premier inn but i guess with buffets it very much depends on your timing as to how long food has been sat out we booked a room with air con but most of the rooms don t actually have air con so after a boiling night with what we thought was faulty air con we found out that on our floor it has two chillers that cool the whole floor and one of them had broken down so the other was working over hard and not managing we were moved to a floor with air con which was amazing but the fridges in both rooms didn t work but there is ice on each floor so we used that to keep our drinks cool
