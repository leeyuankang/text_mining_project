the hair dryer nozzle did not fit the hairdryer in the room there were no robes in the room to use for the spa we had to call reception for them they did arrive quickly but were of poor quality and the hoops for the belt were broken the staff in the bar area did not speak very good english it was hard to order anything from the cocktail list without pointing it out the main issue for me was the spa there were lots of families with the children jumping in and out of the hot tub and steam room the hot tub and steam room should be made adults only for those who have left their children at home and would like to relax
