sadly our room had a very strong smell of mould which seemed to be coming from the bathroom the bed and bathroom did look clean but i couldn t help but wonder what was causing the awful smell i was also disappointed with the pool area which was very crowded so swimming lengths was almost impossible also the stairs to the pool and the floors weren t clean particularly in the women s changing room and the showers needed attention too sadly the spa facilities were more reminiscent of a public swimming baths
