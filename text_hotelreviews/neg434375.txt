upon arrival what appeared to be a supervisor shouting at a member of cleaning staff was a little of what was yet to come when we came back after evening out around we thought maybe we could pick up a leaflet from the gym and see the pool we got out of the lift and we re immediately comforted and questioned how we got there and told we shouldn t be there the young ladies tone was very degrading and after we quickly turned around for the lift she got in the lift with us and a colleague and continued to question how and why we got there it appeared to be a fault that the lift shouldn t go to that floor although i didn t see this as our fault the intension was to use the facilities and treatments the next day but felt we were not welcome which is a shame and will not be booking again
