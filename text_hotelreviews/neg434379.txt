on arrival the staff made it clear that as i had booked via booking com not to expect any perks or room upgrades as this would only be possible with a direct booking which is fine the pool area was dated but at least clean the amount of chemicals used in the jacuzzi was burning my eyes so be warned i decided to order some room service only to be told that this was unavailable and that i had to use external services the staff member on the phone was rude and offered nothing in the form of an explanation or apology in the morning checking out i raised these issues with the front desk and they had no knowledge of there being room service available the night before and offered no form of customer care i d suggest to anyone spending money on a place to stay in london there are much better places
