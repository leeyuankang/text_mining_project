i made the mistake of going to the pool at on a friday morning although we were told that there would be children in the pool this in itself was fine the fact that not only did i not have anywhere to sit or place my clothes whilst changing all space taken by mothers with masses of bags and not one would move anything and the constant kids slamming the locker doors and running around unguarded and to top it all having to hold my towel up against myself whilst one woman decided it was a great idea to film her child walking around the changing room i was naked and didn t want my body shown to everyone on instagram facebook or the family video this should be banned i love kids and understand the baggage that comes with them but some of these mothers were not only rude they let their kids run riot and filmed in the changing room this ruined my whole night away as one of the reasons we chose this hotel was because of the pool and steam won t make that mistake again
