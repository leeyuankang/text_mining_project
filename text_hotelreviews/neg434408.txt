very confusing on booking com website saying that the hotel was yards from canning town station the nearest station is in fact royal victoria on the dlr this made our journey more stressful as we had an event to attend at we got off at canning town hoping to walk to the hotel to drop off stuff off and then get back on the jubilee line to north greenwich we called the hotel for directions who informed us they we need to get on the dlr to royal victoria and walk from there on a late friday afternoon in rush hour time we had to wait mins for trains as they were so busy we couldn t get on we finally arrived at the hotel and did not have time to get the dlr back to canning town and then change to jubilee line to north greenwich we got the emirates cable car over to the which was fantastic but was an additional unnecessary expense do not get off at canning town for this hotel get off at royal victoria
