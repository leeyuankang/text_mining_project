the fact i ve had to pay twice for the same room and still haven t had a refund for the first time i paid the hotel claim that because i booked the room on an older card before i had to pay again and they would refund my original card this hasn t been done i also paid extra for one of their valentine s packages i only got the rose petals on the bed but didn t see the chocolate platter we were meant to get or the room upgrade so i paid an extra for some roses unacceptable
