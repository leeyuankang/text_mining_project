i go to excel show every year thought to stay at this hotel as opposed to other internationally recognised hotels this year kettle did not work in the room iron scaled with no ironing board so had to iron on the floor scaled marked my beautiful silk blouse which will not come off the carpet throughout the room and halls stank of overuse hits you as you come out of the lift had to wait over hours for dinner to be served a party of four people at pm when only four tables were occupied with front of the house staff wondering around at the bar the barman told us they could not make one bloody mary because they were too busy when we joked but it is easy and quick to make this drink they highlighted a long winded process we ordered one at the end of the evening anyway no customer at the bar and it still took half an hour to come and tasted bland we did not make a fuss though and just had a laugh with the barman price included breakfast but when turned up to breakfast at am had to join a queue of people ahead all of us were told to sit down in the bar somewhere till they get some of their tables ready even though it was a buffet breakfast wont be staying there again i am afraid
