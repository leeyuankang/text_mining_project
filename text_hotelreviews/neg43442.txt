staff seemed to work as individuals and not as a team little bit chaotic at times breakfast never arrived in room as requested and had to chase the order in the morning no one answered from room service so had to go through the reception only to be passed on two more times before someone dealt with my issue when breakfast did arrive in room they only included one drink even though i specified persons booking out had to wait in a queue for minutes as only one person on front desk but when i finally requested more staff be called was helped by another very helpful female member of staff who dealt with us promptly and professionally
