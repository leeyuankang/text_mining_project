there are many catches to this hotel as they don t explain the extra charges and the main reception staff was quite rude and on top we requested a wake up call on both mornings and was told that there s nothing they can do about it as they don t have it written down which i feel is very bad customer service and was told no re fund which is stated on there company policy that a refund would be done due to the problem would be made which is their fault as their staff didn t communicate
