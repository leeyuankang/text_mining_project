restaurant and bar staff came across very rude we found the staff looked down on us as we were two younger girls much younger than most guests and felt that they gave the impression we didn t fit in when having a drink in the bar staff were very rude and demeaning staff during breakfast were constantly around giving us funny looks and seemed to pressure us to leave which didn t make it a relaxing and pleasurable experience
