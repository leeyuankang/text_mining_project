lighting in hotel room wasn t the best was very dark and had to turn on all the individual lights and then open the curtains which meant people in the building opposite were likely to have a nice view in the pool was smaller than i imagined and wasn t the warmest the jacuzzi was small and full of people so didn t get the use it there were separate saunas in each of the changing rooms which neither of used as we wanted to enjoy the experience together the changing rooms were small with no private changing areas so i got changed in the disabled toilet baby changing area as i felt uncomfortable about getting naked in front of people so that sense of luxury sort of dipped for me at that moment had to wait a bit for some of the breakfast options to come out as they ran out when i got there but sometimes that can t be helped
