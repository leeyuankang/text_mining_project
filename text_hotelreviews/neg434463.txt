problems with tv had to call reception times to resolve and restart tv only one out of two lifts working so constantly havinng to wait ages for it to come and hope there was space to get on breakfast time there was no one at the front desk to seat you and had to wait ages for certain items to be replaced checkout was far to long not enough staff to manage checkout there was a long line and checkout should be much more simple
