rooms were small and bed was very uncomfortable staff were lazy popped out to the shop late night and stood outside for over minutes in the cold ringing the bell had to call reception and ask them to open door car park was an additional which i thought was very expensive in your room i had not even a complimentary bottle of water in the fridge bathroom was so small both myself and partner could not brush our teeth at the same time i wanted a room with a shower as i have a bad leg but the gave me a room with bathtub and shower in the bath tub which is difficult for me to climb into very noisy the next morning which woke me and my partner before we were ready to get up due to maintenance work would not stay again absolute waste of for night people can see u on the pool from the main road this hotel should be a and a lot cheaper
