there was obviously work going on in the building which was extremely annoying loud drilling from about till about annoying when you just want to have a lay in but it won t be there all the time the breakfast however was poor and this is such a noticeable point because this isn t the first time i ve stayed at a crowne plaza hotel but this was mostly dry overcooked items of an english breakfast it was that bad sausages and bacon was okay though everything else was awful quality must improve here
