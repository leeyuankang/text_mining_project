hotel staff didn t appear to have a good command or understanding of english the receptionist argued that my debit credit card could not be used as a credit card when in fact it had been used as a credit card at hotel russell just a week prior when we first arrived in london for the first half of our stay had to request management to sort this out her attitude was non too friendly during this experience as mentioned before we stayed here during the first half our trip as well the movie which cost a staggering could not be enjoyed due to the poor satellite reception though the weather was near perfect room service the first night was acceptable however on night two the food was not delivered when i called to check on the reason i was told that it was after and therefore it could not be delivered the original order had been called in before as if this was not disappointing enough our reservations which i had made on line weeks before the trip was somehow bungled up and when we arrived on friday we were told the reservations were for saturday though i had an email confirmation of that friday being our arrival date we were able to get a room but then had to switch rooms the following morning as the room we were put in for one night was already reserved the location and appearance of the hotel was not enough to outweigh the overall negative experience of staying at hotel russell
