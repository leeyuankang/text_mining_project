check in was a long slow process check out was even worse one customer in front of me service in the bar was a joke it was not busy but again took a lot of waving to get served and then we were forgotten the free water in the room was not restocked over night i was left the drunk one from my first night when i went to use the mini bar there is a note inside saying please ask for this to be stocked if you need it defeating the object at when you need a cold glass of water or pop over priced hotel brand where customer service is low on the priority
