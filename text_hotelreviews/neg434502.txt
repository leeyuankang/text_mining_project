we were disappointed with service from the bar staff we wanted a coffee before retiring for the evening there were members of staff on duty all of which ignored us finally a man came over to where we re waiting and made a phone call rather than serve us a girl then asked what we wanted we replied two lattes please she told us the coffee machine was being cleaned and was therefore unable to make us a coffee we felt this was poor customer service
