our bedroom door couldn t lock on the inside we have told reception so this should be fixed asap in the spin dryer in the spa changing rooms there were nappies shoved in the dryer but this is a reflection of people who stayed there not the hotel also there is not much around this hotel but that was not a problem for us as we did find a very nice thai restaurant close by and we used the spa facilities at the hotel
