check in was a nightmare i got there and the chinese lady on the front desk told me she couldn t find my name i gave her an id and asked her to check again and she still couldn t find it then i gave her a booking com id which she said wouldn t help anyway she called booking com for me and after minutes on the line she suddenly found my name because i was already flustered from the whole experience i then gave her an old credit card which had expired which was then declined obviously she shouted on top of her voice your card has been declined sir there was definitely no need for that other hotels around the area cost less and have better customer service she gave us a back facing room and failed to mention the vouchers for breakfast at check in if you have a car park in the road at the back of the station it s free
