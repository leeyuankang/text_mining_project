i was not impressed with breakfast food was ok when it finally came out i like the variety and the quality was nice too i just found the atmosphere poor and very hectic the staff were dashing about which i do understand being busy but every single person that i asked for something at breakfast looked at me as if i was bothering them made me feel quite uncomfortable to ask for anything
