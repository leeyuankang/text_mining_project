the meal in the restaurant was good but the service was poor no one came to ask if we wanted dessert or if i wanted extra drinks and when i asked for the drinks menu i didn t get spoken to again until i asked for the bill at breakfast the staff were unhelpful and didn t relay the request fro poached eggs or pancakes to the chefs a special thanks to samantha who was working hard to clear plates away seat people and also sorted the order for us a side note to the breakfast if you want eggs benedict or florentine be prepared to pay a subsidy of as they do not come as part of the breakfast menu
