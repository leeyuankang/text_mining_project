ridiculous sum which is reserved on check in for any extras we arranged to have the minibar emptied prior to our visit attentiveness also lacking with special requests staff need to be trained in having eye contact with guests could go pass a well manned reception desk a couple of mornings with no contact with staff on return to hotel nobody acknowledged us either just felt impersonal no precence of senior management to give a little feedback such a pity as location facilities are great i ve served the hospitality industry for over years rarely have time ro take a family vacation so i am disappointed after paying a good rate
