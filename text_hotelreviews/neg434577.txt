large wedding and music could be heard all around the hotel until late or i fell asleep had a start to my sunday morning so maybe would be an issue should i want to stay in this area again i appreciate the hotel cannot help noisy guest returning to their rooms but being a wedding venue naturally allows this situation as i had an early start i was annoyed at myself for not considering and other hotels in the area appeared not to have this issue
