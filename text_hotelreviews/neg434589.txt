staff at the reception were below expectations welcoming was not friendly at all on saturday we called at midnight because of some loud noises other clients were making and they told us that they would look into it one hour later we had to go to reception because they hadn t solved anything and the solution was to hang in there because there was an ongoing party that was about to end also disappointed with the car service they didn t provide us with any info and when we had to pay to the driver instead of a closed price at the hotel we found out he didn t take credit so we had to run to the nearest atm
