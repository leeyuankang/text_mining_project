the pool facilities were not staffed there were several children jumping and diving into the pool even though a notice forbids plastic cups floated in the pool as kids had obtained them from a water machine this could have been easily solved by random checks by staff i reported this to the pool desk but the chap did not seem interested complained by email and still issues not accepted or addressed such a shame
