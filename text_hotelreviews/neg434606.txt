found lots of hairs in the bath when we checked in and dust on sides one pack of biscuits by the kettle so we shared them one each very nice though breakfast was very hectic we were not informed what we needed to do or how it worked eg help yourself but were deliver tea and coffee to table so was left to figure it out by asking others there was one brown sauce for the whole room that every time i got it it got whisked away and tomato sauce which were both empty no sweeteners for my tea needed to ask waiters and waited minutes to get some disappointed end to our holiday
