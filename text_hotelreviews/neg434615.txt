i booked myself and my three staff for a relaxing massage and mirning in the spa after our massages we went fuentes to enjoy the pool sauna jacuzzi and sauna but were unable to do so due to screaming crying babies having swimming lessons mothers singing nursery rhymes and generally total chaos it was the most unpleasant disappointing experience in a hotel i will never stay there again despite the fantastic location to the excel where we were exhibitors management were poor in their emai response stating that baby swimming lessons were displayed on their website if find is a total fob off and poor customer service for this reason i will refuce my entire hotel rating to zero out of ten the sign as you walk into the spa on the wall attached does not live up to its promise also a general service charge of is added to the bill in the resturant i asked a waiter if the tips were split fairly and was third they all get split at the end of the month the previous month the waiter received in total i refused to pay the service and tipped in cash how disgraceful to keep tips from your staff
