when booking room on this website i was given option to input any special requests for special occasions etc but this was not taken into consideration at all at the time of check in rather the focus of this encounter seemed to be to push the customer to pay to upgrade their room although good breakfast options were available only minimal variation from day to day view of carpark from window forced to upgrade to have any better view better upgrade offer from booking com than when checking in and told i was being given a special price not a smart tv so unable to cast or stream gym entrance was on floor and it was not possible to take lift directly up to your room but had to take lift down to ground floor and then back up again
