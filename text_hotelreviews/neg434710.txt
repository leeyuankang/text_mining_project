very noisy hardly slept at all such a shame as room and staff were great no protection from people talking outside of the hotels until the early hours we didn t go to bed early either and there were people talking and laughing loudly at the lift shaft all through the night but never for long enough for us to be able to complain to reception not the staffs fault they were great but we wouldn t risk staying there again
