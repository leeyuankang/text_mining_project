hotel doesn t offer twin bedded rooms with disabled access walk in shower as per my request very annoyed to not find this out until we checked in as it was late and the room was paid for in advance of our stay we compromised with a king size bed with separate duvets as one of my problems is not being able to sleep with my lower legs and feet covered
