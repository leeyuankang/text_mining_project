the reason we wanted to go was to use the spa and relax in the pool but with children s swimming lessons from and both saturday and sunday it was difficult screaming kids is not easy to relax to the wait for breakfast on the sunday was awkward so many people were sitting in the waiting area to go through but the organisation of the maitre d was astonishing she crossed of numbers of the rooms but was then asking who was next to come through to the restaurant never seen anything like it and ive ran a few bars and restaurants in my time
