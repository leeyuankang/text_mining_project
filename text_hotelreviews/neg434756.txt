i didn t like the staff that i spoke to they were rude and very unhelpful as i was given false information at the beginning of my trip about payments i had supposedly made i was then phoned at very early in the morning to be told that i had to pay the payments being unaware of this the night before i had taken the little cash i had left in my account and spent some that day and night i didn t have enough money in my account to pay for the nights off my card or in cash as i had spent money before as i went out for a planned meal i had trust and faith in the staff as i should that they had taken the payment out of my account so i didn t check my bank account after i bought this matter up with the manager she told me it was my fault and that i would no longer be able to stay meaning that my whole trip to london was ruined and i couldn t stay in the location i wanted due to other hotels near by being full i was very upset and disappointed by the lack of respect i was shown and the i don t care attitude i got from the manager what happened to the customers always right
