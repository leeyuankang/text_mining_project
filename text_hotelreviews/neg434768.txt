the spa did not feel very welcomed on arrival in the spa really should have a lifeguard for supervision as lots of children jumping in and making it very difficult to actually swim being months pregnant i was looking for a relaxing swim but this was not possible i also found the facilities within the spa more like a leisure centre than that of a four star hotel dissapointing
