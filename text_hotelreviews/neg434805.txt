having checked into our room we found it to have no heating on the coldest weekend of the winter so far our teenage son was in the room next door ad also had no heating we were told that if we wanted to move rooms that they would be on different floors we wanted to stay together so we were given portable heaters these subsiquently blew the fuses in our room and once again we had to call somebody up by this time it was and we hadn t got to bed the following morning we were without hot water we stayed for nights with only portable heaters however hot water was restored the staff were very pleasant but we wern t so much as offered a drink for our inconvenience on top of that my son left a set of headphones in the room which were very promptly returned to us be special delivery for which of course we were very grateful but it would have been a nice gesture not to charge us for the postage they had many opportunities to win us around and none were taken i think next year when we take our anual trip to the boat show we might try a different hotel
