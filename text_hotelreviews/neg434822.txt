the only thing that was abit annoying was the jacuzzi had alot of chlorine init and when myself and other guests approached the receptionist on duty she didn t do anything and said it was fine only shortly later when i had to get out because i was choking and couldn t breathe that s when something was done it did make me very ill later that day
