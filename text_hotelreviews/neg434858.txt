at check in i felt the person checking me in was checking that i was who i said i was it was uncomfortable all other staff were great his manner was a bit odd for the front desk he wasn t unhelpful just a bit off first given a room on the floor which was musty it was changed but not without the same man trying a hard sell on charging me half price for an upgrade on that floor i didn t like that after hours travelling and just wanting to eat and sleep he told me there was just pizza and ham and cheese toastie available but when i went to order from the room there was also chicken tikka my experience would have been better if i had never encountered him
