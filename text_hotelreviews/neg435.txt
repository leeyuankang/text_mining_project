we needed gluten free breakfast and ordered it beforehand but the serving was not safe the toasts were but nothing else not the table was set up in the way that cross contamination was difficult to avoid also bacon eggs and potato cakes were cooked in the same oven and served together potato cakes had gluten including flours they seemed to have no idea what exactly it all means to serve safe gluten free food
