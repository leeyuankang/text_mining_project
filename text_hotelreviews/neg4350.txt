they offered us an upgrade which i paid for as it was my birthday and i thought my wife would like it there but rather than an improvement the the room was the worst ive had there and i have stayed a good number of times the bathroom was in a shocking state the main air conditioning unit was right out side the window so we couldn t have the window open all in all as great disappointment
