we had a room which was directly above the bar and we could hear the bass of the music however we were able to call down and they turned the music off and if guests were being too loud the staff asked them to lower their voices the hotel staff offered us another room but we were happy with the room and didn t move the staff were so helpful and we were very grateful for their efforts
