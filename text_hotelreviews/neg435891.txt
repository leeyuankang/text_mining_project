i asked for non allergenic pillow s when i arrived and discovered the pillows are goose or duck feathers nothing ever came of my request they didn t get back to me and no pillows showed up also the breakfast room is far too small for the size of the hotel and amount of guests the hotel seems to have quite a few rooms that have no view at all and look out into the center of the building but it was quiet so that makes up for it to some extent
