we were given what i would describe as someone s flat that they let us have for the weekend it had two separate bathrooms one with a shower the other with a bath the sink in the bath bathroom did not work the staff basically said oh well the room had scuffs on the walls the carpet needed replacing and the bathrooms were obviously in disrepair the room was supposed to be of modern design but fell flat they should embrace the history of the hotel and reflect that in their rooms and service
