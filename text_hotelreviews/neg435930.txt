the room was very small with no place to put a toiletry bag anywhere also the bathroom smelled of stale urine mixed with cigarette smoke if it had not been for the smell of the room and the window it would have been a great hotel there were complimentary bottles of water which is always appreciated our room on the floor looked like it could have been an attic with a window that was one could not look out of as it was really high up in roof of the room very unpleasant luckily i was there for only one night
