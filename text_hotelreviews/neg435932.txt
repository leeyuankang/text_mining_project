the hotel itself is old without modern furnitures the room temperature is always high which makes the room without fresh air i booked executive room but there s no balcony comparing to other executive rooms also the bathroom is so small that the water from the shower is easily flowing to the outside overall it is not worthy to pay for staying one night
