had stayed at the hotel a few years ago had a beautiful large room very disappointed with my return visit at for our night stay i didn t expect to get the smallest hotel room i have ever been in was amazed that they managed to shoehorn a bathroom into the space they had there was a bath too i am only feet tall and i couldn t lie down in the bath a good shower stall would have made much more sense the bed was comfortable everything looked pretty shabby the windows were very dirty didn t matter that much the only view we had was of a white tiled dirty wall will not return here
