i sure wish that i had known the radisson airport is also called radisson blu everything i saw only showed radisson airport and then radisson blu was the downtown hotel well we were told to take the free airport shuttle to get to the radisson blu hotel we waited nearly minutes after an exhausting flight took it and when we got off i knew immediately were in the wrong place of course the two hotels don t coordinate when this happens and apparently it happens often so we then had to pay a euro taxi ride to get to our hotel ridiculous our first few hours in amsterdam was a mess because of this it should be made obvious that both hotels are called radisson blu
