we didn t like arriving to find that our requested early check in wasn t available and that the room they did have planned for us was facing an alley they offered to upgrade us at a cost of more per day but that included breakfast we agreed although we didn t want to pay that much and then found we had to still wait two hours after waiting the two hours the room was not available and we took the original room at the original price only to find out that the alley was not an alley but a small side walking street the room was nice but we are seniors and having to go three steps up and down from the closet and bathroom to the bed without warning was not nice i don t blame the hotel as much as the peson who checked us in as not being knowledgeable nor trying to meet our needs overall however we had a nice stay enjoyed the location the restaurant for dinner was wonderful with a fabulous waitress even with the negative comments i would stay there again but choose my room differently
