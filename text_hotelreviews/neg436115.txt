although it was a nice hotel clean etc i believe it was a little expensive for what it was our booking did not include breakfast and we decided against adding it on as it was an extra eur per person it was much cheaper to visit one of the many cafes in the centre we only stayed at the radisson as it was a special birthday trip and wanted that little extra luxury
