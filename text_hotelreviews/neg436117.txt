our recent stay at the radisson blu in amsterdam was the most maddening experience i have ever had involving unprofessional and poorly trained hotel staff especially at a supposedly high end property like radisson blu the entire hotel staff has seemingly great difficulty with the concept of finding a way to communicate with a guest that doesn t involve insulting them deactivating their key cards or accusing them of financial improprieties the front desk staff made an error and lost our check in data claiming they needed to speak with us they skipped right past slipping a note under the door or flashing the message light on the room phone instead they intentionally deactivated our key cards so that we had to come find them the desk staff and a trainee manager then made the situation worse with a cavalier attitude and no acknowledgement that we had been inconvenienced or the validity of our concerns about the potentially compromised credit card information they also claimed that no other manager was available until the next day when we would be checking out i drafted an e mail to an assistant manager the only contact information they would provide he then poured fuel on the fire by criticizing me for leaving the hotel without speaking to him we were in taxi to the airport before he arrived at the hotel slandering me by suggesting that our early departure am was somehow an effort to avoid payment and then inexplicably introducing sexism misogyny into the mix by trivializing the conduct of the two ladies we had first dealt with the hotel location is excellent and the rooms are quite nice except that many of their business class rooms are in an annex building that is only accessible with two elevator rides and a walk through an underground corridor that depending on time of day can be a gauntlet of tables and or cocktail imbibing convention goers
