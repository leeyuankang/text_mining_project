we ate in the restaurant on the first night and both the service and the food were poor it took ages to get served we had long waits for drinks between courses and food items arrived at random so that we couldn t eat at the same time and the whole service felt chaotic some dishes were ok but my halibut was woefully over cooked and under seasoned it was a big disappointment they also don t have enough space for breakfast often there is a wait for a table and one particularly busy morning we ended up in the overflow space downstairs which was a chilly charmless function room that didn t have all the food in the main breakfast area not recommended
