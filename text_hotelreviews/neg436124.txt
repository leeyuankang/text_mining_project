on three of the four mornings someone from housekeeping either knocked on the door or used their key to try to come in before while we were either still in bed or getting dressed we found this very annoying something needs tightening up there the previous time we stayed christmas reception was in the other building and there were always apples and biscuits for guests at reception and free coffee tea in the lounge near the door all these little extras seem to have disappeared now that the renovation is complete would it really cost so much to provide them again
