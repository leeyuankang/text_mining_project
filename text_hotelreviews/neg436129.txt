bathrooms too small and showers poor the decor in the rooms felt dated and the rooms were dark everything was over priced especially the food and breakfast which was very average for a hotel this fell well short furthermore i booked this hotel by mistake on booking com along with others the other four which were small independent hotels were prepared to refund me my booking and the radisson was the only one that refused very poor for such a large chain who clearly could have resold the room immediately
