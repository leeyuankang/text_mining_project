when we first arrived we were told we had to pay in full before receiving the room and a euro deposit upfront for the room the price of the room was also after rising when we arrived and i was very disappointed with the way we were told i had a booking confirmation with the total price and they told us it was wrong and charged an extra i enjoyed the location and hotel itself but the value for money and the way the staff treated us was not worth it i m very disappointed and i think it was extrememely unreasonable to ask us to pay before even seeing the room and the ridiculous deposit on top of that also it disrupted our entire weekend we were out of pocket for our break and had to adjust our daily budget which was a big inconvenience
