minor downs junior suite room s windows leak but they could remotely crank up the heating i had to tap the gaps with towels sound isolation wasn t ideal u could hear people clearly on the corridors though most of staff are nice one women told me to remember to return the umbrella the moment i was going to borrow it for the sudden rain and i just need it to load my luggages onto a taxi outside the gate maybe they have had umbrellas stolen before or maybe it s a dutch thing in my opinion it is rude to say that to a customer or maybe anyone also at least she could have said please
