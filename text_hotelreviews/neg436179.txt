a few things that did not ruin our stay at all or make us not go back but a few pointers the main problem was asking for a king sized bed when we go their they explained that their was two separated and will be put together tomorrow done as said but two separate quilts on our king size became a pain in the bum throughout the evenings next door was very loud the deposit was alot of money and we didnt know until we turned up so make sure you prepare a deposit for some reason i hated the carpet with a passion but thats me being fussy but this did not effect our stay to much at all
