the main building of the hotel where the entrance is the breakfast is taken and the majority of the rooms are is not the one shown in the pictures but a relatively new building in the same street the room that we stayed in a superior room was nothing special the decoration was a little bit kitsch plates hanging on the wall kitsch carpet many lamps and the bathroom though renovated seemed quite old fashioned i do not know whether all rooms are the same because to my understanding the hotel is a combination of several buildings as far as the breakfast is concerned i did not like that much the omelettes and the scramble eggs they were not tasty
