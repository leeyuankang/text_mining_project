when i arrived they provisionally charged my credit card for more than eur two rooms following day they charge the final rate eur on my credit card but they did not cancel the provisional rates this provisional rate remains on my credit card for days which is more than ridiculous many hotels actually do the same trick and i am extremely annoyed about this bad and stupid behaviour car rental companies on the other hand really cancel the provisional excess charge immediately once the car has been returned successfully why hotels can t do the same i complain about this problem now for more than years without any improvement
