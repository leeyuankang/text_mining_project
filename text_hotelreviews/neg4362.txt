the room was pure value for money i booked a double deluxe room but nothing about the room was luxurious it was small poor decorated the bed was on wheels one of the lightbulbs on the ceiling was hanging out of the socket and the toilet roll holder was broken i expect much better than this for a room that costs more than per night
