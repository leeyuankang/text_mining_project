upon our arrival we discovered that the room was prepared for adults while we were adults and kids asked for the additional beds but only one was available on top of that a wooden hatch fell from the wall and hit my wife luckily without major injuries the management of the hotel offered us a dinner as a compensation but we have had to pay for the drinks it s enough to say so definitely not a suggested choice an unsafe place with ridiculous management
