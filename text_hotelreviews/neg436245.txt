there was a bad smell in the breakfast area that you can t not notice during all days of our stay as well as the cups smelled very bad the options of the breakfast could be wider by adding some mediteranian options one more thing that i don t like about radisson blu chain is the late check in at pm but this is not the fault of this hotel but the chain in general definitely i would stay here again but please improve the breakfast
