the male front desk staff were generally arrogant and gave poor recommendations for places to eat or shop worst concierge service i ve ever had the women were friendlier but not especially knowledgeable either i expected better of a place like this the bed was hard and sheets were rough i don t mind a firm mattress but this needed a topper or something between mattress and sheet as i could feel the quilted mattress surface through the sheet all pillow types on menu were pretty soft even the firm one seemed very expensive for what was a pretty ordinary level of comfort overall they could be friendlier more knowledgeable about the local area and make a couple of small changes to the bedding to improve things
