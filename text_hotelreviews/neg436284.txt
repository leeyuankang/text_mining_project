we asked for early check in since we were traveling with my years old mother no room was available when we arrived to the hotel at well this is acceptable because they did not guarantee it the unacceptable happenings began when we came back to check in we got our keys and went to the room the keys did not open the room back to the reception and they handled the keys and again the room is not opened same thing the third time but this time when we tried the key someone opened the door there was a guest in the room that they gave us back to the reception a lot of apologize and they gave us another room we were very surprised to see that the room junior suite had steep staircase to get into it nowhere in the room description this stairs were mentioned we emphasized in our reservation that one of our party is years old where is the common sence to give us such a room when we told the staff that it is not exceptable the only other option that we were given for a room for was another room very very far away from the elevators again not suitable for our elderly mother we had to compromise for the room with the stairs my mother did not get out of the room until the next morning in order to avoid the stairs very very disappointing from hotel in this level and price
