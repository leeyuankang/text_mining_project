breakfast format doesn t work very well the staff are great but there weren t enough staff or the process of getting you sat down taking orders for tea and coffee or any egg omelette orders were very slow and could be much better you wait a while for fresh eggs but then queue to add any other items in which case the freshly made stuff is then cold the quality and variety was fine but needs a re think could be much better
