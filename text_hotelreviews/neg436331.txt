the food in the hotel was very pricey and in my opinion over priced for what was on offer also the radisson automatically deducted a charity donation i have no problem donating to the charity however given i gave the radisson over for a three night stay i think they could match the donation and give something themselves perhaps they do but i did not see this stated anywhere as with many hotels the hairdryer was very poor and situated in the bathroom no mirror in the room at the dressing table to do makeup and use straighteners
