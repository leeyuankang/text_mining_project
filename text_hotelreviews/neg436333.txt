where to start upon arrival we asked for euro deposit i have never paid a deposit at a hotel and have travelled to amsterdam many times i was not advised of this in advance and felt it was a lot of money to request without prior notice or valid reasoning the facilities in the room were non existent and there was no mirror in the room in this day and age of hair straighteners etc to no have a mirror in the room is ludicrous the shower was clued in place i am over and had to crouch down and lean against a wall to be able to shower and wash my hair the tv in the room had a great feature where every minutes it would switch to the hotel advertising telling me about all the wonderful facilities i would be refused we were given a welcome pack advising we could borrow an umbrella if it was going to rain so we asked to borrow one as the forecast showed a downpour of rain expected to last hours despite the advertising and welcome pack offering this service we were refused this service as this hotels staff are apparently trained to forecast weather and we were assured it would not rain minutes after leaving the hotel the skies opened up and we were drenched and had to buy an umbrella thank you for that i travel about a lot i have stayed in all types of accommodation from hostels to suites in hotels and never have i been so pleased to check out of a hotel i travel to amsterdam frequently for work and leisure never would i recommend this hotel to anyone who wanted to enjoy their trip i do not feel i had value for money from my stay and if i had paid by credit card i would be asking my credit card company to reverse the transaction as i do believe i got what i paid for and expected staying in a hotel
