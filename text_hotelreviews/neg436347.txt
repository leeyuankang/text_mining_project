didn t like the room the view onto the back of the hotel was awful and noisy there was a lot of noise till about o clock in the morning the room was the most uncomfortable i have stayed in of that standard there was nowhere to put makeup on as the lighting was bad in the bathroom and the bedroom was so dark there was no mirror in the bedroom the safe was on such a high shelf i couldn t reach inside i m even my husband had to stand on a chair to see inside the safe he s there were only shelves to put clothes in which meant you had to pull everything out to see what you wanted obviously not designed with a woman s needs in mind
