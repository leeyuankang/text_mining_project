the carpet was not clean and the floor in the bathroom was with spots on it it was very hard to flush the toilet elevators were very slow and one of the two was not working for two days the staff closed my room twice because they thought they did not have the right papers although i had given a credid card as i checked in the first time because they had not taken the voucher as i checked in i had it in my safe and had not been asked for it as i came the second time because i had the last night in a separate booking but i had told the lady at the check in about that in all i think the staff could have been more attentive and nice
