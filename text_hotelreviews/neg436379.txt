rooms felt quite cold each evening on arrival we were asked to authorise money incase of damage to the room or usage of a minibar that was in our room that was fine come the sunday when checking out we where then told we got charged for each day we used the minibar not just so for the drinks we had out the minibar each day we were charged a further which i wasn t happy about as this wasn t something that was explained when booking or on arrival nor wer we told that the fridge was sensored or you were charged for each item removed this wasn t something that was made clear i also don t like the fact that they have your details on the system from when you book the hotel as i was asked to show my card and passport for id and authorisation again and didn t have to imput my pin each time however the overall experience was good very nice modern hotel and is in a really good place to the red light and a lot of shops only about walk from the city centre the train station and about minutes walk to the icebar all in all a good stay
