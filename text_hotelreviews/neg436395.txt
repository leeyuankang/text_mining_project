we didn t get a bath although we had booked a superior room with a bath were offered an alternative room the following day so had to move our room wasn t cleaned until we rang and asked at about and were told that rooms weren t cleaned unless requested having voiced our complaints i didn t feel that they took us seriously the complimentary fruit cocktail offered as a gesture was truly horrible and undrinkable
