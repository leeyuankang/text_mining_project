the worst experience of hotel that i ve ever had i ve been coughing all the time as long as i m in the room i m totally fine when i m out of the hotel the bedding is not clean and air in the room is bad the staff is not helpful at all i told them about what i had been through they only told me that they was not able to do anything now and asked me why not tell them earlier well i didn t know it was the bedding in the first place i stayed there for two nights and every time when i got back to hotel it was late already i didn t even think about it was the bedding problem they definitely owe me an apology
