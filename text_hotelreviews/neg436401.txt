not much to be honest the place is pricey but the premium you pay is worth it for the quiet and superior staff experience if i had one issue it would be a small one the bathrooms and showers are quite poor freezing cold floors and low pressure showers only a minor issue though i guess the other problem i had was the same as about of the other hotels i ve stayed at water i don t think hotels realize how much good will they can generate by providing a small bottle of water for free instead of making me pay for a small bottle from the mini bar they made in total from me from that but it cost them a perfect score they get everything else right though
