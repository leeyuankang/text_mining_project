we did not like only room service menu is very poor only option is club sandwich and burger that i can say it service is very very slow once we order a club sandwich and raddison blu burger and it took mins to deliver to the room and also burger was too cold and we paid for it and did not enjoy with the food at all please improve your room service quality
