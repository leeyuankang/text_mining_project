i found the staff on reception to be particularly rude i called reception to ask when my laundry would be collected the lady on the phone asked me if i had asked them to collect it and i said that when checking in i did mention that i had some that needed doing the lady on the phone was very patronizing and blamed me for my laundry not being collected she then sent someone to collect my laundry twelve items of which most were socks and they charged me more than my actual stay there upon checking out i raised a small criticism with them and the reaction i got was basically a laugh i have stayed in many radissons but never experienced that the hotel itself is excellent very comfortable but they need to work on their actual hospitality
