the room was very cold we tried to set the temperature higher but heating worked only temporarily so we had to call couple of times to get the engineer in and he said that their system is set to a lower temperature by default and that he will set it higher our friends had to spend the same hour to figure heating with the engineer for their room staff had a lot of attitude and polite requests for early check in or heat adjustment were declined without any effort to accommodate concierge could not recommend any good set of restaurants instead pointed to the area on the map and suggested that find one ourselves overall reception service not something i would expect from the hotel of this class room was facing the street and was a bit noisy from the regular street noise as windows are old
