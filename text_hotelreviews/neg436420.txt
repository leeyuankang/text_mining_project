we arrived at the hotel about on wed i was appalled by the attitude of the manager when i kindly asked why we had to pay euros deposit for our stay and why this was not stated in our agreement his answer was if you don t like it go find somewhere else i was so upset and angry it was late and we was tired from the travelling hotel was lovely and clean and a really good location real shame about the staff would never recommend this hotel to any friends or family
