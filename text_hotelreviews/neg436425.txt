the radisson promises a comfortable stay yet there was building work going on from m where the workers were hammering banging calling out to each other all of which took place right below our bedroom window in a square in the middle of the hotel so the noise echoed and bounced off the wall we only stayed nights and the first i managed to fall back to sleep but the i had to get up because at the repetitive hammering was too much i checked the website on my return and did not find anything indicating that my room would be less than super comfortable which was not the case when you are staying for work or leisure you want a good nights sleep so you can have energy in the day and it affected my energy levels a lot below there is a suggestion i post a photo of my room view and i only wish now i had photographed the works going on and the men shouting across and hammering before the day was up
