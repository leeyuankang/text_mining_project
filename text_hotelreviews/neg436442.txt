maybe shud give more advise of how to walk from train station or which tram station before guests arrive cause it took us over hour to find the hotel paid n waited for tram n got out of the wrong stop n hunted for another hour if the instruction is clear it ll only take me minutes to walk from train station with my luggage the construction work starts too early n really noisy in the morning before our morning call time
