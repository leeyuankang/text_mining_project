for the first night we had a wonderful room with a huge bed and tv but in the early morning we were waken up around am because of the noise from construction works i called to reception they said that they are sorry and they stopped it for a while then it started again and with new power after that our room was changed but i was not in the hotel till the late evening and when i came i found out that our new room is smaller and the bed smaller too as well as it had shower instead of a bathtube and old tv and when i called them again i was told that our room was upgraded to business though it s worth than a regular one in the end they didn t change me a room saying that they have only rooms with twin beds left so we were not satisfied with our stay at all
