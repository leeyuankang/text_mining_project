two weeks before arival we made an upgrade to a room with breakfast included but this was not communicated to the staff at the breakfast desk no problem the first morning this was resolved with a call at the reception annoying that we had to repeat this on the second morning when the staff again had no knowledge about the upgrade and we again had to wait until this was clarified bad internal communication
