despite having requested early check in via e mail and after flying all night and arriving at the hotel we were made to wait until pm sleeping in the lobby supposedly because the hotel had been full the previous night once we finally got in the room dead tired the carpet had not even been vacuumed and there were other minor things not ready while we were waiting to check in we had checked our luggage with the porter when we went to pick it up the porter could not find our bags and he took us to where checked bags were stored in a stack out in the open of a parking garage open to the street we booked and paid for a suite which by definition should be two rooms but the room was really just one room with a revolving tv at the end of the bed apparently to divide the room entering the room especially with luggage we took our own since everything in this hotel took forever to get done was hazardous upon entry there were immediate sidewinder steps down into the room there was a large dangerous unlit step up into the bathroom which only had one sink for the entire suite the room was small with little walking area to be brief the liquor at the bar and restaurant was automatically metered and the drinks were expensive and weak there was a larger building across the street from the lobby also part of the hotel which looked better than where we were placed in essence i have stayed at many radisson blu brand hotels and this one simply did not measure up
