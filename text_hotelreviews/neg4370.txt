the staff were very unfriendly in both the reception area and the restaurant we booked a twin room for our night stay and when we checked in there was no twin room available and we had to take small single rooms no apology i emailed times about my booking no response i rang the hotel times as my flight was delayed no answer we paid for the room on check in and when we went to check out they insisted that we didn t pay and had to find the card receipt to prove we had paid when we gave it to the receptionist we got no apology again and were not asked if we enjoyed our stay i would not stay at this hotel again
