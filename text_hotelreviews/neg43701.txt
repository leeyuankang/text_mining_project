room and in particular the bathroom very small other reviews said this was standard for paris though given new towels each day but they left the old towels in the room on the second day when cleaned only french channels on the tv we hardly had time to put it on but just seems odd not to even offer any international news stations bathroom had a really horrid smell when we arrived and the tiling looked a little dirty in the shower overpriced breakfast for what it was so we didn t bother just felt like we paid for a star hotel but got a nice star
