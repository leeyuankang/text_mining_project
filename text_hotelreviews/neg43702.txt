parking was very far away through a maze of streets we almost got lost practically at the next metro station to the one closest to the hotel in a public covered car park not on site or adjacent to the hotel as we were made to believe also it cost euros per day breakfast was not included in the room rate and it cost euros per person the choice of food was very basic we estimated that the breakfast room can only accommodate at most people although on the first day we were the only ones there and on the second only one other couple was there this probably was a reflection of what other guests think of the value of this service there was a large tv with numerous channels but nothing in english except cnn didn t even bother to watch it after the initial channel surfing with the remote control
