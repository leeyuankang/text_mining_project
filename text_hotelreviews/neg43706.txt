when we checked out we were asked if we had taken something from mini bar in our room we didn t even touch anything there and we said it so we paid for the room left our bags at the reception and went out to have the last dinner in paris when we came back to pick up the bags we were said that the cleaning staff had found an empty bottle of juice or whatever it was i have no idea and it meant that we had drunk the juice and had to pay for it so emm euros is not a problem especially taking in account the fact that we got the room really cheap but it s weird to feel like a thief guys if i had taken something from your mini bar i would definitely have told you about it and paid for it at once so now i don t know if it was just a mistake or the staff maybe only the cleaning staff did it intentionally anyway it really spoiled our impression
