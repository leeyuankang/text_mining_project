my room was rather dark and although i wasn t going to spend much time in it i would have appreciated more natural light also whilst the breakfasts were very good the layout in the restaurant made it very difficult when busy but there s not a lot they can do to rectify this therefore anyone planning to stay there should aim for either an early or late breakfast and avoid the peak time
