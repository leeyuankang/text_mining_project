we needed beds but my teenage son and i arrived late and had to share one for the first night i would advise calling ahead to fix this the staff were friendly and attentively met are needs by changing our room to a bed room the next day and we were not used to a bathroom with a frosted glass door the first room had the toilet in front of the door so we could see each other on the pot my son fixed this by draping the bed runner over the door the second room was ok as is fans in the bathroom would be nice too since they don t have windows to the outside
