the hotel is of very poor level of security one morning on feb two friends of mine had breakfast in the breakfast room and during the time they were having breakfast there was nobody in the room except for staff when they finished the breakfast and about to leave the room they discovered the bag storing all personal items valued at were stolen it was really like a movie as tourists first time being the city we asked hotel staff to check however they refused to have any collaboration and directed us to the local police who has not unveiled any investigation results so far we can attach our report of the case to the police the hotel has not taken neither official apology nor actively informed us any result found it was really disappointing experience living in this hotel
