the room was quite dark and the view was poor as we only could see the kitchen ventilators the comfort level was inadequate as there was no air conditioning working i asked for a fan at the service desk but there was none available in the hotel also i tried to book a meal via email prior to arriving but confirmation was not given that the booking had been made when approached about the meal we were quite upset when the chef starting raising his voice at the service desk member of staff when we explained that we didn t attend the meal as no confirmation had been given yet we were still charged for the meal we didn t eat we left a day early than our stay
