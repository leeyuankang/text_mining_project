the staff was very rude there is a male concierge who was disrespectful to us i think his name is sergio or something like that i asked him several times to call a taxi and he refused every time the room was super dirty we found someone else s sock in our bed the windows were not opening we put a book in between the window and wall to have a little bit of air and in the morning the cleaning staff closed it because he was washing the window he couldn t care less that we were sleeping he just wanted to clean that bloody window i complained about the noise the room and the staff so we received some fruits and a bottle of water we ate fruits i think and one of the staff complained to us that we didn t eat them anyways the place is very far from the city center so don t let yourselves fooled because it s not exactly what it looks like don t recommend it
