unfortinately the room wasn t ready upon our arrival we had to wait between and pm to have access to it the staff apologised but that wasn t good enough as it changed the planning of our day the second day when we went back after lunch just after pm the room had not been done yet the explanation being that we hadn t told the reception about our intention of returning to the room at that time
