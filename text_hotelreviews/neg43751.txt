when i arrived at the hotel i was told that my room was not ready and that i needed to return at pm which i did however when i arrived after pm i was told that it still wasn t ready and that i needed to continue to wait the staff wasn t particularly about the annoyance and inconvenience caused offering only a drink as by way of an apology the rooms are rather small we had a twin bed room and there was not much space once we had pulled the beds apart in addition i think a rating is overrating it a bit i would say that it is a good standard
