they were painting the hallways in the am the repairman did his best to open door to vent fumes but you could smell the paint anyhow that sort of repair to the immediate access to premises if ongoing during a guest stay should be something the hotel notifies you of in advance of your reservation or at check in the building w the suites which is separate from main hotel doesn t have staff watching the doors and the front door remained propped open perhaps it wasn t a security concern for them but i walked in the front door seemingly undetected unless the entrance was being monitored by security camera that i didn t see so that raised an eyebrow from me
