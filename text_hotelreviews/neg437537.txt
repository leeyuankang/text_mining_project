the two recommendations for dinner were not great one very expensive and ok and the other recommended for the paella was not so great the hotel breakfast is very pricey so we opted to eat in the neighborhood the location is very challenging the taxi driver did not know where it was and dropped us off at a nearby main street which required us to lug three pieces of luggage and a guitar through a rabbit warren of winding narrow streets until we found the hotel they do suggest a pickup transport from the airport but it cost euros
