directions were very hard to come by as we walked from a public parking area to the hotel even the taxis don t reliably know where it is when given the address the hotel could do a better job of providing directions frankly for the same cost or even less i have stayed in other places in major cities and other relais et chateaus sites that offered more amenities and more luxurious rooms
