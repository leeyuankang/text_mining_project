sometimes i felt communication problems led to misunderstanding but the staff were excellent and very helpful the towelling robes were a bit worn and as it was expensive i felt there were no little luxuries to make me feel indulged also there was no real lounge to sit in or really a bar as such except attached to the restaurant which seemed empty most of the time but obviously got busy in the evening the views from the bedroom were nil as the curtains had to be closed the whole time as the balconies opposite were just feet away
