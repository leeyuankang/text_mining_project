travellers should be aware that this is an inner and ancient city location so the streets are very narrow taxis have trouble but the walk to the square isn t long and the neighbours very close so no big views light sleepers should also note that small cobbled streets equal a bit of noise with late night revellers and early morning deliveries although the windows do damp a lot of it
