unfortunately if you are there for a while over a week there was only three drawers and a small wardrobe space to put clothes in take hangers if u can but we were there only for a few days so didn t matter to us if you are going to mount tibadabo just pay to go up the finicular dont get park tickets until u have seen what rides there are if there is just adults then u wont want to go in the park you can still go in the church that is up there without a park ticket
