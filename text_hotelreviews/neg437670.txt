very unfriendly and arrogant behaviour of staff during check in staff especially the hotel manager arrogantly escalated a small problem that could be solved in a friendly way and after check in definitely unprofessional attitude to the guests the rooms are nice and clean but unfortunately due to poor sewage system infested with a strong bad smell on request the room was without any problems replaced but the strong odour of sewerage was also there according to the staff approach to this this problem the hotel knows about the sewer smell for this reason the price does not correspond to quality of the accommodation
