the staff could not fix some issues in the room we had a problem with the safe cleaning was not so great and we had to request they clean the room twice despite being out of the hotel most of the day they also did not refill the basic things we needed in the room the telepizza food order service was really in very bad taste and not on par with the hotel vibe and internal food service they could use some internal room food service there is no view of anything from the hotel it is literally staring into adjacent offices from the window everything great in barcelona is about a from the hotel which is a plus and minus
