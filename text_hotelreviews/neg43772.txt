from the website it showed that we were getting a reduction and that the room was originally chf and the reduced price was chf however the room was quite a dissappointment and hard to imagine that it would originally cost chf as the size of the room and even quality does not match the price at all we thought we were getting a good offer but it didn t seem like it as i am positive the room we stayed in does not cost chf per day i am even wondering if this is a methodology used by the hotel to get customers to book the hotel overall i did not get what i expect and would not stay there again
