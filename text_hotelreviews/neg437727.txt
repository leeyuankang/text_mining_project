i left my coat in the room by mistake when checking out and when i got back it had gone i know this was my own fault but your staff whilst doing what was required of them indicated that i must have left it somewhere else an acknowledgement that it might be found at a later stage and i would be notified would have made it a nicer experience i am usually very careful but because of this experience i would not return to your hotel nor would i recommend it to anyone in the future
