fridge was not usable due to excess ice that was not checked and cleaned by house keeping but i guess this is an isolated incident though should not happen you really need to re check the rate again hours before you arrive so that you could cancel and re book the same apartment again at a better rate in my case it went down by eur per night but they refused to give me the new rate on the day so i was penalised euro in two nights stay for early booking
