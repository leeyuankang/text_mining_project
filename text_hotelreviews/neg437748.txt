a couple of points each room has a doorbell or buzzer which the cleaners ring when wanting to enter a room the buzzers are quite loud and we were woken up both mornings by our neighbour s buzzer i initially thought it was ours not an issue if you re already up bright and early but we wanted to lie in and rest till late morning which was not possible despite having the do not disturb sign on the cleaners still entered the room to make the bed replace the towels and tidy up the room this has never happened to us before so we were a bit surprised had we wanted our room to be cleaned we would have displayed the please clean my room side of the sign but when staying for only two nights i do not see this necessary we raised both issues with the staff at checkout and they were very apologetic
