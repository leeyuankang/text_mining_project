we have stayed in fraser properties in multiple locations around the world we were very pleased with our previous stays but the stay in this barcelona property was so disappointing it is definitely not up to the fraser standard we had a one bedroom apartment the sofa bed on a spring base had a very thin mattress it was so uncomfortable that it caused my daughter to have a backache pillows provided was thin and this caused a neck ache the sewer smell from the toilet was horrid the shower tray is rather slippery a situation where diasaster is waiting to happen the pedal bin did not have a lid and obviously it had one before we are surprised that fraser allowed the continued use of a broken bin in the room we originally intended to stay for nights but after the nights which were pre booked we left totally disappointed the house keeping of the room was shoddy floor mat for the toilet was not given used mugs were left in the pantry sink the housekeeper must have forgotten about washing them
