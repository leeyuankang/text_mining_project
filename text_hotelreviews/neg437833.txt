the layout of the room was terrible we had a room on the floor the tv was mounted on a wall not facing the bed making it awkward to view the screen the wardrobe space was limited and directly by the door one too many furniture makes the room cluttered the sewerage stench from the toilet was unbearable and we had to place a towel over the floor trap we fo not recommend this place for holiday makers no shops or cafes next to building a few minutes walk away there are a couple but this is it pricing of accommodation was attractive but for the inconveniences one is better off paying a little more to be in the city centre subway is more than minutes walk away
