the only negative i would say about the hotel is that the street it is on is rather industrial with a lot of garages and businesses but is not at all noisy however it is within walking distance minutes of major attractions eg barceloneta picasso museum etc and it is very convenient to the metro and tram lines so while on first sight it seems a bit out of the way it is still very accessible and the public transit system in barcelona is easy convenient very clean seemingly safe and reasonably priced
