small room no view noisy room breakfast not included in room rate expensive bar no late check out we were woken up very early in the morning with the housekeeping staff making noise in the reception area at in the morning this is because our room was on the first floor and the bathroom had a window rather than a wall so they need to sound proof the room so there is no noise
