having checked in and having been allocated a room the manager decided that the room was too good for me and it should be allocated to another my luggage and valuables locked in the safe were removed in my absence personal possessions locked in a safe should remain private they should not be accessed without permission in my view the new room turned out to be very noisy and the bathroom plumbing did not work dirty water was deposited on the floor from a leaking waste i needed to paddle in dirty water from the wash basin the only saving grace was it was my dirty water the sound proofing between rooms was abysmal the normal level conversation in the adjoining room kept me awake the noise level from the street was also high with the window closed and curtains drawn guess a single night stay was not sufficient to warrant a decent room despite the a night price tag would never go back
