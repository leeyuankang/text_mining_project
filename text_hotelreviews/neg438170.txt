we had to change rooms as some of the rooms in this hotel do not have windows so if one is at all claustrophobic these rooms can be challenging also the pool is very small the lobby bar was not open while we were there although it looked lovely and the roof top bar restaurant although nicely designed does not provide a view and the food was very disappointing
