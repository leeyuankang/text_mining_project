free wifi was very slow and had a very bad connection for us internet is one of the most important things when we stay in hotels double bed would be better if its wider pillow not comfortable too low and long breakfast in the room can be better orange juice tasted like its mixed with sparkling water extra plates too eat from would be nicer bathroom can be cleaner bathrobe or slippers would have been a nice touch because floor was little bit too cold to walk on i really missed water kettle and hot drink making facilities
