the room was on the small side for people although i was very happy in my exceptionally clean standard room for a day break there was not enough manoeuvring wardrobe or drawer space half of my clothes had to be draped on the back of a chair there was no space to hide away toiletries that said it is not a complaint just a design flaw i would recommend upgrading to a larger room if you are staying for more than nights i will go back for sure
