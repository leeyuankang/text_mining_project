i can t really complain about the hotel because it exceeded expectations considering it is only a star hotel but if i had to make a negative comment it would be that the shower takes a while to drain which can be annoying when you re standing in a puddle of water also the shower door couldnt open fully because it would hit the sink we didn t try the breakfast so i can t comment but there seemed to be a lot of choice
