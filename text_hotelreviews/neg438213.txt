we asked the room with the shower instead of a bath and the room in the higher floor but in reception they said that they fully booked even though you can tell that they wasn t the room was small without any windows and any balcony so it always was lack of fresh air and the thing that you cannot see what s the temperature and the weather outside that was really annoying also room insulation was terrible you could hear everyone and everywhere and as it was february you can imagine what sounds you could hear clearly going from your neighbors that was so disgusting all in all the money that you pay for the stay is only worth for the place that is in the city center
