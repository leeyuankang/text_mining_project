the receptionist was really rude really rude made me feel uncomfortable and not welcomed in my favorite city in europe and when we asked for the manager she told us he wasn t on duty that day the room was so tiny different from pictures the shower box wasn t well sealed so after every shower the toilet was full of water on the floor ten years ago i stayed in a hostel as student and i had a better experience than this hotel i wouldn t recommend it to annyone beside my worst enemy the hotel doesn t even have enough staff for a star rooms are stars maximum
