we had a two day booking but needed three days i requested this on day one they told me the third night wouldn t be a problem and they again confirmed this on the second day however when i arrived at reception on the third morning they told me they didn t have a room for me and i had to leave we had made no alternative arrangements and we found ourselves on the street with no where to go in a barcalona which was full to bursting point the hotel staff had no concern and no consideration for our situation when i put it to them that they had twice assured me there would be room they just ignored me we ended up in a hotel miles out of the city this event completely ruined our trip
