we asked several times if we should book for the restaurant and were told no just come down when you are ready however when we did a very snotty man from the restaurant told us they were fully booked and ushered us away with no other advice so we went elsewhere the swimming pool is actually no more than a pond on the roof and there are no views from the bar terrace the bar downstairs was never open either
