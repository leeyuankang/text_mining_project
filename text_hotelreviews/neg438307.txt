we were given the wrong rooms for the night until i mentioned it it was all very designer ish which sometimes didn t mean comfort the sinks were too shallow the bed didn t leave much room to walk around in fact i cut my leg badly on the edge of the bed no mirror over the desk which meant either using the bathroom or the long mirror but saying all that we enjoyed our holiday
