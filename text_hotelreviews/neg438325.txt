the air conditioning did not work meaning we had to open the window at night so it wasn t too hot given the location this meant it was very noisy and we didn t sleep well there were also no tea coffee facilities in the room or iron for a hotel at this price i would expect this as standard also the roof top pool and bar was shut which was disappointing
