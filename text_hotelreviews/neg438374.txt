if you end up with a room over the restaurant they make lots of noice late into the night we could hear them banging dishes around until after midnight the showers are spacious but need some tlc mildew in corners under caulking the air conditioning is silent and works well however the thermostat in our room was directly below a vent so it turned on and off all night
