the receptionist was very rude and very disrespectful towards myself and my partner we enquiried a few times and the female receptionist was difficult to interact with and very threatening towards us she had charged us for facilities that was already in our room we paid for already and tried to get money out of us i felt she was taken advantage of us because we are from england and speak very little spanish she authorised money to be taken out my account for these facilities which we had paid for on booking com once confronted at reception when we was checking out she said not to worry about the extra charges she alleged had i find this hotel a con and would stay away compket jmmmmm
