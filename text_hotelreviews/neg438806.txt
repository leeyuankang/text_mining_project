the location of the hotel is not close to the metro station you have to walk for minutes and is far from the center is good if you want to be in a quiet place but not a good idea if you are going for tourism when we arrived the sink was broken and the bath got flooded as soon as we opened it the good think is that they fixed it in few minutes
