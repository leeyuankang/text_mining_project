i feel the staff were very slow and somewhat lazy numerous times both my partner and i either visited reception or the bar and asked for help ordered a drink and each time is took more than mins at one point i asked for one beer and the bar staff chose to answer her mobile instead i didn t like that there was a mini fridge in the room which was fully stocked but was never informed that we would be charged for anything we took this should be communicated stronger either when you check in or clearly stated on the fridge your rooms should also have iron ironing board facilities rather than trouser presses and a modern hairdryer rather than a tube that blows out air from the wall
