food in the restaurant was very expensive for what it was breakfast was extortionate parking expensive and one evening the electric went off so our car was stuck in the car park we complained and the hotel only paid one way for us to get to la ramblas so we had to pay euros to get home which we had not budgeted for through no fault of ours no lounge area to relax indoors with comfy seating our room was supposed to be a no smoking room but the bathroom smelled of smoke slightly when we arrived
