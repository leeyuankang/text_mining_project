the cleaning personnel opened the door on us a few times but we did forget to put the do not disturb sign on the door partially our fault the location of the hotel is fine if you want to stay around upc or the football stadium however to go back after a late night city visit you are restricted to a bus at least it runs all night and to a steep walk up the hill it did not bother me that much but prepare to be needing a cab from time to time
