the night duty staff on our check out at was absolutely horrible tried to make us pay again for our room even though i had a receipt and proof i had already paid made our taxi to the airport wait outside for minutes with the meter running called the booking company after being told i was wrong and treated so badly never once got an apology and after half an hour on the phone of the conversation going in circles he finally realised he was wrong and we were free to leave this made us late to the airport and nearly miss our flight his mannerisms were appalling and never once said he was sorry or showed a bit of empathy terrible customer service from this one man which is a shame as the rest of the staff were lovely
