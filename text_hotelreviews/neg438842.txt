the location is not good its is quite far from the metro system and you have to climb the hill on the way back the area has no amenities no super markets drug stores etc the hotel is also located next to a big hospital which means that there is noise from air conditioning systems etc finally for some reason the hotel decided to have a truck pick up the laundry in the middle of the night they made such a huge racket they even managed to wake me up and i consider myself a heavy sleeper
