not so great location for la ramblas city centre staff in this hotel are very very bad arrogant and rude one evening we ordered food at the restaurant burgers and chips basically there was of us and the food took an hour to arrive my drink didn t arrive and i had to ask for it no apologies or anything from staff breakfast is not so great not worth the price they charge there are some great restaurants in barcelona i would recommend to go to those instead
