kilometer walk from the nearest metro station if you want to visit your room in the day to change clothes drop some stuff it s a lot of way to walk the room was clean but the towels smelt really bad i ve been to many hotels but i ve never seen something like this i requested an extra towel at night not at a late hour and the receptionist said i had to come to reception and get the towel myself i wasn t feeling very well but i had to put on all my clothes back and went to reception i think it was rude it wasn t a twin bed it was just two single beds united
