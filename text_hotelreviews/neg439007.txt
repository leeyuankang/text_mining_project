great location but disappointed by service standards bedding and supplies in room not changed for days had to ask cleaning for fresh towels each day check in lady was very rude when she did not bother to check full name and told us that we booked two rooms for five nights and infact later found out that family name belonged to another guest in hotel she should have been careful before accusing us that we made booking not her and later she realized that she did not read the full name carefully and our booking was accurate she was not rude intentionally but a reckless in processing information before jumping to conclusion room service day excellent i great guy room service day very poor ordered vegetable noodles and given chicken noodles despite reminding times reception was kind enough to not charge later but was very disappointed with star hotel requested adapter and waited for two hours to get it and reminded twice before getting it gym was decent and enjoyed it reception staff that checked in could have been little welcoming but that was not the main issue good points hotel is very near to metro stop and very convenient to reach from airport martin at reception was very polite and sincere gym and sauna room was ok
