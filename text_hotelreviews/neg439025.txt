it feels like a business hotel that is trying to be family friendly there is a sterile air to the hotel the staff are friendly although lack a little training regarding customer service on arrival i was clearly struggling with some bags yet when i went inside the doorman was so busy chatting to and laughing with a pretty woman that he hadn t bothered coming out to help the staff were helpful behind the counter on all occasions when asked for assistance but only gave part of the answer for example is there an atm near here please yes sir across the road in that direction i came back to the hotel after being unable to find the atm only to be told that it was inside a supermarket out of sight and that i would have to go inside it would have been nice to know that the first time i asked so a reasonable travelling hotel not a comfortable one for a romantic weekend the staff need some client orientation training
