on our first morning we enjoyed the continental breakfast in the club room with sylvia she was wonderful and later did the high tea with sarah also great being able to enjoy the amenities of the second floor club room made us feel special and worth the extra price for the room then on the second day we were told that we should use the main breakfast room near the lobby instead of the club room for our breakfast and because we had a club suite it would be free of charge unless we ordered ala carte the coffee was great but sadly i didn t find the breakfast experience worth the price charged to those guests not staying on the second floor
