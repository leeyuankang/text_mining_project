we had booked rooms one was for my disabled elderly mother in law and her carer the hotel did not have the correct number of beds in the rooms they kept us waiting for hours trying to organise extra beds which never appeared when we eventually got beds for everyone the rooms reeked of cigarette smoke some of the sausages at breakfast were half raw perhaps they were trying to poison us it was a complete shambles none of the staff seemed to have a clue and mostly spoke poor english after weeks we eventually received an apology and refund for one of the rooms would never stay here again under any circumstances
