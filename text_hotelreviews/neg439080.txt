we had a very poor night s sleep because the mattress was far too firm and the synthetic pillows were hard we made a verbal complaint at reception and all they offered to do was to inform the management the lifts were operated via the room s swipe card but were temperamental stopping unexpectedly between floors on all but one journey we made we talked to fellow customers who said they had experienced the same problem we didn t report this because we had already complained about the bed not surprisingly we won t be staying at the hotel again
