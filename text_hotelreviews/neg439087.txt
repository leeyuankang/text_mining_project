there were a few problems on arriving in the room found it was made up for a twin but we booked double rooms so we had to ask to move there was only towel in the room we had to ask times to get an extra towel which finally arrived at gone midnight twice during the evening and next morning we had to get the key reset for the room as it did not work this was annoying after getting to the room and having to go all the way back to reception
