bit chaotic with poor communication room not fully ready although we d spoken to them about early check in and they d confirmed okay but when we came back several hours later they said no room was ready and to come back in an hour or pay to upgrade to a more expensive room finally they got us in a room that wasn t really ready bed configuration was wrong so someone had to come and rearrange the room shower gel and other bathroom items not fully stocked so we had to call down for those but they did sort these later when we asked just took about an hour to get room sorted content and decor in room and bathroom a little old and worn but clean and sufficient and comfortable
