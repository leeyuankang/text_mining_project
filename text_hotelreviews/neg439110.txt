rooms were extremely tired dated and the furniture was not in good condition at all carpet was horrendous like being time transported to the s but i hasten to add it was very clean and the bed although small was comfortable enough the windows were designed not to be opened so had to have a noisy air cooling system on that was very loud if you wanted the room cool enough for comfort the rooms were fine for us as we just needed a bed for the night whilst we were out shopping and site seeing in the day to be fair i wasn t expecting much anyway as it was the only hotel with rooms left after booking to see adele who later cancelled her concert but if you wanted to treat yourself and your partner i d advise pick another hotel or upgrade the room
