the architecture is a shock i expected something grand given the location but copthorne tara is not grand think functional and you ll be alright the windows didn t open the window unit was old and didn t work well which meant the room smelled musty and was too warm during a sunny summer visit shower curtain smelled bad could use some modern updates
