dont eat in the club lounge i found it to be quite small to cater for large mass of people at meal times most staff are nice and accomodating but you do encounter a small number of staff that are rude and make sure you feel uncomfortable we ran out of toilet paper and it wasnt replaced during room service we rang concierge twice with no answer then attempted to contact reception which in turn transfered us to the same line again with no answer please keep in mind i am not a whinger you just expect a standard of service for a facility that claims they are stars
