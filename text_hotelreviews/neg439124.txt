check in was a complete mess i had booked two club rooms and had previously spoke to reservation for two rooms adjacent one for me and one for my daughter travelling from toronto and was allocated rooms and on the floor my daughter checked in and was allocated room great i arrived an hour later and was told that the only room available was my room had been allocated to someone else i could not believe the incompetence after about minutes they found two rooms together on the floor so my daughter had to move all her belongings from one room to another breakfast being in a club room we had access to the club lounge went for breakfast could not get a table all occupied redirected to the main breakfast room took away the pleasure of eating in the club lounge which we paid for not impressed this hotel certainly needs a manager
