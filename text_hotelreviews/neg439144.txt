this was my second business trip to this hotel in one month i stayed a total of days on two business trips in the club room level of the hotel and i will not be going back the first night at the hotel was a disaster the noise was so bad from the air conditioning units outside that i had to change my room three times to give the hotel some credit they did try hard to resolve the problem but the issue is the hotel itself rather than the personnel working there this hotel needs an upgrade especially the double glazing there is absolutely no soundproofing at this hotel and all the noise from outside can be heard in the room i was there with two other work colleagues who all complained of the same issue one of my colleagues who stayed on the other side of the hotel said that he could hear the train literally passing in stereo through his room all night we all went to our conferences very tired and agitated the crazy thing about this experience was that we stayed in the club room level of the hotel these were supposed to be some of the best rooms in the hotel the other thing i noticed was the beds do not have fitted bed sheets covering the matress they just use flat sheets which means that in the morning you are often lying on top of the mattress with half a sheet under you this cannot be hyginic and is not something that i have seen in other hotels the bed was also very hard and uncomfortable certainly not what you would expect from this standard of hotel as part of my job i spend at least weeks of every month travelling around europe and unfortunately i have to give this hotel
