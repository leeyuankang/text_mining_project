the lounge was very busy at the time we went for breakfast we must have chosen a popular time it was difficult to get a table and the staff seemed overstretched or inadequately trained they were all very frienfly and courteous but it seemed rather chaotic for a short while the cutlery given was inadequate fork knife and spoon i would have liked a side knife to spread the butter etc a fork to use with my spoon for the fresh fruit and a teaspoon that caused unnecessary delay and duplication of work for the waiters as we waited for them to be brought from the kitchen
