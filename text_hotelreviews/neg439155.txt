the hotel public areas are ok but the room they originally put me in was grim room on the mezzanine in case you need to avoid i had booked myself into a double room and inadvertently to one where mobility could be assisted i found myself in a single room at the far end of the corridor on the mezzanine which looked like it hadn t been refurbished in decades and which reminded me of a run down hospital with bed and bath lifts the windows didn t open and there was a stale smell the chair had a stain which i feared was urine i really could believe they were charging central london four star prices for this and felt people with mobility difficulties would get a terribly raw deal they did transfer me to a double room that was merely shabby rather than grim i have made a mental note to never return here
