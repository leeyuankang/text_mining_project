i rang the hotel direct to try and book parking and was told to book through justpark com however this cost extra which i assumed would be refunded at the hotel as they advertised parking fee this was not the case staff saying they didn t know anything about it i was very unhappy but the staff tried to be helpful and gave us free breakfasts to make up for the overpayment we d incurred in the future though all hotel staff need to give the same correct information
