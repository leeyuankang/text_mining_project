no complimentary shower gel in bathroom or walk in shower room service menu limited and expensive if required after pm food in bar restaurant average though plenty of choice close by in hindsight i would have waited to book until much closer the time as room prices drop dramatically on line and breakfast is also included in deals anyone booking two days before my visit was paying less than me and had breakfast included a little annoying considering i honoured my booking reservation
