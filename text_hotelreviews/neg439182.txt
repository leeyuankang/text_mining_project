the hotels car park staff seem to have a little side earner going where they told us to pay them directly cash for parking but when we went in and asked at the front desk we were told they should never ask for cash and that this was wrong and they then played it off as it must of been a practical joke between the front desk attendant and car park attendant i thought this was discussing that this is going on not only could i have been charged twice for parking but i also didn t know who to believe or who was telling the truth or who to pay so others should be warned of this
