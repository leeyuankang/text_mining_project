unfortunately i got double charged on my room and the staff just tried to talk around the issue and didn t really take responsibility checked out two days ago and they still haven t taken off the double charge and my bank says it can take another week absolutely not okey the staff s attitude just made it worse and the whole experience gets ruined i would never give them my credit card details again
