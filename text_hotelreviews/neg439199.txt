check in early sunday afternoon not enough staff were available when i got to the desk the check in was really fast pleasant and efficient but standing in a queue for mins before getting to the desk was unpleasant and in my opinion unnecessary other clients were unhappy and complained about the delays not good feedback for the hotel guest services desk staff were brilliant with guidance on maps trains buses etc again on occasion more staff would have speeded up the process timing is the key you need to research when are the busy times and schedule staff appropriately overall guest services were great
