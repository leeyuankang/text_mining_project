wifi was very very slow i couldn t even check emails i booked a double room but at the check in i was told a double room was not available they said they could zip up two single beds in a twin room but i would have to wait for a while since no staff was available i exhausted from a long flight opted for bearing with a single bed as always the case with this hotel the reception is short staffed and i had to queue for minutes or so just to check in and out
