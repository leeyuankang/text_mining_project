the club lounge was very dark and the only seating was tables and chairs no sofas or comfy chairs it was also very small considering the number of club rooms available and breakfast was packed at with people having to share tables with other guests in the afternoon when i was there with only a few other people present the manager was conducting an interview with one of the receptionists in there i thought this very unprofessional as i could hear details of her salary etc so i left and went to sit in the lobby instead which actually was brighter and had big leather sofas
