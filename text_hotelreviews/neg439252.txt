the porter was trying to be helpful but i found him rather unnerving as he did not explain what he was doing and just took our cases somewhere we then had to get them back because we needed them immediately the reception staff were rather slow and there was some confusion because i had paid via booking com the day before and been told the payment had been taken then the hotel reception staff told me i had to pay as it turned out only one payment was taken there was pretty much anything you wanted for breakfast but the porridge was made with water and was very watery and the toaster only toasted on one side of the bread some cranberry juice would have also been nice
