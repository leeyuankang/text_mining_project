the staff in the bar restaurant were slow and due to us being on a small time scale didn t seem to move any faster once we had made them aware with having troubles with the hotel from the beginning they took payment twice once without my consent which emptied my account and then could not issue a refund for days they promised me a room upgrade for all of the party well if they upgraded my room god knows what the standard rooms were like the bed was clean but very small and we had no room to roll over breakfast was pricey and a little disappointing
