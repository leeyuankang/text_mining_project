we paid for an upgrade to a club room the room was ok but the club lounge which we had our breakfast in was too small for the number of people who were allowed to use it it was chaos and the staff did not explain that you could order extras for the breakfast the evening drinks were served with a weird combination of onion rings and fish fingers which seemed a bit strange
