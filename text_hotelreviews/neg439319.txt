the rooms are incredibly tired we were on the first floor in a standard room and the room was very old and worn the walls were stained the bathroom door had a big chip at the bottom the bathtub itself had a burn mark inside the hotel provides a non slip mat for the bath but it s a discoloured grey with yellow stains around the suction spots it wasn t particularly nice to use touch there was an unmanned express checkout desk but no explanation of what to do we were made to wait to checkout it had to be done manually via computer not ideal when pressed for time the wifi was quite poor kept cutting in and out it was difficult to plan our tours
