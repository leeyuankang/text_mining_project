i had trouble with my room key on a couple of occasions and had to return to reception to have it resolved i guess because it was close to my phone or i pad on arrival at my room wasn t ready this wasn t a problem for me but it could have been if i d been in a rush to get somewhere else however the receptionist was very apologetic and offered a drinks voucher for the bar my friends had arrived at about and had the same experience it didn t spoil our stay however and the staff were excellent worth noting that my friends had also booked a club room theirs was on the tenth floor and wasn t quite as roomy as mine
