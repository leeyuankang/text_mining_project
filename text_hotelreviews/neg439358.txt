the room was a very poor standard upon arrival we paid extra to upgrade to a superior double room the room was in a very poor condition the double bed was two singles joined together the wardrobe door was broken there was pipes and wires exposed around the room there was grime on the bath taps and the bath was very dirty and needed replacing the kettle has lime scale on the outside of it and the cups were dirty upon arrival the breakfast that we paid for was cold my juice was warmer than my eggs overall it was a very poor standard and nothing like the pictures advertised i would recommend trying the holiday inn next door before this one
