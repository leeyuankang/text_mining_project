when we checked in we were told breakfast wasnt included i was nearly certain i had paid for it but couldnt prove it as i had no internet i upgraded the room so i could get breakfast and wifi the superior rooms are practically the same as standard not worth it i cancelled my upgrade once i proved i had paid for breakfast previously at time of booking hopefully i should get refunded soon also one room for breakfast felt neglected when we got in there were no bowls or plates once we got them it was fine asian restaurant area
