the hotel was extremely busy during the beakfast period although we didn t have breakfast and didn t have to wait in the queues each morning it was extremely difficult getting to the ground floor to exit the hotel the lifts were full waiting time lengthy on the one occasion we managed to secure a place in the lift we travelled from the second floor up to floor stopping at each floor on the way up and on the way down the hallways were full with people waiting on each floor to go down to the ground floor the stairways are difficult to find no sign posts to stairways and those marked discourage use by indicating it was a fire escape route only and not a normal stairway i asked the concierge about the usage of the stairs and his reply was its difficult we located the stairs and used them but we are fit and able with no heavy luggage others were not so fortunate
