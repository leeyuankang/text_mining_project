my room felt dirty as the pictures will show white walls marked all over outdated furniture in the rooms and the bedside cabinet was put at an angle because it did not fit light switch has dry paint splatters all over it lamp shade broken and hung to the side and blown bulb this was certainly not a hotel i stopped in room and my work colleague in i was very upset that my work colleague was allowed to add a bottle of wine to my room without my prior consent i have uploaded photo s of the room and i will most certainly not book a room at this hotel again not for me not for my business or family i travelodge or ibis has better standards than this grotty place oh not forgetting the tariff for hours parking
