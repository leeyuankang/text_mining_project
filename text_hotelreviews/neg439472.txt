i had stayed at this hotel a few times before i made a non refundable booking on booking com as were the cases before upon check in the reception staff said i would have to make a payment i pointed out that the hotel charged my credit card before check in and i was told that my stay was pre paid at the check in for my previous stays the staff said she double checked and my stay this time was not prepaid so i reluctantly agreed that the hotel charges my credit card at the time of the check in a few days later checking my credit card statement i found that the hotel charged my credit card twice obviously i disputed about one of the payments through my credit card company but it required extra time and efforts wifi was unstable and sometimes completely lost internet access cups and spoons had visible stains
