on check in we were upgraded to a twin room on the club floor having stayed at this hotel many times in the past albeit some years since my last visit little had changed in terms of room decor in my opinion a refurbishment of the rooms are overdue the single beds were very narrow below standard for such a hotel moreover they were uncomfortable the bathroom ventilation was poor hardly effective at all the condensation fell like rain drops from the ceiling after having showered and did so for a long time afterwards
