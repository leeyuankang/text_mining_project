this was our stay at hotel within xmas period again the club lounge was extremely busy and we could not access for the evening drinks hotel needs to look into their policy for selling club rooms breakfast was the same in the morning queuing for breakfast in club access in the end we cleared a table and set it for ourself no senior manager on duty to speak too very disappointing breakfast choice for star property is very limited tara hotel could be an exceptional hotel with a bit more care
