can t speak to other rooms but on the top floor the ceilings in the bathroom were very low made it tough for a tall person not to bump their head multiple times the shower was disappointing a head that could be affixed to a pole to use as a shower the tub was difficult to drain and the shower head didn t go very high again tough for someone who s tall the room overall was quite small not that you re in paris to stay in your room but it was a bit claustrophobic
