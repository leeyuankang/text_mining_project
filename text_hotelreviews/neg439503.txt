perhaps you can be a little overattentive on arrival we had just about got ourselves sorted out after travelling and were about to settle down for winks when reception rang to enquire if all was ok last evening after returning from the albert hall we just wanted a quiet little something for a late night snack at the brasserie was quite noisey with a number of children running around we tried to sit away from the noise but were moved away from the table of our choice because it was already set for breakfast we noticed another couple who came in for a nightcap similarly affected on the positive front the location is first class and it s likely that we will use the hotel in the future
