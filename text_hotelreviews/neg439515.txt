did not take payment until day of booking and as this was booked by me through bookings com i was furious to discover that our company card was refused as i was not there in person to pay i had booked it for our trustees staying in london for the night and fully expected that my company card would be debited as it appeared to be at the time of booking at the non refundable rate the hotel and bookings com were unhelpful and our trustees had to pay themselves not good business and very annoying
