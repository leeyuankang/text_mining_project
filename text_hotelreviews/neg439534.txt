for some reason my debit card was not debited at the time of booking or when we checked in or out weeks later they got in touch with a form to fill in with my card details to send back in the post you guessed they say these details never arrived i thought it was a bit odd asking me to send this info by post and now i m worried my name address and card has fallen into the wrong hands probably a dodgy member of staff at the hotel so it still hasn t been paid not my fault and they are sending me emails asking for payment but no apology for their incompetence so be careful now i have to cancel my card and it s nearly christmas and it s all their fault and i m quite cheesed off actually
