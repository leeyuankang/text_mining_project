check in was slow despite staff milling around my room was tired a little grubby in places and the flush mechanism on the toilet in my room broke causing water to pour out of the area behind the toilet as well as into the bath response time to this incident was poor and despite the engineer being able to see that i had used all the towels available to soak up the flood it was left for me to discover that if there is such a department as housekeeping they never answer the phone exhausting stay won t use this hotel again it s not worth the money for a poor nights sleep
