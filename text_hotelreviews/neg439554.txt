room cleanliness poor staff looked unhappy and not helpful at all with the exception of the concierge who was very helpful and should give some training to the others porter you can do without because he does not seem to do anything just the same not even once we saw him smile let alone basic greeting we travelled for medical reasons and need to extend our stay by days went to reception bluntly was told sorry we re full up understand that hotel could be fullup but the way it was done and no help offered whatsoever was told to call reservations from the room and it took more than minutes to answer hope this feedback will help because this is what i would want in reverse
