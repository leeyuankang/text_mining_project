firstly the car park has tiny spaces and difficult to manoeuvre around with many cars parking across two spaces do they pay double i wonder there is no lift from the car park to reception so you walk down a dingy corridor with hanging pipes and cables through doors with chipped paint and up about steps struggling with luggage to reception here you wait in a queue for about ten minutes to check in because guess what only three of the six check in desks are manned and a coach load of tourists has just beaten you to check in we ask a bored looking concierge if there is somewhere for our year old disabled mother to sit whilst we get our key and are directed to a few stools in an area cordoned off by a red rope which he makes no attempt to move for us so we can gain access so we move it ourselves we finally check in but only after having to give again exactly the same information that we had given when making the original booking we were then asked what time we were checking out on our leaving day not soon enough i was tempted to reply and we had only been here about half an hour we were due to go to a show at the albert hall so back to our friendly concierge once again but he said he didn t know where the albert hall was but asked an equally bored looking colleague who muttered it would be five minutes by cab my faith would have been lifted a little if he has said brightly let me know what time you wish to leave sir and i will hail a cab for your party but i suppose we can only dream we had booked two rooms together so we re not really surprised when one was on the first floor and the other on the fifth the rooms were clean but basic with ultra thin pillows no choice of pillow like premier inn and the narrowest double bed i have seen in a hotel for a good many years now and we have been to quite a few we decided to eat at the brasserie before going to our show
