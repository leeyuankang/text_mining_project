the room was much too hot even with the heat turned off the room was noisy as we were on the tube line side of the hotel room we were there for two nights and neither day did the staff leave any shampoo or bath gel foam i had to ask for it it did arrive promptly it was obvious that the staff did not check the bathrooms properly
