i booked this stay for my elderly parents who were visiting london one evening my parents needed a doctor the staff did not call a doctor at all and kept on lying to my parents that one was on the way my parents stayed up waiting all night when we found the manager the next morning his explanation was that they could not understand my fathers accent and that they did not take cash payments despite the fact that my credit card was on file and they succesfully billed for a stay my family has stayed at this hotel over the years on our london breaks and it is an excellent hotel great location with majority lovely staff i was livid at this negligent treatment but my parents refused to move because of the kindness of some of the staff but clearly this is completely beyond the pale i will never recommend this hotel and do not entrust them to do the right thing for the safety of their guests
