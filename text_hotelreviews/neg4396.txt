the room they gave us was on the floor no it was a small room looking at the interior of the hotel it was s very dark room it had only windows and you could look out only through the one the only thing you could see were machinery and there was a constant noise that did not stop at all day or night the elevator did not reach our floor we had to take about steps as well i do not know if this room was given to us because we booked a value deal anyway it was not cheap also we asked the hotel to book us a taxi for the airport they told us it will cost pounds we were persons and we told them that we had luggage big and small when the taxi driver took us to the airport he charged us pounds because he said we had an extra bag in my opinion this is unacceptable i would not stay in this hotel again
