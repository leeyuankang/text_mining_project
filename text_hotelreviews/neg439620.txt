very disappointing compared with previous stays first room we were given was small and had a safe on the floor which we could not reach moved to a better room similar to previous club rooms we had occupied on second day when we returned in the evening we found that the bed was unmade and the room not cleaned this was done when we contacted reception altogether rather tired fabric and tired staff a great pity and a sad decline as previous stays had been fine
