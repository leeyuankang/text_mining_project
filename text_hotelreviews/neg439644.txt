poor service by reception did not record that we had ordered breakfast or morning newspapers did not record that we had recorded a credit card for extra items whilst on our stay this caused embarrisment with bar staff who insisted that we had to pay as we went along this was resolved but should not have been necessary also room maid cleaned room whilst we were at breakfast and had not put sign out to clean room also took ages to prepare decafinated coffee at breakfast and also took ages to serve irish coffee after evening meal all small things but as they say many mole hills turn into mountains
