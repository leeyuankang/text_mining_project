i resented the fact that once i got there i had to listen to a sell about upgrading and adding breakfast and upgrading my room because i just reserved a standard room i almost felt like i was wrong to reserve a standard room it was like listening to a used car salesman and i didn t like that i finally very nicely told the young woman that i trusted that she was going to place us in a room that i would be totally happy with and and wouldn t have to come back down to the desk and complain about i saw several negative complaints on the tripadvisor site and didn t want to have to deal with a situation like that in the end we got a lovely room that was clean well appointed and very satisfactory
