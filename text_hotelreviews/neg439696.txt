the breakfast was chaotic but there was a warning that the time we attended would be busy and it was but it did not need to be as chaotic customers were asking for butter and they were told there is butter and were given flora margarine and made no attempt to go and fetch butter from the servery kitchen customers then asked managers and they fetched some pats of butter but a couple of minutes later a bowl of butter pats turn up surly butter and margarine would be on offer at any reasonable standard of resteraun this is only a minor problem and did not effect us personally
