as a solo traveller i had booked a double room for single use i got a room smaller than the other rooms on my floor the room was still very pleasant and roomy but there should be a special rate for these smaller rooms my room was on the floor on the side of the kensington high street underground station the first time i heard a train go by i though it was a fast developing thunder storm however by putting the airconditioning high i did not hear the noise any more and had a very pleasant stay n b i stayed in this hotel in march and then had a bigger and quieter room and gave the hotel a ten i must confess i had booked a superior plus room now just a superior one
