i had to complain to the manager as the window and curtains in my room were filthy there was used tissue paper in the window frames despite pointing this out to the manager when she came to my room and promised to have it cleaned the windows were semi cleaned curtains were still filthy and the dirty paper still in the window frames i do not expect to see such neglect in a star hotel i ve stayed with copthorne many times in the past and never had any complaints before this was meant to be a club room i dread to think what the standard rooms are like in this hotel when we checked out the receptionist did not ask how our stay was which i also find unusual for a star establishment i can honestly say i have stayed in b b accommodation which has been much cleaner
