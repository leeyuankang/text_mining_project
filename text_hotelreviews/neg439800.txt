wifi signal was not great in the room i didn t say anything at the time but the receptionist said they could have put a router in my room or improved it in another way so if this happens to you ask the business centre was small with outdated software i could only use an old internet explorer which made gmail hard to navigate and dropbox impossible to access don t rely on it
