poor service we paid an extortionate amount for one night we had a fault with our lights in the room so after a late evening out we came back and found the lights turned themselves on throughout the night when we complained in the morning they said that they we should have told them in the middle of the night who wants a maintenance man or to move rooms at and that they could do nothing for us a budget hotel anywhere in the world would not have lights turning on in the middle of the night let alone a highly rated hotel in kensington not happy worst sleep i ve ever had the room itself was very basic
