i was given an easy access room after there was some confusion over my booking my name was on the booking form that reception had asked me to sign however it also contained someone else s address i m a restless sleeper which meant i constantly woke up to find i d almost set off the alarm to call for help as our room was set up for easy access i don t require easy access we also had a room adjoining ours and later in the evening we discovered that this door was unlocked which meant anybody in the room next door could have entered our room at any time housekeeping was sent to rectify this late that evening but we were very uncomfortable that we had unknowingly left our room that day with it being easily accessible to others the staff at breakfast were a little too hasty to remove our plates before we had finished it made us feel like we were rushed and being constantly monitored just so they could take our plates away
