the booking process could have been better on arrival i asked if i could pay with a different carsd as the payment hadn t been taken but they were moving me around between reception reservations and b com that it exhaust me to the core so my initial experience was unsatisfactory and as i was on a holiday i didn t want it to start like this in my experience the reservations team had the tools to make this easier for me and to make me happy but they decided not to speak to me on the phone not to make the payment with a different card and instead they told me to call b com as they couldn t be bothered was quite upsetting happy with the reception team as they have to face the issues while the reservations team can t even answer the phone what a shame
