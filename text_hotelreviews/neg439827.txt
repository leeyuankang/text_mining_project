getting the room serviced was a problem also we came back to find that cleaning staff had left our room unattended and insecure this was reported at pm nothing was done we had to request a toilet roll and also milk at the next day we returned in the afternoon to find that our room was not cleaned despite our hanging the please clean our room card on the door this was again reported this time to the duty manager who promised to look into it he also bought us a drink in the bar this was very sad as we have stayed here before without incident
