i booked this hotel because booking com advertised childcare babysitting this was not the case and i was left with no options for my husbands birthday party which we had booked nearby we travelled from australia for the occasion and the staff seemed unconcerned even when i insisted on an interconnecting room so we could be close to our children this all seemed too much effort staff really lack any personal skills the nearby hotels offer babysitting and this could ve been suggested to assist rooms are pretty average double bed very small only child can be accommodated hence having to book rooms
