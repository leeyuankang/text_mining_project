early morning concierge service left quite a bit to be desired i had a letter to collect and laundry to drop off the person who had to find the letter for me was working at a glacial pace and treated me like i was interrupting his free time i was also told that the laundry service turnaround hours were much longer than listed on the sheet supplied in our room this meant we did not have time to get it done although we had budgeted time according to the information supplied had no clean laundry for the next leg of our trip we had already been travelling for weeks at this stage
