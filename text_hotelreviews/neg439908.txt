we visited this hotel a few days ago having booked it online where the pictures looked great it was a great location and the staff were courteous and efficient however we were in a superior suite and the room was very tired and in need of updating it was clean but the d cor was very tired and out of fashion the bathroom mirror edges chipped the wall had marks on them there were gaps between the bathroom finishes this would not have bothered us if we had paid a much lower price and the online pictures had been more truthful finally this is a large hotel which was very booked resulting in congested reception areas breakfast and bar for most of the time we will not be returning
