as i said first stay here was amazing this time different room on different floor and we found the room basic and disappointing look like it needs updating and fridge cabinet very dented and scruffy tea making facilities were poor hardly any milk pots and small amount of coffee sachets no biscuits it was such a shame as we were excited to stay here again as the last room was so nice and the same price
