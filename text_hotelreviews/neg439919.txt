furniture old but kinda maintained nicely bed when i first laid eyes on it i felt so grateful i came with my own traveling bedding set beddings were awful obviously out dated pillows didn t match in size filling at all i mean there were four of them you would assume them to be a couple of sets but no no sets just four randomly picked pillows rug ugly by all means really amp tired spotted in some sides other sides seemed to look cleaner curtains room was too bright at day even when curtains were all down was bad windows can t be opened thanks god we booked two separate rooms otherwise we d be long dead lacking oxygen as we stayed for a week bathroom no way that was a bathroom unbelievable too bad curtain wasn t clean and ugly the whole design was poor actually toilet too old and wasn t clean even when house keeping came toilet was still not clean enough there was a yellow spot that was too strong and disgusting they managed to make it lighter but was still there flooring reacted against water it grew rust i mean it s a wc how could that be amp i did not like the toiletries didnt enjoy the smell of the products slippers came under request what an old style of sinks and showers walls paper thin i heard every single phone call my neighbor had he wasnt even shouting i heard him going to the toilet talking to himself i heard the house keeping everybody passing by i heard everything location noisy at least the side i stayed at i learned to ignore the noise coming from the subway which was actually my view the highstreet kensington station is on the district line nothing s interesting on the district line you ll keep on changing trains its not great but not the worst thing to me
