furnishings in rooms were tired the first room we had was an adjoining one and we were woken up at am with the entire conversation in the next room clearly wafting through the adjoining door clearly no privacy and we had to tell them through the door that we could hear every single word they were saying asked for a room change since we had two more nights and it took ages rang reception to follow up and it took forever to get someone on the phone was told that he would call me back in mins but after mins i had to call again and wait again to connect to someone someone finally delivered the key to the new room and dashed off despite us being told that we would be assisted with our luggage didn t need assistance but some recovery service would be great
