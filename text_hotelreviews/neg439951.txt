this is a huge hotel and there are many tour groups staying the reception and guest service desk concierge are understaffed i had to wait for minutes to check in and another minutes to collect my suitcase i left at the guest service although there was no queue when a large group of guests arrives waiting time will be extraordinary they charged in addition to the room charge on my credit card without telling me i know some hotels request pre authorisation for a certain amount to cover additional charges during the stay but normally they tell me before doing so charging customers credit card without notifying them is not a good idea they didn t give me a invoice receipt at the check out i assumed they would email me as some of the hotels recently do again they normally ask if i want a receipt emailed or in paper however i was later on told when i called the hotel to enquire about the unknown credit card charge that they wouldn t email a receipt unless i specifically request it that means they wouldn t give you a receipt unless you ask which is unusual and rude their complementary wifi was slow and you will possibly have to pay for a faster connection if you would like to do some work or watch online video the room didn t have an available socket around the desk or bed so i had to work on my laptop on the tv stand which was inconvenient
