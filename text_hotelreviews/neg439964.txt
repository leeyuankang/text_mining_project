we were originally given a room on the floor at the end of a corridor it was noisy sounded like construction work next door the shower didn t work didn t switch from bath to shower we were changed to a room on the floor i would be upset if i d paid more for this room as it was very similar to the one on the floor in summary very disappointed with the stay the lady on reception didn t seem to appreciate why i was so upset and very reluctantly went to ask a manager for help it was a special treat weekend for us but it was spoiled by our experience at the copthorne tara
