very dirty and dated room an extra bed required the removal of most of the furniture from the room leaving us with nowhere to sit had we known about this we would have paid more and booked a different hotel i even telephone before i booked to make sure a third bed was no problem and to explain the importance of this the extra bed did not even fit in the room after the removal of furniture and left nowhere to walk safely slightly larger rooms are available on the top floor but one of these was not used there were no dressing gowns or slippers as advertised the shower was broken etc etc etc i could go on the only good thing was that there was a phone and so we could call down for the repairman the hotel just wasn t up to scratch i travel a lot for work and i have stayed in far far better premier and jury s inns it spoilt what was supposed to be and was otherwise a very special treat for a young boy s birthday as well as his first stay in london we were told that a gift would be left in the room which i thought was a nice touch but this never materialised the club room which we paid extra for was too full for our breakfast and so we were made to join the end of a very long queue in the main lounge until we complained when i asked about these things the receptionist pretended to go a speak to a manager but i believe this was a way of getting me to go away never again and i shall think very carefully when i book any other hotel in london if i bother at all if anyone does book go with very very low expectations
