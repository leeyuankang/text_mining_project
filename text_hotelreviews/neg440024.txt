the cistern in the bathroom took a long time to refill to a level where one could use it again when we wanted to order sandwiches from room service we were told it would take half an hour which as we were going out seemed rather a long time so we didn t pursue it but at least we were told how long it would take we were able to buy sandwiches cheaply at the snack bar in the foyer at breakfast the toaster in the club lounge seemed somewhat wonky with no automatic pop up but these were minor matters our experience at the hotel was in general highly positive
