it s very old hotel breakfast is really poor not all the stuff is nice but most of it a woman at the reception refused to call a taxi for me and insisted to take a cab outside they said it will be less expensive but in fact it s much more expensive so i had to figure it out myself fridge in the room worked like a freezer walls are so thin you can hear alarm of your neighbors not even talking about voice or sneezing would not recommend this hotel
