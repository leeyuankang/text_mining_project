unfortunately our trip was made very stressful as the rooms booked were not available we were a wedding party wanting rooms on the same floor and in various party sizes we were allocated all over the hotel and the wrong type of rooms we paid extra for accommodation we did not get and the staff seemed unconcerned the bride to be was further away from everyone making it very difficult to help her get ready and she had a very small room my son s room had a cracked toilet which he reported but nothing was done about there was lots of little things wrong which may not have seemed as bad had there been less problems with the arrangements booked
