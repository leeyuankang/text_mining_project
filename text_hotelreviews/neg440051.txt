the only issue i had was the bedroom was very dated and shabby looking for a hotel such as the copthorne black stain marks on the ceiling from wall lights dirty skirting boards hems of curtains falling down etc but as only having an overnight stay as part of my daughters birthday present she felt there was no need to make any issue of it but otherwise we had a very pleasant stay with alot of consideration given to your staff who i feel created a very friendly inviting comfortable atmosphere within the hotel
