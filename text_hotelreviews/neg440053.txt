at check in i was offered to add breakfast for each myself my young son so i duly paid at breakfast i was told that only one of us could have breakfast i challenged this and the staff were offhand and waved me away and said ok have the buffet this was upsetting so i asked for clarification and a member of staff said he would go to reception check he came back but ignored me and i had to go to him he said i had misunderstood and that i had not paid for breakfast but a room upgrade that included one breakfast this is not how it was sold to me at check in i would not pay for a mediocre buffet breakfast this was embarrassing and unpleasant i did not feel that i was dealt with properly
