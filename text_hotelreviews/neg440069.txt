wifi slow and very difficult to connect to got a second passcode from the staff that didn t work either messed up our booking no english speaking staff made this process very frustrating in our club room their premium room type our shower didn t work properly there was only bath robe there wasn t even a bottle of water our year old kids ended up having to sleep in a double bed together overall a very disappointing experience stay here if you re a business traveller on a low budget but not if you want good service avoid if you re a family
