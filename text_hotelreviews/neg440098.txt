we asked for a quiet room but instead were given a room that had an adjoining door to the next room so we heard everything from next door overlooked the railway line was only a few rooms from the lifts we had to complain about the noise from next door on the first night and on our second night for our third night we were upgraded to a room on the top floor with no adjoining door although it was still overlooking the railway line the night staff who handled our complaint were excellent but which member of staff allocated us to one of the noisiest possible rooms after we had asked for a quiet one or are they all this noisy we would not return to this hotel
