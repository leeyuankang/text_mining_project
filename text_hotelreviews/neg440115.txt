the staff on reception at least the one we encountered she could hardly speak english and her manner was brusque all other members of staff were friendly the wi fi it doesn t work unless you upgrade to a more expensive room which is what they encourage you to do on arrival the breakfast not enough fresh fruit or veggie options it seemed very expensive for what was on offer although my carnivorous husband thought it was ok stuffy room the windows can t be opened so you have to have the air conditioning on all night
