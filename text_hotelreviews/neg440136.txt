i stay at this property almost every months everytime i check in most of the rooms arnt ready so they checked me at the floor maintanance rooms which were kinda bad the power sockets at so low i have to place the coffee maker on the floor and the lights are old ones not electronic pad like the ones on floor sheets needs to be changed as they are worn out also during my last stay in januaray i used the blankets and it was so rough and old totally not comfy i ordered room service breakfast and i got soggy fruit bowl and not so fresh pastry i love staying at this place but it needs little changes to accommodate their guests in the future
