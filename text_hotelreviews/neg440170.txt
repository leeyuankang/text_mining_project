the bedrooms lacked any draw space for clothes and the rooms looked tired a long slit in the apholstery of one of the chairs wallpaper coming off the wall and veneer worn off the furniture the reception staff denied that the rooms ever had a chest of drawers incorrect to our certain knowledge as we have stayed in this hotel several times in the past and there has always been a chest of drawers poor customer service to tell us we were wrong when we were undoubtedly correct the room was much too hot not helped by the fact that the air conditioning pumped out warm air even at its coolest setting it was cooler with the air conditioning turned off but still far too warm this is all a shame as we have always been happy with this hotel during our several stays over the last few years
