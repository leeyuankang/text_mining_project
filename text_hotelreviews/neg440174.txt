some of the reception staff spoke very poor english on arrival while my bedroom was a good size it was right over the train tracks so don t think sleep is option outside of the hours of when the trains stop the wi fi is also so appalling and practically useless which in this day and age is unacceptable lets also say that it seemed a lot of guests had night time visitors so all in all find somewhere else as this hotel was not a pleasant experience from start to finish
