the hotel has seen better days the d cor generally was tired various fittings in the room were in need of repair notably the table which wasn t level and the sink tap which bled black bits after use the room also stank of smoke which got worse when the a c was turned on the staff were generally uninterested on early arrival i asked if i could have access to the room to get changed as i had cut my leg while travelling i wished to dress the cut and change any clothing which had blood on it two of the three staff members i asked were perplexed by the question despite being able to see the injury the third staff member offered me a band aid and use of the ladies toilets its not easy trying to open a suitcase in a cubicle five minutes in the room or any room and i would have felt a good deal better disposed towards the venue i particularly didn t like the attitude of the duty manager when we checked out and raised the issue of the faults in the room he implied it was our problem for putting up with it but on past performance ie the lack of effort while i m standing at reception bleeding i wasn t hopeful that anything would have happened i further was not impressed by the implication in pre arrival emails that the hotel was going to upgrade us as it was a celebration stay they didn t instead they gave us one slice of an inedible lemon cheesecake i remain unimpressed as the promised follow up from the hotel regarding our concerns hasn t happened breakfast was average service remained indifferent not what i expect from a four star hotel i wouldn t recommend or return to it
