this hotel an old beat up aer lingus hotel that was sold to a giant chain looks like a disused munitions factory some staff are poorly trained and have insufficient english the phone in the room didn t work so my arrival was terrible a workman came to my room many times but he was unable to fix it if i needed info i had to go down to the lobby it was ridiculous i hated the hotel really and i ve stayed all over the world the staff don t care about you because it s a big busy hotel and you feel that you re on a dingy production line
