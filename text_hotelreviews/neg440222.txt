there was a language barrier with some members of staff which made it difficult to order room service as they had misunderstood what we had asked for on the phone the extra blankets provided were made out of the most itchy material we ve ever come across and we re not comfy whatsoever the windows in the hotel room didn t open so we couldn t get any fresh air in we requested a double bed and ended up with two single beds
