we upgraded to a superior plus room assuming that this was two levels above a standard room in actual fact they call their standard rooms superior they are not d cor is old and tired rooms are basic and for a superior plus room i was expecting a large bed not the small double bed that was there for a weekend close to christmas the price was reasonable for london but not significantly cheaper than other local hotels we could have paid a little bit more per night for a much nicer room overall disappointing
