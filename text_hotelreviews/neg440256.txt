the hotel is undergoing refurbishment with only floors left to do floors and we happened to be on the floor and i found the superior double that i had opted for was tired very warm and small unable to open windows to allow any fresh air in would i stay here again yes i would but would request a newly reburbed room just to see the difference great location with parking and easily assesible from hammersmith flyover
