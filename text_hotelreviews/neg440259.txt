my main complaint is the size of the bed it was so narrow that two persons couldn t sleep comfortably in it i can t believe that s standard in a superior double room at a star hotel that s why i ve rated comfort and value for money low because otherwise the hotel was fine the room was too warm and even with the ventilation on the windows couldn t be opened and put on the lowest we were suffocating in the night
