i booked a superior but to be honest i wouldn t have classed it as a superior at all the rooms need a good overhaul i tried to shut the curtain and the curtain and pole ended up on the floor the heating didn t work i did speak to receptionist and she moved me immediately lucky they had another room available staff were very good
