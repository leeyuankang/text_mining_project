i had booked the room in advance for one night my friend and i decided to stay another night at first i was told there was none available and then the lady came back with a ridiculous price so we didnt book another night and moved hotels i asked for another body wash as there was only one in the room the lady argued with me for some time before eventually sending some up not quite sure why as having travelled for a few hours i had showered upon arrival and needed products for the next day when they arrived there was plenty i only asked for one first they didnt want to give then went over then top
