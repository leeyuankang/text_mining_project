well it seems unfair to say but i m honest so to help others i will we always have breakfast in bed as i am a hard working avid hotel traveler the first morning breakfast was faultless delicious the others went down hill also the bath had a horrible plastic curtain inside the bathshower system i hate those the actual shower was very good though the hotel manager upon hearing my comments however was quick to make sure i was compensated he handled everything with great compassion and fairness i was happy when i left i would therefore recommend and also retrurn next month
