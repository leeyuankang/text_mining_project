the room was very tired the bathroom especially the basin taps were loose the toilet seat was loose the air conditioning was not easy to use either too hot or cold hard to regulate breakfast was a bit cramped and food only adequate we have stayed in several different hotel chains all over london and this is possibly the worst as for a four star we expected better we were told this was a superior room so i hate to think what a standard room would be the view from the room was a roof
