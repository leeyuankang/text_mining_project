breakfast experience in the club lounge was a let down thankfully our unexpected upgrade from superior to club meant that we hadn t really paid for it in our room rate but still a disappointed though staff quickly seated us and brought us tea they neither asked whether we had stayed before and didn t explain that it was self service it took another couple to tell us after we had sat there for minutes finally english breakfast was warm cold so definitely room for improvement
