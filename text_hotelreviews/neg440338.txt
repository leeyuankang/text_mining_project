staff upon arrival unable to understand the very strong accent of reception staff room booked superior plus room room allocated could not by any stretch of the imagination been classed as a superior plus despite the window having been left open by cleaning staff prior to our arrival the room smelt the net at window was dirty and hanging off its rail the bath shower were badly stained and chipped the fridge cabinet and wardrobe were quite obviously a diy job and very shabby the room room offered club was an improvement and probably what we were expecting of a superior plus having stayed at this same hotel in the past we were shocked to see how much it had deteriorated and wonder how it still warrants its status
