i reported a broken toilet seat within minutes of my arrival and was assured that it would be fixed when i arrived the following evening it still hadn t been replaced very poor service as when checking out days later it still hadn t been sorted i will never return to the copthorne tara and it s likely that i will not use any of the copthorne group hotels in future
