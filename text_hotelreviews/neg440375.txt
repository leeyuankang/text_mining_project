we had a bad experience with the lift our card stopped working at and my friend and i went in the lift seperate times and both our cards didn t work and we were stuck in the lift on our own and got worried because the lift doors didn t open so we couldn t get out we were both frightened and had to wait for someone to come and use the lift we didn t know we had to get the cards active again as we were upgraded to check out at can you let other customers know as it was a very bad experience and upsetting that was the only complaint we had otherwise we had a great time
