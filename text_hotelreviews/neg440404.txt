noisy trains could not sleep could not change room very poor internet service this was particularly frustrating as nobody seemed to know how to resolve this and i eventually had to go to a local cafe nero to access internet and conduct business despite putting in several complaints nobody seemed bothered to find a solution following the first attempt room service poor quality aged towels dusty wardrobe iron not worth using as it took minutes to iron a business shirt the only positive about my stay is that the breakfast staff were absolutely wonderful
