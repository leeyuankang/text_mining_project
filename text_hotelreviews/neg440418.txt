not a good locaci hr the hotel area is kind of run down and dirty we understand that is a historical location the hotel is nice but still scary to walk around at all hotel could use more english speaking personnel as well as dinner waitresses the waitressses round around alto and is hard to get their attention it took requests to just add the dinner tap to the room and more than hr nice breakfast buffet
