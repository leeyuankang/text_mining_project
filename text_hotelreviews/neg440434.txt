having booked with you on several occasions on arrival although it was before check in i enquired details of room and found they had to find room matching our requirements which i feel that as we had booked with this hotel really early they mustn t have taken details down at first it was suggested that we could have a similar accomodation but with adjoining room i did not want this but the receptionist who was very helpful found a suitable room which was fine i would hope that in future if staying here again that they would consider guest s requirements more as far as booking com is concerned we have always been more than happy with your service
