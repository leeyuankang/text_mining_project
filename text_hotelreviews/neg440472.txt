we had a small problem on arrival as the kettle in our room wasn t working i traced the wire back behind the large piece of furniture on which the kettle stood to find it was turned off at the socket so had to move the drawers luggage stand very heavy away from wall to switch on my husband is blind and he could not have resolved this had he been on his own our second night was slightly spoiled by excessive noise from people in next room so slightly better soundproofing would help we both found the bed a little too firm for our taste these are minor problems though
