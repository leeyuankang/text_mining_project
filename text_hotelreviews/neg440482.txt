the service was sloppy definitely not a star in my opinion it s barely a star on arrival my partner and i were expected to take our own suitcases to our room ourself no porter service was offered i requested house keeping to bring cotton buds on numerous occasions needless to say i am still waiting and the overall service of house keeping was not acceptable we left a carrier bag of trash next to the full bin and it was left there for two days they literally made the bed and brought towels they didn t replenish the teabags or cotton pads nor did they bring them on request the most disappointing experience was breakfast where i found a piece of bright blue plastic in my omelette the dish was taken away but no apology was made the waiter just brought a new omelette without communcating with us and more importantly without an apology
