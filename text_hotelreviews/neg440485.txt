arrived early but the receptionist wouldn t even check on the system to see if a room was free we understand the hotel is busy but were surprised that she refused even to check the concierge wouldn t less us stop in front of the hotel for just a minute to put bags because a vip was about to arrive the vip was just another family doing exactly what we wanted to do perhaps they had pre tipped better overall we have stayed many times and will do again as the hotel is usually great but we suspect the hotel management has recently changed and this has has a detrimental effect on how customers are treated hopefully this will be addressed as it s a great hotel
