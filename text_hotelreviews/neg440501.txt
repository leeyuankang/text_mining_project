we arrived at after exhausting travel from liverpool st due to tube strike only to be given a room that was already occupied by another guest we then had to take our luggage from the floor and go back to reception to get it sorted and be allocated another room on the floor which was rather mediocre by then we couldn t be bothered to ask for another room so we just accepted it albeit not impressed
