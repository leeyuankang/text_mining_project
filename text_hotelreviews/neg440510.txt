a terrible night s sleep the adjacent room had a very loud dehumidifier fan running in it all evening at we rang reception and asked if it could be turned off for the night as it was proving far too loud to sleep it was turned off about minutes later but despite having been told the noise was very disturbing the dehumidifier was turned on and off again several times during the night and workmen started work in there in the small hours we complained in the morning to the duty manager who said he d investigate and get back to us but we have heard nothing since
