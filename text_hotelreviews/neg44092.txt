room was a bit smaller than i thought but was perfectly adequate missed having a set of drawers in the room to put clothes items in also main dislike was that the windows both had obscured glass in so you couldn t see out at all however no e of these things affected our overall stay which we enjoyed a lot and would definitely stay again
