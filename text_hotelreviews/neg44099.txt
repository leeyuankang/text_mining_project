the room was very small my request before booking was not even acknowledged the air con unit was broken which made it an uncomfortable temperature at night the bed was a little bit bigger then a single which for a couple made sleeping very difficult wifi kept disconnecting with low connectivity message continually popping up lastly i was charged for damage to an iron and throw i did not use the iron and not to sure how the throw got damaged from sitting on it they have sent me pictures of the damage which is irrelevant as it was not caused by my stay the lady who i spoke to regarding the charge said that they have several people who check the room before the guest stay to ensure all is in good working order i mentioned to her if this is the case why was the air con not working the on button was clearly broken and can visually see it her response wa did you report it her answer contradicts the several services checks they apparently do before a room is occupied by the guest i am currently waiting on a response from mr greg black the general manager which i should receive on in regards to refunding me the which i have been charged for damage which has not been caused by my stay
