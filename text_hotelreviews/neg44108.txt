the breakfast was awful smoked streaky bacon has no place on an english breakfast it is an american preference the hash browns were bland and no flavour whatsoever the sausages were very over cooked and tasted awful the eggs were hard the beans were solidified i couldn t eat my breakfast it was that awful so i gave it to one of the staff in the dining room so i could make room on the table for something else the waitress looked at me with daggers for not eating the meal she didn t ask me why or if there was any problem with it and try and help me she just scowled at me and took the plate to the kitchen for namesake the waitress name was alexandra i then had fruit and toast and the fruit was going brown in the bowl and mainly consisted of apple and little else my added cost for breakfast left a very bitter taste in my mouth
