we booked standard double rooms was half the size of the other with the tiniest shower room ever the other room was much larger with a bath and room to swing a cat checked with reception to see if we had been allocated correctly and was told it was a standard because it has a queen size bed this maybe the case but you could hardly walk round the end of the bed and would have said it was more one of their cosy doubles i dread to think how small a cosy double would be very noisey from extractors and the aircon was as loud but you do get ear plugs
