ok it sounds like a list of stupid things but they added up to a poor experience the room was very small we had asked for a superior room with the larger bed this is basically a small room with a large bed in it so the floor space was minimal at the back of the hotel so quiet but very cold it was a cold night and the heating had been put on the lowest setting even when we turned the heating up the general warmth was pretty poor and we did not warm up at all this was not helped by the two windows in the room having poorly fitted and broken frames although they were double glazed there was a chill wind coming through the sides the heated towel rail did not work in the bathroom so the bathroom was also freezing we were told in reception the following morning that this was deliberate but not why the bed was very uncomfortable not because it was too firm but because it was way too soft like sleeping on a piece of foam with massive give we both woke up having had a very bad nights sleep being freezing cold and could not wait to escape two teabags only so our morning cuppa was a bit limited we skipped breakfast as we felt that each was a bit steep even in london we had room service which was good and the food was also good but generally we were cold and uncomfortable and had a very poor experience sorry mercure but it was not a good stay at all
