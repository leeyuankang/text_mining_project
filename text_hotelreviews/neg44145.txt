rooms very small and cramped staff were unaccommodating our son got food poisoning and was sick so at we rang the front desk to ask if the hotel had any over the counter medicine available for an upset stomach they didn t have any so the receptionist was politely asked if it was possible for a sprite or a coke to be delivered to the room first the receptionist stated that i would have to come downstairs myself to get the soda because if they brought it to the room it would cost extra so the cost for the small soda would be pds i was not bothered by cost at that point so asked if the soda could be delivered anyway two minutes later the receptionist phones back to say the soda couldn t be delivered to the room as i had not opened an account with the hotel for ancillary expenses this was deplorable customer service as a business traveller i visit london often and will never stay at this hotel again i do not recommend this hotel to any other traveller there are much better options available in the area
