water pressure in the shower was a little slow the breakfast was tasty but the buffet tea bags pastries etc were not restocked frequently enough there were quite a few people waiting for eggs hash browns etc for quite a while some members of staff in the restaurant at breakfast were not welcoming and one in particular was quite abrubt with customers it might be useful to include some training for staff on how to give guests a good experience of a stay in london based on british values for example someone with a good command of the english language welcoming guests into the dining room treating their colleagues with courtesy and respect staff taking the time to chat and engage with guests would be good too we did witness some staff being rude and abrubt with colleagues in front of guests
