location has a couple of negatives busy commercial street and there s a bus stop at the entrance with a very long railing blocking the sidewalk from the street this makes taxi drop off with luggage an issue since you have to get out a long way from the front door and there is no doorman to spot arrivals and come out to help with luggage however this is just the way london can be and the hotel itself is perfectly fine
