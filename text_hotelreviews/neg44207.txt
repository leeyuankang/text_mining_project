there were only small issues the bill for our evening meal had a service charge added to it without any prior warning we would preferred to of just tipped the staff personally with an amount of our choosing please note that the double bed within the small double room is only a size bed this is obviously due to the size of the room i personally had no problem due to me being short and slim but i feel this would be too small for anyone taller and of a stocky build please bear this in mind when booking your room size
