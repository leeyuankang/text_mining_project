the biggest problem we had was the breakfast unfortunately we got seated straight away at but when we went to choose our breakfast there was nothing much available we both had a bowl of cereals but had to wait for some milk to be bought to the counter then when we went back to choose something from the hot selection there was nothing available and so therefore had to wait minutes for bit by bit the cooked selection to be refreshed the coffee machine also kept breaking down and the staff were having to keep coming to try and fix it after waiting for the cooked selection to be bought out time had passed and it delayed us in our plans for the day as we were meeting family to go to some of london s attractions
