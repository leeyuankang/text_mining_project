we did not like the waiter at the restaurant who served us dinner on december evening he did not change the table cloth which had food stains looked unhygienic when pointed out he just scratched on the stain blew some air from his mouth and left like that he was not courteous and his etiquette was not befitting his role as a waiter of a decent restaurant our opinion is that this person was not of austrian origin he has not received proper training he does not know does not care about the values and customs of austria western europe it is good that immigrants are given jobs but this cannot happen at the cost of not ensuring that they are fit for the job and without adequate and proper training it should be emphasized that the person who attended to us during our breakfasts was just the opposite he was excellent courteous friendly with a smile and service minded he spoke german and english too and was of european origin we are not prejudiced so we hope our criticism and remarks will be understood and taken in a positive way the room it was too hot and thus very uncomfortable and difficult to sleep at night the air temperature control did not function this is a waste of energy which one should be concerned about in the context of climate change problems furthermore think of the energy savings that can be achieved courtyard by marriot must do something in this respect
