we asked for double bed but we got a twin room instead without any explanation or excuse the elevator is slow the parking is eur per day and the garage is very complicated to use the room is not very clean for example there was mold on a shower holder and stains on the bathroom door i had some problems with internet in the room as well even though you mostly pay extra for it
