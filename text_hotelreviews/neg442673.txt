we usually go to small family run hotels or bed and breakfasts but thought we would treat ourselves to something upmarket and go to a marriott this hotel was not at all what we were expecting it was more like a uk travel lodge or premiere inn where we have had great stays it is just that this was not what we were expecting staff were generally somewhat grumpy though we understand this is not unusual in vienna our bed was broken and could not be used there was no alternative room for us and no manager available to speak to as the next day was a saturday we were told there would still be no manager to speak to we were offered camp beds we were understandably unhappy about this so the bed was fixed late in the evening by putting boxes underneath it this worked and the staff dealing with this were very friendly but again it is not what should have been expected internet was only free in public areas and did not work well there in general we were very disappointed after looking forward so much to our visit to this hotel we visit austria fairly often but will not go back to this hotel there are plenty others to choose from
