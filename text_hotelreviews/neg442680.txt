after doing the booking i had repeatedly requested early check in but the hotel didn t respond to my requests as expected i reached the hotel a few hours earlier than the check in time i was weary after a long travel my spouse was sick but we had to wait for quite some time before getting the room though this was technically before regular check in time my experience at various other destinations has been better than that here
