i m not sure if this hotel deserves the name of the hotel was different on the building than on booking com i booked days before arriving it was confusing and made it hard to find the mattress with springs was incredibly bad not comfy at all as the matter of fact it was painful to lay on it i could hardly sleep a few hours and one of the springs were even higher than the rest a hotels should never provide a mattress like this the breakfast was poor i expected much better the place for the breakfast is small maybe that is why the choice was limited i didn t like this hotel i m not coming back
