the shower is in the same space of the bathroom than the toilets once you took a shower the floor is covered with soap and water it might be modern and covenient to clean but you have to walk in water to use the toilets then breakfast is ok but i saw much better in simpliest hotels guest houses moreover the beakfast room is just the space at the entrance next to reception not easy to move between the tables and quite noisy
