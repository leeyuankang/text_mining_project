we arrived and we did not have the room we booked so they placed us in a horrible little room someone entered my room at to this moment no one replied to me or gave me an excusse what a lack of professionalism why would people from the staff enter my room unannounced if i was clearly inside the room who does that and what if i was not awake since i was unable to sleep in that horrible room what would happen what would have happend if i did not caught them sneaking into my room the room was located on the floor and i could smell the breakfast it was horrible how is it possible that you can smell the breakfast at floor the room was noisy the walls were dirty we felt like omg like we were crashing in someone s couch as a favor but we actually paid for a service we did not received they gave us what they may call superior room on the floor what is was probably the room we should get and guess what the shower did not work and we reach out to them an no one came to help us saturday night and i had to experience this kind of lack of care and service this property completely failed to provide btw and the heat temperature was broken in order to breathe we needed to open the window how awful is this the amount of stress and annoyance given was beyond anything they promissed to give us a complementary proseco never got anything staff was basically hopeless absolutely no one has give us any compensation or anything at all we exchanged rooms x this is unacceptable and btw this is not even close to a hotel also they have room service as a described facility and guess what they do not have this lady of the front desk told me straight and also told me she could not do anything to assist us that this is what we get well let me tell you i utterly regret it it was the worst experience one can have also the breakfast is basically the same every day
