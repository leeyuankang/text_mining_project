i believe that this is not a stars hotel or not the room we ve received the bathroom had worn finishes or swollen water the ventilation was broken without sound isulation both inside and outside more near the windows it feels very cold from outside i had to put some pillos on windows to keep warm very very few tv channels i think maximum the breakfast was terrible cheap preparation no taste rotten fruits nothing gourmet parking you don t have even the posibility to find at least one free parking space in front of the hotel when you arrive we are not able to take your lugages in a normal way you have to carry on them from where you succes to park your car and you can park for free only for min but this only in the case that you ask and you receive from the reception a paper wich allows you it after those min you have to pay every hours and this means that you have to come back at your car every hours starting pm every hours some guys from the city hall comes and gives fines so the best way is to keep your car in the paid garages i ll not recommend
