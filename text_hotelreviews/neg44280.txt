due to my unexpected sickness i needed to shorten my uk trip when i checked in i asked the night shift female receptionist if there would be any flexibility and possibility to cancel or refund partial hotel booking fee of course i fully understood of the terms and conditions regrettably she rejected immediately and spoke to me loudly at the lobby that you don t need to speak to me so rude but i didn t and i recommend you to claim the insurance instead of asking the hotel for assistance just a request i was completely and totally shocked by her unhelpful manner next day morning the hotel manager has provided assistance after she understood the situation
