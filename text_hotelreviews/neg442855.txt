the hotel cannot be classified as a star hotel in my opinion breakfast is served in the hotel entry way and the space is rather crammed the food was not bad but little varied when we entered the room they gave us it was quite a surprise when we realised the room was already occupied since there was luggage in it i find this unacceptable the rooms is too small and simple for the hotel s classification
