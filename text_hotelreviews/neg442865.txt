the bathroom smelt terrible because of the savarage the parking lot was far from the hotel euros per night about minutes of walking by feet it is terrible if you have luggage and if you park the car in front of the hotel the police blocks it immediatly you only have mins when checking in and if you run out of them you may pay a bi amend also the breakfast was not fresh i believe that the croissants weren t changed every morning but when eaten by the guests also there was no meat except some cheap crenwurst and a little salami we went to breakfast atabout in the morning so we didnt catch any we havent seen any bacon and the water wasnt good for being consumed it seemed like it was from the sink because of the chlorine smell the rooms had dirty walls and two holes there wasnt any painting on the walls not even on the hall of the hotel we took photos but we cant post them here it was like sanatory ironically the name is la prima fashion the bathroom smell cant be expressed in words but after taking a bath in a stars hotel from budapest we were trying to avoid the bathroom the staff was ok but cold with us like we were talking to robots all in all we have to say that the price service raport was totally not ok
