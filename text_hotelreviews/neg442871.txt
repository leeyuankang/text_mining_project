the walls in our room were dirty and scribbled with a pen and something was tipped behind the table one of the bulbs was burnt out from the begening the staff seemed to be not so proffesional we had an opportunity to hear about everything related with serving breakfast but when i asked if the breakfast is included the receptionist finally decided to read my reservation so she could discover that our reservation didn t include any breakfast when we later informed that the walls in our room were dirty they said only that we wouldn t have to pay for this damage and that everything was fine it was quite funny but pathetic at the same time moreover we declared the early check out we had to catch the train during the check out when we had already left our hotel cards back and asked for the permission to go the receptionist told us with the angry voice that we didn t pay the city tax so we had to stay there coudn t they really charge me during the check in or even ealier because it was the advance paid booking
