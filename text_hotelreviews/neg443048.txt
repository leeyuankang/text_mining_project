the location is very inconvenient if you want to be in the city it s a far walk from the metro bus station to the hotel daytime wasn t too bad but i wouldn t recommend at night the shuttle from the bus stop to hotel is euros per person steep price for a short drive the view from our room was a juvenile detention center some fast food restaurants the hotel room itself is not comfortable if you re traveling with someone that isn t your partner the shower is in the center of the room so you have no privacy also beware that in order for the electricity to function your room the key must be placed in the holder by the door so if you need to charge something while you re gone you ll be out of luck
