this was the first hotel in holland where we stayed we arrived early morning in holland after a hour flight so we where very tired but couldn t check in untill the lady on the reception was very nice but there was also a guy who was very rude we ask around if there was already a room available and he just let us stand there while not checking anything after a while he started a discussion with another receptionist who is gonna call to check if there is a room the hospitality really needs to be worked on also the a c in our room did not work and we had to call the reception to control the a c from somewhere else so we could not manage the a c ourself the price is way to high for what you get i expected to be more luxury and better service
