overpriced considering the lack of facilities and location extremely noisy work going on outside for nights of the stay without any warning or apologies which somewhat spoiled the stay staff were mixed some really good others not so good air conditioning in rooms was next to useless based on talks with other guests seemed to be a problem on various floors maintenance of rooms wasn t great either with various lighting problems
