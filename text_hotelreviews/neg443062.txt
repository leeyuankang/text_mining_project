first night staff were terrible didn t explain if card had been charged on the second night we got back and cleaner had left our room open all day we then got relocated to another room as compensation which was then given away with all of our stuff in the room staff had no idea what was going on and it was due to the manager not keeping record after an hour of worry and hassle we were relocated to again another room and offered us free room service we received our room service an hour after and once again a great disappointment i am a strict vegetarian and received meat in my salad after clearly stating this to staff we also received no cutlery and got our drinks an hour after upon complaining to the manager her excuse was our night staff are from a security place and what do you expect we are a big hotel also the walk to the metro takes around minutes taxi prices are ridiculously expensive and the hotels hourly shuttle is euros each
