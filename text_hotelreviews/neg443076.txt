we had problems the hotel is min working from the station from some reason maybe based on wrong comments here in booking by other travelers we were under the impression that we can call to the hotel before coming back with a train to the station and request for a shuttle then we realized that we can get it only on a round hour which is far from being efficient in case you are coming min later even when asking the hotel if the shuttle can wait or maximum more min for us to come we were refused other problem the beds are twin since the mattress is very soft you can actually fail between the beds
