the location is too far out to be considered a city hotel the hotel advertises a shuttle bus service to and from the nearest train station which is around mile away however in reality this shuttle only operates once every hour and cost euros per person per ride also the shuttle stops operating at which is not much good if you have plans to dine out in amsterdam at approximately a mile it is not far to walk however if you have spent the day wandering the streets of amsterdam that mile walk back to the hotel becomes quite tedious also due to the location and time of travel to and from the city mins train min walk it is not easy to pop back to the hotel for a rest or drop off any items you buy meaning once you leave in the morning you will be out for the whole day the bar service was very slow with the staff often seemingly forgetting your order there was no water in the bedrooms and when we asked at the bar could we buy a bottle of water we were given the option of sparkling water or tap water as they had no bottles of still water although there is a coffee machine in the room there were no glasses to even have a drink of water if you wanted oddly enough a bottle of water appeared in our room on the very last day perhaps it should have been there all along travel to and from the airport is easy enough by train however there is a real lack of information in this respect with guests being pushed towards the airport shuttle which costs euro each where as the train cost only euro each and only took minutes including change
