the tram station is minutes walk km from the hotel there is a shuttle to the tram station but it goes only once every hour and costs euro person the toilet is nothing but private the shower looks nice as a glass tube which is cool only if you are with someone you enjoy looking at naked meanwhile the toilet had a wobbly door that doesn t close completely und wouldn t provide sufficient noise isolation
