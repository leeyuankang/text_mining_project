location this hotel brings the definition in the middle of nowhere to a whole new level food a chef that serves some undefined frozen fish but with a bite of frozen lobster along with over roasted unpeeled baby carrots and an undefined something that could be anything between a splint of driftwood and a used vanilla pod into a broth heavily polluted with cream and a cracker on the side and call this bouillabaisse is capable of anything i d suggest crossing the road and get some better food at the burger king cleanliness poor carpet shower walls everything gave that feeling i do not want to touch anything here nor walk bare feet totally unexpected i have to admit rooms self pretentious illogical tiny uncomfortable just name it the shower cabinet in the center of the room is just a very very bad idea perhaps more suitable for one of those places that offer hourly rates plus there is not a single little surface at hand height to place your own shampoo or shower gel bottle and in order to close and open the stream of water you have to bring the selector through the cold position which is not nice if there is no room to set aside toilet no privacy whatsoever the enclosure does not close properly let alone locking and if you are sitting for the big thing every few minutes you must waive enthusiastically toward the movement sensor unless you want to complete the operation in the dark sink more or less the size of a soup plate and placed at the end of the room desk mind your elbow panoramic view of amsterdam if you like to see how a kfc restaurant looks like from above search no further this is the hotel for ya i ve never noticed that they look like fried chicken buckets thanks fletcher
