i am now back from my trip from amsterdam i think there should be a few more points made on the summary so that people have a real idea what they are booking firstly from the airport to the hotel was euro in a taxi it takes mins by car to get to the centre and we were euros each way you had said it was only mins i also found the receptionist really unhelpful and rude they didn t make us feel welcome at all we called room service for sprites they came with small glasses mins after we called also it was our boyfriends birthday so we were celebrating in the room with some processco so we called for a bucket of ice and glasses after mins of waiting for the ice and glasses to arrive they didn t so we had to call them again mins again of waiting they finally came to our door not even an apology for taking mins to bring a bucket of ice and glasses which is absolutely ridiculous for a star hotel
