the coldness or the rooms staffs attitudes no direct information of facilities or restaurant times so we didnt av food or breakfast once we found ourselfs eatin out every time which cost alot more we complained of cold room and wasn t offered any extra warmth etc heater or blankets we wasnt told we had to book shuttle hour in advance so wasnt happy we had to pay for taxi to airport also no menu for restaurant you have to view online which isnt easy to access overall it made what was ment to be a good birthday for my partner a bad experience and miserable moments
