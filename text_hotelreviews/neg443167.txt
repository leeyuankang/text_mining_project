i did not like the staff from the reception specially during the night shift i have worked in a hotel before as a receptionist and customer service was always we phoned the reception twice for champagne glasses and a charger and they took more than minutes to bring such as simple things or if we phone them back asking for it again they would suggest us to come downstairs to get it as they were really busy something that should never happen also when we used to ask for something at the reception the night receptionists wouldn t even look into our eyes like we re not there however when we got there we wasn t even told about any information at all e g facilities customer service was really poor i would expect better for the money that i ve paid
