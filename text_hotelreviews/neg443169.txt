first of all i would like to start off by saying when we arrived i was instantly upset as me and my partner couldn t walk in the rotating door together as it was too small for two people to fit into the cubical i m very shocked that the shower was in the middle of the room i assumed that it was just advertisement and they would have normal bathrooms but apparently not this really made me feel uncomfortable as i had to shower in front of my partner and we have never seen each other naked before when i eventually plucked up the courage to have a shower i then discovered that there was no where to place my towel for as soon as i got out i had to walk a few steps to reach my towel and by this point i had become very very cold my partner then used the toilet and i was disgusted to hear what he was doing in there i just cannot believe that the hotel don t supply ear plugs we then made our way into amsterdam even though it quite clearly says how far it is from the town and we had to get a train i just can t believe they would even build a hotel more than minutes away from the centre i also feel like i need to blame the hotel for the smell of marijuana in the city as i have no one else to blame for that as i got a headache from the smell i decided it was best to go back to my round room and go to bed i have never in my life slept through the night i m disgusted that the hotel has such comfy beds and i managed to get a full nights sleep crazy we payed extra for a champagne breakfast well if you can even call it that we had to ask for the champagne i am annoyed it wasn t waiting by the door for me on a silver tray as i walked into the room the cooked breakfast left me feeling very upset as the grilled tomatoes were cut in half and not quarters which meant i had to use the muscles in my arms to cut them up smaller
