let me start by saying the staff one in particular was the rudest i have ever come across at any stay at any hotel in any country desiree at reception would shout at us laugh at us and tell us that she will do things her own way and not the hotels way she even cancelled our room cards twice just to cause us inconvenience she is letting the hotel down immensely the hotel needs new management urgently i would not recommend this hotel at all
