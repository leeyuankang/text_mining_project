of course being closer to the city center would have been nice but as real estate prices are high this hotel found a way to make visiting amsterdam a possibility for those wanting to keep hotel prices reasonable getting a train ticket was a bit of a challenge at the metro in trying to figure out which ticket was needed to get us back and forth to the hotel pickup it would have been perfect if the hotel could sell those tickets for tourist on their own
