i initially booked for nights but i got my wallet phone cash and all of my bank cards stolen on the night i believe i had been drugged by someone with an hipnotic as the entire night was a blank and i was still having blackouts the next afternoon the police took me back to the hotel and as i had missed my flight and was in no condition to travel i asked to stay a little longer the hotel insisted that i rang my wife at home and got her to email copy passport copy credit card etc or they were going to throw me out on the street penniless i am registered disabled by the way as i have difficulties moving both arms holding things walking more than yards or so and i m due to have an operation next week to try to reduce the pain some people assume wrongly that it is alcohol or drug related the hotel repeatedly told my wife that the theft was our problem not their s and the lady called helen made it clear that she would have thrown me out if she d been working that day they had my wife in tears on more than one ocassion and i wouldn t recommend the hotel to anyone in addition the design is terribble as there is nowhere for the condensation from the shower etc to go and everything was always wet water under the kettle my laptop my mouse i was always cold as the heating didn t work and the breakfast was very expensive and of poor quality
