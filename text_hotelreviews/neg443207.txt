the personal in the bar was terrible they have a limited cartell of cocktails and they are not capable to accept simple request such as long drink also we have an incident with some pepole partying in the bar with a extremely high music volume and the personal was not capable to ask the dj to reduce the volume so we left the hotel with a terrible impression of the staff
