the shower was leaking badly so the carpet was all the time wet there was no place for the soap shower gel sponge etc inside the shower tube we put them on the floor of the shower the sink was also leaking because of the position and the table was full with water the position of the towel is strange and unusable no ear sticks or a fridge the bed sheets were never changed for days wall was full with dust we had to wait for the shuttle bus more than min to pick us up from the metro station two times and in the last day we waited more than min but they d never wait for us if we were late not and if you miss the shuttle bus which is every half an hour you have to walk it s all ok except for the nightime cause the shuttle bus is working until and we always wanted to stay late in amsterdam and it s far from the city center like now we knew that we don t have a fridge and that it s far from amsterdam s center but giving the fact that there were other problems and that the hotel is we had to mention all of it it s futuristic and different and good job for the idea but it has lots to work on to actually be a hotel
