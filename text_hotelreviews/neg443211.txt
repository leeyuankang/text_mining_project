the fact that in booking com it was stated that no deposit was going to be charged the hotel reserved a great amount of our credit card and caused us problems since at the arrival time their policy was to charge the whole amount the hotel was not clean the room floor was never cleaned during our stay and the same goes for the glass shower the rooms didnt have a window and it was very hot the temp in our room never fell from degrees the staff doing the shifts after midnight is inexperienced it seems that they are not working for the hotel but for another company offering services to the hotel this is what we were told from the morning shift staff well these were the people who caused us the problem with our credit card it was in total an experience which we didnt let it ruin our holidays for sure though we wouldnt stay there again
