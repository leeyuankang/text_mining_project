you can t open the window everything depends on the working air conditioner the room was pretty dusty there was some garbage lying on the floor when i came in first so it should be cleaned with more care there s neither a mini bar in the room nor a drinks dispenser anywhere inside the hotel to get cold soft drinks like coke lemonade from so you have to stick to the hotel bar restaurant s opening hours the shuttle service works though you should not be in a hurry but calculate with long times to wait i told the hotel minutes before i got to the station that i need the shuttle in minutes they told me to be there but when i arrived at the station they weren t after waiting about minutes i rang the hotel again to ask for the shuttle and was told it would be there in some minutes another minutes later the shuttle finally arrived and the driver told us to again wait for some minutes as he was expecting some other people after more minutes the shuttle finally started driving back so i had to wait minutes for the shuttle to drive me to the hotel though i had called to arrange it on time if i had known that before i d rather have walked the minutes to the hotel on top of that i had the feeling to not be welcome the staff at the main desc tended to just ignore me and gave me the feeling i was disturbing them though i really didn t ask for much and was very friendly the whole time they treated me like they were forced to as it was their job that was making me feel uncomfortable the whole time so i can t recommend this hotel as a place to feel well and enjoy your time
