it would ve been nice to have the towels replaced when the rooms were freshened up during our stay also we tried to arrange a taxi back after seeing beyonc in concert only to be told that that wouldn t be possible we then struggled to find a taxi that would pick us up we called for the shuttle to collect us from the metro station back to the hotel at night were told however after it still hasn t arrived and we had to call back to question what was going on eventually the shuttle came but no apologies
