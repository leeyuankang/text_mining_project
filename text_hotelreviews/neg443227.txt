the view from the room was a bit disappointing kfc and burger king the food in the restaurant was less than i expected and although the waiters were very friendly the service was not good i would suggest a more disciplined management and better coordinated service for the class of restaurant it pretends to be we had different waiters and we had to repeat same issues several times which were not brought at the end views were amazing
