the location is really bad so far from anything there was a shuttle advertised to the metro but no information was ever given about this so we didn t bother to ask and just walked instead weirdly the view from the hotel was meant to be one of the best in amsterdam or something but really is just a view over the local industrial estate and motorway even at night it s pretty terrible
