i felt the advertised pictures were misleading the rooms and the communal areas looked nothing like what i had seen online i was very disappointed with the bed in particular we had two single beds pushed together with single bedding sheets which wasn t good for a romantic getaway as everytime i rolled over to be closer to my significant other i found myself on a fairly dusty floor wedged between two very thin mattresses complete with foam toppers really did not meet my expectations by any stretch of the imagination one of my main reasons for visiting the hotel was the shower it looked different and was something i really wanted to experience however i was met with further disappointment as the shower was only partially operational for the duration of my visit the facilities were lacking in the room and in the hotel itself tv was broken towels were greyed rather than white and worn which made them feel unhygienic there is no mini fridge in the room meaning no easy access to cold drinks or refreshments the hotel does not keep basic items such as plug socket adapters at the reception desk which is something i have found in even the most basic of hotels there is a shuttle service that takes you to the tram station which is literally a pleasant minute stroll along a pretty stream the small minibus type vehicle that runs every mins was not capable of transporting all guests to the station as the amount of people waiting for it outweighed the amount of seats available all in all i was very disappointed with the hotel and would be very reluctant to visit again or to recommend the hotel to anybody i have visited amsterdam over times and this has to be the most disappointing experienced i have had with regards to accommodation especially considering the price i payed
