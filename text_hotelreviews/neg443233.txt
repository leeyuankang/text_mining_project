shuttle service runs only until pm from closest train station that is over mile away and u also have to call them which can be impossible or very expensive for international visitors no true amenities like spa or sauna just bar and restaurant location is good train ride from central station not able to enjoy late night amsterdam without incuring euro charges on taxi rides bc it is so far away ac doesnt really work at least not in our room
