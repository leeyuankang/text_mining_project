i was perplexed by the age of the linen one towel and one bed sheet had holes due usage there is no doubt that they were clean just worn the cleanliness could be improved there was dust accumulation at the top of the shower it is a hard to reach area but i noticed it i also asked for a iron and ironing board the iron was in bad shape the plastic body severely cracked and missing parts the electrical cord needs to be replaced the plate had black residue i was careful and used the iron but i would definitely recommend replacing that specific iron
