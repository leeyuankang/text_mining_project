the hotel offers a shuttle service to the metro station which is about on a dry day it is flat and walkable we used it on a number of occasions and going from hotel works well however on returning from a concert we phoned ahead to book as requested and got confirmation that it would be there at it never arrived we kept phoning and phoning and it took forever for hotel to answer to be told its not coming this is just not acceptable no apology no nothing we asked for a taxi but that never came so we had no choice to walk by this time at midnight cold and tired i have read on tripadvisor that we are not alone in this so beware a very helpful lady the next day did deduct our breakfast charge as goodwill which was appreciated hotel is far out and this needs to be considered rooms are quirky but not to everyone s taste
