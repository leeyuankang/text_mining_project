i did not like the fact that the room lacked a mini bar the hotel offers no spa or recreational area either it is more of a conference hotel than one for a leisure stay finally getting there without a car is not convenient at all there is a free shuttle service to and from the nearest metro stop but one first needs to arrive at the hotel to learn about it
