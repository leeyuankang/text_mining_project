unfortunately for us this hotel was not great the customer service was very bad on arrival we were not given an information about internet shuttle bus breakfast times place ect the normal information you should receive on check in we went to our hotel room and walked into a room that had not been cleaned from a previous guest dirty towels bed not made went back to reception and no apology just an opps they advertise a shuttle bus service every mins there is no problem getting it down to the metro but you will only be able to get it from the metro back to your hotel if there are other guests coming down to the metro at the same time you want to return the walk to the metro is minutes nice quite walk along the river if the weather is nice if not you really rely on the shuttle lovely modern hotel pity about the customer service
