the shuttle was awful they were supposed to come pick us up at pre scheduled time they didn t show up we waited and waited and ended up walking back to the hotel from the tram station a solid minute walk on of our nights sometimes with luggage or bags and when brought to their attention no apologies were given by the management or nothing was done to compensate for the dissatisfaction they did show up on time on the last night the staff was not overly friendly some were great at times though and this hotel is really far from the city center don t book here if you are wanting easy access to the livelihood of amsterdam
