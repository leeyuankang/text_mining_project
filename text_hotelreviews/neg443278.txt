when i entered into my room i discovered a very dirty towel hanging up on the artificial plant in the corner of the room as i had an appointment outside i went downstairs and informed the receptionist when i came back just before hours later i discovered again the dirty towel at the same place i went downstairs and obviously i complained a lot to a receptionist who came with me to remove the towel i have to admit that the receptionist was really professional and really annoyed by the situation
