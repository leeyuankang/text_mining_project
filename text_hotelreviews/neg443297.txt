there was no mini bar fridge which is outrageous when you pay eur per room per night we asked for some ice to the room it took them one hour to bring it they said they were too busy no breakfast included this was shocking cos when you paid really a lot location is not good at all it is so far away from the city it is unbelievable we needed to go by taxi and pay eur per way it is far away from everything you want and need rooms were dusty a little bit and there is this coffee table which is so unstable that falls down every time you touch it the sink has a weird shape which makes water go out of it and it is all over around the same with the shower water always went out and all floor was wet
