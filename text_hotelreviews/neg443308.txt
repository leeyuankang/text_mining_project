i hardly travel abroad and this was the first time with my partner i asked for a double room through booking com and was given a twin room with two beds separated i requested to change room on the first night and was told not only was that impossible but if i went to another hotel and cancelled my reservation i d still be billed so my first night of a two night stay in amsterdam i slept separately from my other half like he was my brother i will be submitting a formal complaint the staff were not to blame but both the hotel policy and booking com policy is ridiculous and ruined my stay
