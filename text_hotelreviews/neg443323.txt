staff was very very poor waited minutes in the bar and finally ordered outselfs at the bar even though staff members passed us several times and cleared tables around us had to visit hospital and nobody knew emergency numbers we returned at am and we we re declined a late check out which is possible offcourse but the same staff members showed no interest in my physical state it was a hassle for one of three of them to stand up and help us
