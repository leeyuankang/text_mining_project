rooms are so cold and without heater that one is freezing most of the time we ate the sushi in the skybar which was easily the worst we ever had too much rice rice overcooked fish was cheap and untasty and the winemenu was so old that they could not serve us our orders service took like minutes to take away the empty plates and to as whether we need something new to drink in the end we spend the money for having a nice shower at the gates of amsterdam i would definatley recommend to take another hotel in amsterdam there are also other hotels that have the open shower in the middle of the room
