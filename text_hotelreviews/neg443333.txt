i tripped in the parking lot on the way to check in i managed to cut my chin open and chip my tooth the hotel s first aid kit was pretty much a joke they didnt even have bandaids or ointment to help clean it they did help us go to the pharmacy though location is pretty far from amsterdam not many places near by either would be nice if the shuttle could come at scheduled times to pick you up from the station instead of having to call overall too expensive for location
