i had miscalculated the consequences of the hotels location i traveled by public transport and the hotel is located on a business park after office hours the route from holendrecht station to the hotel felt slightly unsafe the hotel offers a shuttle service i don t know specifics so it doesn t have to be a problem a solo walk to the ouderkerker plas nearby on a nice summer night however wasn t an option in my opinion
