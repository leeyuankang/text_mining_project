we had a very smelly room with an unacceptable view of water pipes with green stuff all over there are no fridges so we ordered an ice bucket which after the ice melted turned out to be unclean and had tissues and garbage at the bottom the rooms were not cleaned as it is supposed to be and the wifi wasn t working until we got a voucher key at the end they charged us gbp for smoking which they hadn t stated it was a non smoking hotel the bathroom spaces are horrible which we couldn t fit into the bathroom to just wash our face in the morning how are we supposed to pay a lot of money if we don t get any good service or a decent hotel room suitable for regular sized humans not skeletons i wouldn t recommend the hotel to anyone i know unless i want them to have a bad time in london
