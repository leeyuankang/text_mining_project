there was no kettle in the room you had to go to the bar to get hot water my room was very noisy it s right next to train station and it felt like i was in a war zone i couldn t have a bath as the bath plug would not close the hotel is in the middle of nowhere it has a park next door no nice restaurants or bars nearby
