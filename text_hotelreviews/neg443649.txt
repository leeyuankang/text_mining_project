the location wasn t so good we had to walk a lot just to find a coffee shop i think the nearest cafe was minutes away at schonbrunn we had to take the breakfast even if we wanted to drink only a coffee it was good but euro per person is quite expensive they do not have a la carte menu in the morning and there is nothing nearby the staff was not very helpful i found them not being so friendly with some exceptions of course last but not least when we got home we realised that the amount we had to pay for the booking was blocked twice by the pos reader so it was like practicly we paid twice
