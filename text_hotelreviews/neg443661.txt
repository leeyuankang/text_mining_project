air conditioning was not working well late spring some rooms are close to a train line it can be a bit noisy when larger trains pass by although the sound insulation is good i was able to sleep without difficulty room service was a bit spartan and inconsistent across the days i stayed there although well serviced breakfast is a bit expensive at unless one eats a lot without alternative places for breakfast nearby
