i m sad to say this but we were staying here three years ago and we had completely different experience this time let me start with the staff in the restaurant they re not saying hello goodbye they don t ask in which language they should talk to you and always start with german only after you ask them for english they switch but that only lasts until they try to talk to you again even if they were speaking to you minutes ago they do not approach your table and ask about anything and i had to shout excuse me couple of times to not be ignored now let s talk about breakfast it s true that the choice they give you is impressive what i felt is really below a star hotel is a case where pastries made on tuesday were given for three consecutive days until they were almost hard as stone cleanliness of the tables tableware wasn t perfect either i m dissapointed to a degree in which i made a decision to not come back to this hotel again there are better choices in vienna giving you the same experience for lower price oh and wifi is a joke
