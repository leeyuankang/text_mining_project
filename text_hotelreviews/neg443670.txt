one of the staff lady to be exact was so rude and arrogant i asked her for a balance to weight my luggage before going to the airport she replied fast and before i even finish my talk although another reception woman told me that the hotel indeed has a balance then when i did a check out she was mad for whatever reason then another guy came to check out and she was all smiley and all and even gave him candy in front of me and i got nothing for checking out this is disrespectful arrogant and unprofessional at all
