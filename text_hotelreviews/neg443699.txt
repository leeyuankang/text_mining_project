the gym is really big and seems new from my last visit but there are no weights and the precor machines are not great they could use a fitness consultant to set up the gym properly we ate two breakfasts and a dinner in the restaurant and it too needs some work i can always tell how a breakfast will be by the quality of the orange juice and this is no exception line is deep in the morning for the coffee machines they need to either have a filter coffee option or buy or more machines some fish would be good for breakfast and something made fresh omelettes or waffles and change it up a bit there is a lot of other choices but i would say less is more in this case have a few great things the croissants are amazing for example and not types of bread austrian food is normally great but the chicken salad was overcooked and not very tasty service is spotty these are two areas that can be easily improved but would not stop me from coming back again
