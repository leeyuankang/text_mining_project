things that could have been better on arrival our keycards were not activated for the executive lounge and on our late check out they were blocked before check out even for the use of the elevator we received a voucher for drinks in the bar except the bar was almost never open while we were in the hotel it was my husbands birthday and i requested a surprise for him the staff was most helpfull and offered to deliver a complimentary piece of cake to the room i accepted the offer but they never deliverd anything on his birthday that was dissapointing because i had not made arrangements for anything else just one more tip there is great coffee in the room but no tea a tea making facility would be great they do have fabulous tea at breakfast though
