got a room with street view was a bit noisy execitive lounge facilities were less than i expected although executive lounge itself was nice and quiet in the afternoon there was nothing left to pick up and compared to the breakfast menu it was rather poor no wine or beer not mentioning other alcoholic drinks available in the executive lounge
