unclean found a bunch of hair on a towel i left the towel on the floor to be changed and i marked it i found the same towel on the towel rail i found a cockroach in the room too expensive parking rate i waited one week for the amount of money blocked as a guarantee to be put back in my credit card account for the double room there was only one card key given therefore if only one person leaves the room the other person either remains in the dark or the first person cannot get back to the room because the elevator needs the card key to be operated for a double room too there was only one soap bar only one shower cap and only one body milk tube
