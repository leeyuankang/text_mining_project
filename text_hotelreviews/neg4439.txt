i didn t walk into the room and have the same wow factor that i had when i approached the hotel there was large circle of damp in the celling which was a little off putting the view was disgusting at night it was very noisy from the central air conditioning units ex tractor fans that ran centrally through the hotel which was our view we did ask for an upgrade but there were no rooms available we reminded ourselves that we wanted the hotel for the location and not the room
