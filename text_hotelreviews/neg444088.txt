upon checking out the receptionist a new hire i think charged me for two breakfasts euro a piece without asking if i had any the end sum sounded too much so i asked for a list of what he was charging me for when i pointed out that i had only one breakfast and none the day of checking out he said oh okay and without apologising at all removed the item i paid i was waiting for my cab when he ran after me and said he shouldn t have charged me for the room either since the website where i booked already did well i should have checked that too and they reimbursed me for the charge but to a card in another currency since they cannot recharge it on maestro so i certainly lost a few euros on that all of this is atypical of falkensteiner as i know it but it wasn t a nice feeling
