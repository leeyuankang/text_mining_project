during our two night stay in the hotel the cleaning staff managed to surprise disturb us three times with entering or trying to enter our room even when the do not disturb table was indicated the last day out of the two the cleaning lady after she was knocking on the door immediately opened it while i was just finished with showering that was quite annoying taking into consideration that we supposed to leave in the following hours shouldn t be the policy to wait until checking out
