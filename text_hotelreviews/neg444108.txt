we went to a lot of trouble to find out whether this hotel restaurant was open over the christmas period they did not respond to our emails but responded immediately when bookings com contacted them they sent sample menus and confirmed that the restaurant was open throughout it was closed on our night and we were directed to their sister hotel several miles away we had no option as most restaurants are closed on christmas eve the meal was expensive and medioca we tried our hotel restaurant again on christmas day but it was shut so we had to find somewhere else to eat
