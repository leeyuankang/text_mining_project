the hotel is located in a quiet neighborhood which is quite far if you want to walk to the main attractions you can use the bus and tram though we missed the amenities in the bathroom we only got a soap dispenser in the shower which was almost empty and was not re filled during our stay also towels are quite basic for a star hotel
