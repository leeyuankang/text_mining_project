staff the worst staff ever we have traveled the world europe asia america no hotel that we ever came across had such horrible impolite arrogant unhelpful disrespectful and snide commenting staff the front desk animals linda and sofi sophie were the worst making fun of a person who has cancer laughing at us the entire time it is my warm recommendation not to ever go to this hotel as no decor can make up for what the staff will do to your nerves literally would have paid not to stay there the next time definitely no value for the money paid also internet is way overpriced euros for hours very mediocre choice of food for the room service also we had requested parking but once we arrived linda and sophie informed us that the garage is full and that we should look elsewhere for the parking when we asked if we can park on the street next to the hotel they said it depends on the sign and after we said we did not understand german and that we would need help figuring it out they said this is not a star hotel and we do not have all the streets of this city in our head this is not the behaviour for the street let alone star hotel anyway truly disappointed and enraged really for such a disgusting treatment will do everything in my power to spread the word of how badly they treat their guests
