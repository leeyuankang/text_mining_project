there was no heat in our room so they brought in two portable heaters using both blew out the electricity after going to the front desk couldn t call because the phone was out too they came and said we could only use one heater the room was very cold all night and they didn t have extra blankets for us the next morning i took a shower since we were in a handicap room not our choice or required the shower did not have a lip or curb by which the water was contained the shower drain must have been plugged and i flooded not only the bathroom but also a large part of the sleeping room the water flowed under the portable heater of which could have electrocuted me after calling housekeeping they came and vacuumed up the excess water and had me go to another room to dry my hair no other compensation was offered or allowed when i asked horrible experience
