unfortunately the location was disappointing pretty far from the centre and from the opera state house but there is a taxi point across the street which made it somewhat fine we arrived to the hotel very early waited for our rooms for seven hours not their fault but it was expected to serve refreshments and coffee while waiting insurance payment was charged during the check in less than of the total stay it was not expected or stated for in the booking procedures
