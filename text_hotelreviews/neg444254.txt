breakfast as we are in vienna every few months we ve stayed in many different hotels around the city now we ve been to the other viennese hilton in landstrasse and the breakfast there was simply amazing so we expected the same from this hilton however the difference is huge no variety very poor selection waiters were confused and not very attentive the signs that indicated the food were mislabeled e g the cottage cheese bowl was labeled cream cheese and the the overall impression was that booking breakfast for an extra charge was a mistake despite all the pros mentioned in the plus area breakfast is the main reason we will not be returning here however you can book just the room and go eat in one of the many cafes that are in the vicinity of the hotel
