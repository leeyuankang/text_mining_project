in contrast to reception staff our experience with staff in the dining room was mixed on all mornings we had late breakfasts and found it quite annoying that staff in the dining room were on some mornings more focussed on preparing the dining room for lunch time than on our needs despite the fact that breakfast is served until for example some mornings we were offered coffee when we sat down and asked if we would like something specially prepared in the kitchen on other mornings we were ignored in our view there is certainly room for improvement despite this the self service buffet was excellent
