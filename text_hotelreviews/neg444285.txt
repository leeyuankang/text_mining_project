this was the worst value for money i ve got in a hotel a very pricey hotel with very little in return i reserved access to the executive lounge which had nothing really special to offer worst part was the breakfast it was extremely poor especially given the price i ve paid for the hotel staff needs a lot of training to deliver an exceptional experience to the customer this is a no no for my next vienna visit
