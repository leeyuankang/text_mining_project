simply when i arrived at the hotel i felt that i did a mistake even my wife said on the spot that it seems like bad hotel a five star hotel however my grand room had a malfunctioning door which you cant open from outside once closed never had this before in any hotel asked them times to come and fix it a star hotel however they forgot to put the red sheet and the red pillows on the bed which complements the decoration of the room in the first night so when i first entered the room i felt there is something wrong not like the photos in the website a totally white bed which feels odd due to what they forgot to do in before my arrival bad value for money one of the worst views i have ever had even though my room was a grand room a view on the side small street which i paid extra in to have better room than usual big grand room but feels empty you don t feel the wow effect at all one of the worst breakfasts ever no variety one main thing they are missing is the greens salads no greens i tried the breakfast for one day then canceled it when checked out the front desk didn t even ask how was your stay tv system is good however the extra stuff they have in their entertainment system like movies which are not that new is not free like for example the system in address dubai mall which totally free
