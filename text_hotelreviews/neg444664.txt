i would have expected more from a star hotel especially at the price i paid the room was significantly small appliances were generally outdated i hadn t seen a crt tv since quite some time the furniture finishing looked very strange and in general didn t seem to match the room style i don t know about the other rooms but mine had a window in the hotel s facade all i got to see is a bank on the other side of the road i d have closed an eye on this but breakfast although varied only offered a mostly international selection of foods i couldn t spot anything austrian viennese all in all i m quite critical because i ve had better service in the past with cheaper star hotels this one hotel didn t make it up to or exceed my expectations which is the point of a star hotel
