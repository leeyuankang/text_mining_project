before on my first morning at the hotel a male cleaner simply walked into my room without knocking i am female and had just finished getting dressed i asked the desk politely to ensure that he knocked in future before on my second morning the male cleaner simply walked into my room without knocking this time i was not so polite and according to the desk any problem was really all my fault as apparently i should have put a do not disturb sign on my door i don t usually do this before in hotels in the event i was totally uncomfortable at that hotel i told the desk i would leave the sign on my door permanently as i did not want the cleaner coming into my room again at all so he did rather well he got away with not cleaning my room for days and i made my own bed hardly what one expects in an allegedly five star hotel also the fridge didn t work so there was no hope of enjoying a nice cold bottle of water i didn t mention this to the desk until i left because i felt so unwelcome after their response to my experience with the cleaner one final point the minute you walk into the hotel they charge you for the full stay this is fairly unusual
