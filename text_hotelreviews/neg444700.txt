i had to stay a day longer in vienna and the hotel at which i stayed was fully booked i moved for one single night to this property the single room i received was tiny and facing a courtyard with a wall very near to the window and pipes it was not very inviting and the furnishings seemed a bit worn the room was near an elevator and i could hear people coming and going the bed mattress was not very comfortable i imagine other rooms were much better
