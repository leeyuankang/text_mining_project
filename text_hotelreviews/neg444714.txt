the hotel is old so some of the facilities reflect that i e very slow draining bathtub old fashioned toilets no window or working ventilation in the bathroom and the tv was a bit old but these are small things and did not detract from the wonderful stay we had and they all worked just don t expect ultra modern at this hotel but that is part of its charm
