very very old and outdated hotel and needs to be totally renovated especially the rooms very very low quality and not deserve more than two stars in the best rating very old rusting and dirty bath room and my wife refused to touch anything or to get shower in this outdated shower bed was horrible separated mattress with very cheap quality and single size blanket not covering all your body and very old disgusting pillows the tea set is very dirty and the mugs and spoon have remaining coffee on it which let my wife vomit tv may be thirty years old and no two star hotel accept to use it overall the rooms need total renovation and the best idea is to keep this historical building as a museum about early twenty century style breakfast area is very smelly and very crowded
