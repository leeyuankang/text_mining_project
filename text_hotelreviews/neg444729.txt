breakfast was awful dissapointment booked the hotel based on information from booking com about menu at buffet breakfast and other reviews non of them were truth we ve been at hotel during easter holidays so promised salmon they changed for herring herring with fresh onion i wonder do they realize how disgustingly it smells asked a waiter about salmon he just shortly said no no pastries only fruit cake and some basic backery all is cold and not fresh nothing in the breakfast menu worth positive comment everything is really mediocre sparkling wine is low quality very sour just a vinegar waiters at breakfats are like at the beginning of their internship like a first day purposelessly walking through the restaurant tried several times to take my plate when i wasn t finish yet no apologize no question they just simply come and put their fingers on my plate several times i have seen some managers of restaurant hotel at breakfast but none of them asked guests if we like the food at easter absolutely nothing in the menu was changed expect backery there were even less quantity than before so plates contained only several pieces miserable so restaurant and reception are like two different worlds in this hotel if you are not breakfast addicted like i am then i would recommend to take this hotel and ask for room it was clean spacious and good bed
