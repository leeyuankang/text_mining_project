we booked a superior double but got the maids closet instead the tv was old and mounted feet high on the wall the room was dark and not as described nor did it remotely resemble the room in the sample pictures we had to pay extra for the room we actually thought we had booked based on the write up and picture they claimed it was the next category it was terrible the staff was rude just like all the locals so at first we were startled but then got accustomed to it since everyone in town acted the same way we did have a flat screen tv but am pretty sure it was generation flat screen as it too was old they advertised ac but it was not turned on yet promised to turn it on the next day but it was still not working
