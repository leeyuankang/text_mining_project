it s not an issue with the hotel but needs to be mentioned for future guests we watched a lot of rudeness from guests to staff guests to guests especially in the breakfast rush people were taking others guests tables then refusing to move even though they were siting with that persons mobile phones bag and even breakfast old ladies were snarling at each other we saw a pushing incident it was disappointing to see and made breakfast really awkward maybe eat breakfast out
