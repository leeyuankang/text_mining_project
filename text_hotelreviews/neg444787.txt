the heating was off which suited us and the radiator could easily be turned on if needed but there are hot water pipes behind the curtains which made the room very hot and stuffy the ac is turned off during the winter so you had to open the large windows to get any air but of course you then had high winds blowing them open or else bumping shut unfortunately this and the typically continental small quilts would probably stop us returning to this hotel despite all its other positives
