money for hotel was pre purchased from my card but during checkout girl in reception tells me that the only way is to purchase money once more and then cancel the old pre purchase transaction which can take up to weeks so my card should be charged twice for weeks after we argued with her minutes her colleague came and did everything correctly just accepts pre purchase during several minutes
