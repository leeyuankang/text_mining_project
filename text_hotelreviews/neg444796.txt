based on the price we didn t expect a hotel it feels more like a modest one i d still recommend for the management not to claim being so far away from standards of a hotel though it is quite typical for vienna hotels to be a bit worn out i d recommend to keep an eye that this noble ageing does not tend to become a ruin some things need to be refreshed upgraded etc please do not use rattan furniture in the rooms this is something for the garden please invest more efforts in room cleaning window curtains and windows once white were clearly gray and full of dust such dust can be collected over more than year of poor cleaning it would be nice if slippers are placed already in the room upon arrival making extra effort to get them from hotel staff does not add you any points
