everything about this hotel was disappointing old furniture could see the paint and polish coming off old wall paper single beds were joined together which was extremely uncomfortable this is not more than a star hotel the pics of the rooms on the site are misleading as the rooms don t at all look like shown in the pictures this hotel needs a refurbish badly very disappointing and not worth the money spend i wouldn t recommend this hotel to any one felt like a student accommodation to be honest my wife was very disappointed by the room which was embarrassing for me and also the tv in the room was from century never seen such furnishing in any of the hotels i have stayed during travelling big mistake
