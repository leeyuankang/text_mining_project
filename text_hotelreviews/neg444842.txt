the fact that this hotel is rated is one of the biggest hoaxes i have seen in the last ten years nothing about this place is not even remotely the rooms look shabby furniture and wooden paneling are old scratched faulty or broken bathroom is about as bland as a motel bathroom breakfast are looks like a cantine food is of low quality at the opposite of what one would expect of a touted slippers were not provided we had to ask three different people in order to provide a pair wireless is slow and signal is poor save yourselves a lot of energy and avoid this place unless you want a motel like accomodation sold as five star
