i stayed in single room i felt so stuffy becuase it has a very small window there is an air conditioner but i didn t feel like using it becuase it looks old and so i wasn t sure that the filter was clean a toliet and bathroom are separated the toilet without a washstand is close to the entrance door of the room and the bathroom is inside the room that s strange so i couldnt wash my hands right after i did my business i had to open three doors the toilet door room door and bathroom door to wash my hands i felt itchy when i got into bedding i have no allergy i think bedding was not washed or kept appropriately so there might have been some ticks on there it was unpleasant
