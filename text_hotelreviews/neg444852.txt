this is not a start hotel and i am quite disappointed it is shown as such in booking com the room was small looked old older than that horrible tv hanging from the wall mount even worse there was a distinct smell in the room like humidity or some sort asked what can be done about this and was told whether i would like to have a member of the staff to drop by and spray something eventually i left the window open as much as possible on top of that there was some noise coming from the plumbing or similar not sure what was that but the ceiling and walls were noisy in the middle of the night didn t enjoy that either large variety in breakfast however i was disappointed with the quality e g the vegetables looked old dry the coffee mediocre the wi fi was bad one of the slowest ones i had to use in a hotel in a while keep in mind these points are to be compared to the start rating of the hotel
