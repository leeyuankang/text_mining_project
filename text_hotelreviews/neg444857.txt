the reception staff are friendly and very professional however the bar staff looked grumpy as did some of the waiting staff in the morning the main bar was closed for the months of july and august and the range of beers spirits and mixers was poor the pillows are really too soft and flimsy i had to double them over twice to even get a surface to sleep on offer harder more supportive pillows and i d have little else to complain about
