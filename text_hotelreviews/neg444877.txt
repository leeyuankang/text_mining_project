when we arrived i noticed that there was construction going on right in front of the hotel as it turns out the attendant put us in i don t like being on the first floor and asked for another room he then said i do have another room on the third floor how about looking at both and choosing so we looked at which had a view and an ear to the on going construction i said no to the third floor as the view was to the back of another building and the room was very small so the front desk man told me in order to get a better room i d have to upsell upgrade which would be an extra euros a night i agreed because i felt like i had no choice it was room and was a decent room as it turns out the ac worked horribly i was sweating the whole night i did let them know the next morning that the ac wasn t cooling the room at all they said they d look at it when we came back later that evening no one said a word about the status of the ac i assumed it was fixed sure enough the ac was not fixed we were miserable again the upside they did refund me the in euros that i was asked to pay to upgrade overall the hotel seems pricey for what you get
