we were shocked to find upon arrival that the reservation was cancelled by the hotel not by booking with no reasonable explanation to our luck the room was still available so no harm was done but it could be a lot worse no explanation was given to the cancellation be aware and check with the hotel before arrival room decoration is old fashioned but very clean and well maintained
