it was very hot in the room we went to reception to ask if somebody could check the airconditioning because it didn t seem to work we heard that the airconditioning was not functional yet because it could still freeze this time of the year when i booked this room it said it had airconditioning it s misleading our room was at the streetsite so it was not an option to open the window at night because of the noice we both slept very poorly for nights because the room was to hot and bad matrasses i would not recommend this hotel if it comes to comfort
