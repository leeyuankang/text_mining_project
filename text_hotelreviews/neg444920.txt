first impression from the room was definitely worse than expected from star hotel photos are very improved comparing to what you get in reality the tv was maybe years old not flat screen the bath doors were hard to open wifi was not working properly too crowded with tourist groups a bit far from main attractions and music halls room service was very unfriendly and pushed a lot because of min late checkout
