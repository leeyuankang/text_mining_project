this is not the star hotel it purports to be it is very tired and badly in need of an update our room had the smallest bathroom and loo we have ever seen at least the shower worked and was hot the tv was an antique and should have been taken out of the room years ago the bar was quite nice but expensive and the meal we had on the first night was not good and wines were very limited in choice and the one we chose would make a euro vin de pays seem good which at euros was a steal from us had we booked a star hotel i would have been happy but star no way
