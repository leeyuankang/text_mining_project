i booked a superior single room but i got a room with two separate beds which puzzled me a bit and there were no slippers in my room although they were mentioned in the room details also i think the price for the breakfast is unreasonably high but the service and staff in the breakfast area were very helpful and efficient so i have nothing to complain about in that respect
