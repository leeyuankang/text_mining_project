booked similar rooms but received different rooms as surface asked for a room change and was denied due availability after they told me that i got upgraded for one room but they were not convincing as there was no way to sort it out and didn t want to litigate i accepted the situation it was one night only even if it would have been true their statement the way they msnaged the issue was not convincing and i left with the impression i was actualy downgraded on one room and not upgraded regardless of this incident hotel is nice a bit dated but nice
