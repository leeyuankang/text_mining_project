didn t like having breakfast downstairs due to main dining area full which meant we had to go up and down stairs carrying hot cups of coffee tea then go back up and down a few times to get the food fresh fruit cereal then back up for hot selection then back up if you wished toast pastries etc by which time coffee was cold and to be honest couldn t be bothered bedroom was tired looking esp for a superior room thought it quite small no mirror in bedroom husband had to wait until i had showered hair dried and make up on in bathroom before he could shower temperature in room uncomfortable too soft pillows personal comment
