i was in a short visit to viena due to a medical issue i was with my daughter years old the personel at the reception was nice at check in nothing special when entered in my room the tv a very old one by the way was on my daughter started to look for a disney channel hard to believe but on channels or something there were porno scenes it is correct that there was a pay channel and there was some interogation menu on screen but it was absolutely transparent i was absolutely shocked about they ignorance it was in the afternoon in romania audio visual law it is very strict it seems that at hotel de france kids are able to acces such channel in a split of a second crazy ignorance i was asking for a wake up call at unfortunately an old interphone system does not allow you to call direct to the reception i asked later and they told me that i have to call like a regular call i asked for a wake up call at i was in the room preparing for breakfast there was no call and now the funny part when i checked out they asked me about the minibar the answer was negative but before i was preparing to leave the reception they said oh mister you have to pay euro for your call you called in town they maybe wanted to say you called us because the stupid system does not allow an internal call you call us for a wake up call we forgot to give you the wake up signal but you stil have to pay i am not a professional in the hotels rating but i would give a stars the main advantage is location in viena and bonus you can get some porn too
