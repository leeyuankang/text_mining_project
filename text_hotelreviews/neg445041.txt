wifi set up was unusual and rather awkward to have to use a different password every hours the wifi arrangement was not explained at check in we overheard how to use it from another guest s discussion and figured it out ourselves not only that but several of the passwords timed out before the time specified when we signed in which was just annoying other than that we were happy with the hotel and would stay there again
