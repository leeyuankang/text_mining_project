we arrived to vienna on a friday and it was soo hot unfortunately the maintenance of the air condition is not top priority at this hotel so we couldn t sleep the first two nights it s outrageous for a stars hotel not to be able to offer a well airconditioned room but the appliances are so old so even if they work they don t function as they should i suggest that the management needs to change the air condition appliances if they want this hotel to be considered a stars
