location not too close to the city center as mentioned in the reviews staff very rude and not helpful cleanliness we found ants in the room ranking the hotel is way beyond a five star hotel i ranked as a star hotel i will never recommend this hotel to anyone value for money the hotel is very expensive compared to what it offers
