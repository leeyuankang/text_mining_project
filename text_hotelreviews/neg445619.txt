hotel just wasn t even close to the standard i expected from the price waited minutes trying to call room service to have water brought up called reception and the girl said we don t have room service so you will have to go the restaurant and get it yourself not the hospitable answer for sure and hotel overall smelled funky especially lobby area and elevators had a really mediocre meal in the upstairs pricey restaurant and fortunately they removed it from the bill beware that pool is tiny and cola with very limited seating area design and price attempt to establish this hotel as high class but service and food says otherwise
