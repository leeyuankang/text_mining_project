booked superior double room for extra space and got a small room lighting was poor and air conditioning did not work staff and service was particularly poor the hotel has a pool on roof terrace which tempted us to book this hotel but the surrounding area only had enough room for around to people so would not recommend booking this hotel if looking for pool facility as insufficient for number of people in hotel we were looking forward to using the pool area but did not get the chance as no room food and drink also very expensive
