we were on our honeymoon and had asked to be picked up at the airport our flight was delayed and so we called to let them know the new arrival time but when we arrived there was no car and they said as the couldn t get in touch with the airport they didn t send a car we had also asked for a chilled bottle of champagne to be in the room and again this didn t happen when were at the pool we went to the bar to get drinks and were told not to worry someone would come over and take our order no one arrived so we went back to the bar and ordered these drinks did not arrive in the end we went back to bar and cancelled the drinks as by this point we had been in the pool for an hour
