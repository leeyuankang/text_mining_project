extremely poor air conditioning in the hotel we had to change the room because the air conditioner was not working the staff actually suggested we open the windows as the ac is not too strong the staff told its a general problem faced by many guests after we returned to the hotel on the first evening we found our room had not been made up that left us unimpressed overall it s not worth the money you shell out for your stay
