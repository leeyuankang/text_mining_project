i had two meals in the restaurants the chicken with morels and rice was disappointing it was cold in the middle although it was cooked through which suggests that it was precooked rather than being cooked to order rice was easycook rice like bits of rubber i think this was what made me ill i suggest you go out to eat you ll probably get a better experience of viennese food i was a single occupant of a double room which was very nice with separate toilet but shower was in the room closed in by glass blocks very nice but not suitable unless you are a couple
