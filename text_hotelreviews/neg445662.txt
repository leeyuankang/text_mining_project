totally overrated if true that decoration wise the hotel is simply beautiful it is not understandable that in my room believe there are bigger rooms besides not existing a closet we had in total hangers for long stays forget it hotel despite a great rooftop restaurant does not offer room service breakfast in room no desk or some sort of place in the room where to leave your suitcase you d better have only one piece of luggage or even put your laptop if you need to work a bit
