time in my life to see a star hotel with no lobby if you wanna receive someone from outside or a visitor you either take him to your room or to the restaurant which occupies all the ground floor the reception is small and located in a small corner the roof of the room is not decorated and you see the concrete above your head u get a feeling that you are in a factory not a hotel no iron available in the room no coffee maker the staff in the floor restaurant are not friendly at all especially at the breakfast time for instance no coffee machine there and you have to ask them to bring you which is still fine however when you ask them while taking your stuff they say rudely go to your table and someone will come to you there one day i finished my breakfast before someone come to take the order for the coffee
