no own parking garage which is strange for a star hotel official photos do not match to reality a room was extremely small tiny and dark very noisy outside if you decide to open your window for a night integrated building highlight forces you to close the window blinds no bathrobes provided which is also strange for stars we have found empty bottles from a previous guest in our room it says smoking is prohibited everywhere but people were smoking on upper terrace not that nice when you try to enjoy your meal no way to order a coffee for dinner only espresso wanted to try a swimming pool upstairs but decided not to do that empty dirty dishes around empty bottles a pool is designed to serve one person only our first stay in vienna very disappointed
