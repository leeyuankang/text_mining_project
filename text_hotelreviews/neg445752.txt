the top floor restaurant offered very poor selection and the tiny was a huge thick chunk totally uncooked cold interior and not pink as discussed the quinoa was sloppy inedible the alternative fish was teeny over cooked and poor the meat option was described as sliced beef marinaded in veg i would have liked a perfect filet or a lovely fresh sea bass the amuse bouche was delicious ceviche of prawn which i would have loved but was not available as a starter the wine portions are teeny and expensive the wine in the room was i drinkable cheap sweet red i left it you really need a real cook bar to hang out in and meet people ground floor resto is very starchy and not cool or interesting like hotel
