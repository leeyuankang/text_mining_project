unfortunately my son became ill in vienna we had to extend the hotel room despite telling the hotel why we were extending in rebooking nights in we were asked to leave due to the illness not only that the hotel manager refused to speak to us directly using our insurance case manager as a go between i would not recommend anyone stay at this hotel if you value service
