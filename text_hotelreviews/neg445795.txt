important not a star hotel yet they just want to be currently unrated doubt they ll get it though bad service levels can t get any food after midnight not even room service a pre requirement for a star friend arrived late they weren t able to produce even peanuts we brought her wraps from mcdonalds the waiter refused to give us plates to eat had to argue with him sat in a bar until drinking waiter kicked us out explaining he s been working since the morning and really needs to go bar does close at but who kicks guests out in a star especially complaining about how hard he has it swimming pool is a joke size of a larger jacuzzi no wardrobes in rooms only bars to hang hangers on not sure what one does with underwear sweaters etc main light in room hardwired with reading lights can t read in the bed w o having the main room light turned on simultaneously wth overall they are pricing for stars but are far from it except for location and first impression
