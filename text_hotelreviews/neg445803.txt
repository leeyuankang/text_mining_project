no privacy in the bathroom i travelled with a friend and having no doors on the shower room was unusual and unnecessary no drawers or cupboard space nowhere to put clothes but on a couple of hooks and hangers probably ok for a business person on a one day trip not for a longer five days in our case tourist stay just awful no complimentary tea or coffee would be nice to have no twin beds staying with a person who is not a partner can be a challenge
