service the check in took too long we booked a suite and it was totally different from the photo on the web site it was much smaller and with totally no view while we were in the room some people stormed in without even knocking when they saw us they said somethings that the manager wanted to show some guests the suite can t you think of calling and asking if we were comfortable with that or at least knock and ask if you can come in the breakfast is poor the whole service is awful
