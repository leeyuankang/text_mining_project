i didn t like the lighting in the room at all it hurts the eye no wardrobes in the room the sink is in the middle of the room not in the toilet the room is extra hot and they couldn t do anything about it so we had to sleep with window opened in february no brochures in the reception unlike all the hotels that i stayed in vienna but when i asked about it they got me from inside the reception team lack info about the programs in the opera so we couldn t take any recommendation most of the rooms are facing an under construction building so it s noisy when u sleep with workers working from am but we managed to move to a quieter room and the staff were very helpful the showers doesn t have a place to put the shampoo or soap or even the eyeglasses so u have to put in on the floor we ordered a coffee in the room so the room service said that we can prepare it gor u and u pick it up from downstairs how come a stars hotel without a room service no conditioner or bar of soap in the room shampoo and shower gel only
