having taken note of comments on trip advisor which complained that the rooms were very small and lack of cupboards for clothing we decided to upgrade to business class when we arrived however the room that we were taken to was very poorly arranged with the shower opening straight onto the bed no cupboard or wardrobes and looked out straight onto the building works taking place behind it was also appeared very cramped i rang reception to say i was surprised that the room was so small since we had upgraded to business class we had to wait over an hour till someone came back to us we were shown another business class room which had a much better arrangement of furniture shower and washing facilities please note that the washbasin and shower are not separated off as implied in some websites which state that there is a bathroom there is not only the toilet is completely enclosed this room had a much pleasanter view so we went with it and it was fine for two nights as we were out most of the day however there was nowhere to lay out clothes only some hangers on protruding rails the other thing that could be improved was the lighting system if you turn off the light switch by your bed all the lights in your room go off so it is not possible for one person to read at night with just their own bedside lamp on there may be a way to arrange this but we experimented a bit with the light switches but could not work it out so left it these weren t major issues for us but i would expect a bit more from a hotel that is described as star
