this brand new hotel while in a location is a hotel it is like a nice clean holiday inn express among the ritz four seasons and st regis room was minuscule shower is next to bed literally you can get out of bed and step into the shower no privacy there the building is new and sterile no charm it s too bad you can see the top of the line touches and realize was spent but it is nowhere near the quality and luxury of a hotel
