a minor gripe was i found the bed to be too firm for my liking like lying on a park bench but mattresses are so personal you ll never please everyone major gripe was the glass shower opening direct into the bedroom i had taken my mother to vienna for a long weekend and was sharing a room with her weird and awkward i would send her to sit in the toilet while i hastily showered i suspect all rooms are like this and while they may think it a design feature it s hugely impractical if you re sharing a room with someone other than your significant other overall we agreed the hotel lacks soul and atmosphere in some small part that may be because it s new but the absence of interesting art on any wall no music playing softly in the foyer or rooftop bar and no flowers or anything green anywhere all makes for a somewhat stark environment this wouldn t solely deter me from staying of course but just interesting also note they do have a rooftop bar bistro pool as well as downstairs restaurant they didn t us this at check in and no info in the room about facilities room service offering etc
