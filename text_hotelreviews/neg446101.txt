this review is specific for classic room which we booked the room was very small and felt cramped there was water blockage in shower and it was so small you couldn t move properly the staff was always missing from reception desk and nobody picked up our calls we didn t enjoy our stay at the hotel the only good thing about the hotel is its location but then again that can be said about other hotels in the vicinity and chances are they will be far better than this on winter terms of facilities avoid
