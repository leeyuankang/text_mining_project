the windows in some rooms are not opened sometimes happen some problems with hot water the reception is closed from till and the entrance in hotel in this time is possible only with card key so if you loose your key on the street or if something else happens with this key just don t work you risk to spend your night on the street i don t know maybe receptionist is still in the hotel at night and he just has the right to sleep but this moment makes me afraid about the keys all the time i was out of hotel
