no kettle available only a percolator for tea making facilities which was not ideal as the tea does not taste good when made through a percolator not enough tea also so i bought my own tea bags only a small thing but important to tea drinkers who don t like coffee no view from our room as the room was in the attic but this didn t spoil the visit
