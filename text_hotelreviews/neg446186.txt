it wasn t communicated to us that breakfast was not included in the room fee even when we specifically asked about it we went down late and had only a small coffee slice of bread and a pastry in the windowless basement before heading out to explore when checking out we were informed that breakfast was euros each which is completely nuts for what it was thankfully we were waived the bill in the end but it put a bit of a damper on an otherwise enjoyable stay
