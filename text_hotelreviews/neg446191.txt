although hotel had plenty of time for preparing the rooms we didn t checked in until evening our rooms had missing towels and it took a while till we get them later we learned that our minibar had missing pieces while checking out though it didn t cause a trouble thanks to the reception also more spacious room was given to single guest while the smaller one was given to the couple there was no double bed in any of the rooms and the single beds put together were not put together tightly so it was impossible to use them as a double bed
