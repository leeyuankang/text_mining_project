the hotel rooms are on the roof floor thus there are no normal windows only roof windows so you feel a bit like in a deep well the corridors leading to rooms are long and narrow like a labirynth claustrophobic since the rooms are on the roof floor during sunny days usage of air condition is neccessary but the air condition is either freezing or not working i was charged of the payment just on arrival before i managed to put my suitcase on the floor but on departure the reception lady was traying to charge me ones more with additional of the fee thanks god i had a print from visa proving i paid all on arrival moreover the reception staff was unable to prepare a bill for me really odd the breakfast menu raher poor and plastic coffe terrible breakfast not worth its price at all
