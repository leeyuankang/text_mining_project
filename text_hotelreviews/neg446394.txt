i booked a romantic weekend with my wife for nights first they got us a room with beds despite my request on king size and the double beds are very small then they had us wait hour despite being already to move us to a terribly small room with awful view but king bed i requested again a better one we saw the new room which looked nicer but we waited in front of it for to wait for keyes eventually i went to get them myself once in the room we realized this was a handicap room which ruined our totally we had to go to the opera so i didn t request another move i went down to express my disapointment with someone more senior and a lady stephanie helped out and told me she will move us to a better room but tomorrow as they are fully booked she was very kind but that was about the only positive thing about this hotel once we were back we had a hand written note with a very bad bottle of wine the next day we did get our room which we were supposed to but i must say the interior is very tasteless the hotel looks as it has only stories but that is for the facade in the back they made extra floors and the result is small and low rooms i could literally touch the ceiling we found out from friends that this used to be mandarin oriental and you can see they saved on renovation and the interior is a tasteless lack of concept worst than airport hilton hotel not worth the eur a night i don t recommend
