hard to move with a stroller as there are stairs in the reception even though there is a special small elevator for disabled to move to reception from the main entrance but it is inconvenient and slow also there are stairs before our room which we had difficult time to deal with the price is little bit higher than expected the suite we stayed in does not have a separate living room with proper door especially when you have kids sleeping in the living room you can not lock the toilet door it is a normal sliding door
