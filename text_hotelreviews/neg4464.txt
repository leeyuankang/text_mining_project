we booked a suite intending that our young child would sleep on the sofa bed in the event it was too small and we asked that it be replaced by an extra bed this request was declined on health and safety grounds which appeared implausible an alternative but smaller room was offered with an extra charge for an extra bed which did not address the reason why the junior suite had been booked in the first place
