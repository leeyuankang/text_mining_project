we were excluded from the top floor outside terrace bar on our second night and when returning to the hotel for a nightcap there was nowhere for us to go made a fuss and we were taken to a table in the restaurant why they didn t just send us up to the members club lounge i don t know the public areas were private function and the cigar bar had no appeal the roof terrace was closed five star hotel with nowhere to go on the plus side when checking out all our drinks had been given free of charge after making some valid comments to the duty manager
