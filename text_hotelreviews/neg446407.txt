housekeeping was hit or miss first day my very obvious dirty towels were spread out on the counter and all my cosmetics had been moved onto them another day my cosmetic bag which was hanging on a hook had been zipped up causing my products to leak there wasn t even a need for this to be touched as it wasn t in the way of cleaning it was very disconcerting
