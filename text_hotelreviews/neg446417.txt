while the service was generally attentive it wasn t more nor less than what one could expect from a regular five star hotel prior to our arriving we indicated that it was a special occasion for us but didn t receive any word on this and nothing was done with it soulless lobby lounge akin to a regular star hotel xmas decorations in the hotel lobby and public areas were woefully minimal none of the christmas spirit expected for the season was present key cards didn t work consistently on the elevators location is uninteresting still minutes walk away from the more vibrant albertina museum area restaurant personnel at the in house dstrikt restaurant were too informal and overly familiar with guests felt like a mid tier washington dc steakhouse with high tier prices
