if this didn t happen then i would rate the property as the time i arrived the hotel i was given a different price for my total stay with an increase in money for each night it is a different price than when i booked at booking com i was told that it is not an option and the total price has been changed i was also told that it was mentioned in booking com however i always use booking and never saw such a message before and never had this kind of experience
