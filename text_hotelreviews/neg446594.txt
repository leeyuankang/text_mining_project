beware of making reservations in this hotel via internet bookingcom as there is a risk you will not get the room you reserved as it happened with me and my family the explanation of the front desk attendant was that the hotel provides the best rooms in category to their regular guests who books rooms directly by phone or e mail all others who use internet will get the worst rooms in spite of a fact that we stayed in the hotel twice before at the beginning we were proposed a room in the other part of the hotel which definitely needs renovation and looks very poor for the money hotel was going to charge us after our refusal to stay in it the front desk man suggested we leave the hotel and go somewhere else to look for accommodation finally he proposed a room in the main building but it was smaller than the one we booked though the cost was the same moreover the attitude and overall behavior of the front desk attendant was very rude and unacceptable for a hotel which is stars rated
