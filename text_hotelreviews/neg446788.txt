though it s clean in general but there used to be dust on the side tables that wasn t cleaned and because i have allergy it annoyed me a bit i told the reception about it but they forgot to inform the housekeeping also in one night i smelled smoking and informed the reception what i didn t like though the response of the receptionist that if it s from one of the guests she can t do anything about it despite that s there s a policy that prohibits smoking inside the property i think what should be done in such cases is to fine the person who broke the rule the smell turned out to be from outside the hotel
