we left a day early and i informed the hotel that we wanted to cancel the last day but we still got charged i think a partial fee should be taken and not all but it s not a deal breaker we got one night for euros and that s a steal in that location of town also parking was a problem but next time we ll find a better solution for the car since you don t need it
