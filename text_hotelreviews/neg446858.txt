very disappointed with standards of accommodation at the hotel although a friendly staff this is a very tired run down hotel with a beautiful misleading fa ade exterior and a disappointing decaying interior made of cheap old fashioned dated and poor quality furniture and fixtures the rooms look like they have not been decorated in years shabby furniture impersonal decorations without the slightest taste no class at all somehow this hotel still has a rating which was probably justified some years ago now in my opinion a rate would be even too high prices of course are those of a class which make this hotel a very bad value for your money then we stayed here at the beginning of august the daily outside temperature was about c degrees and the best we could have in the room during the night was around we discovered that rooms had no air conditioning so we had to sleep with the windows wide open air conditioning is an exclusive of the lobby floor with only a poor fan in the room we are gasping the is a safe in the room which is good the only problem is that it doesn t work with a code like of nowadays hotel safes no it needs a key ehm the key because yes there is only one key for each room and guests have to contact the reception each time the want to open the safe old good keys are really loved here like safes rooms still open with a key attached to an extremely heavy key holder which you necessarily have to deposit at the reception when going out here we are still in another era far before the time when magnetic cards will make their appearance breakfast is also quite poor the offer is definitely basic in both quantity and selection and no healthy products are proposed moreover guests have to bear the same tiring and depressing cd of old pop song s instrumental versions in order to escape from it people eat as quickly as possible
