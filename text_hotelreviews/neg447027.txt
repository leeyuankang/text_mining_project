the first night of my stay i was in a superior room directly about the subway restaurant therefore the room smelled a lot of greese i tried to ventilate the room and left the balcony door open but unfortunately it did not help the smell at all i told the staff and they apologized but were not able to move me as they were totally booked out as promised they moved me to another room for the second night of my stay
