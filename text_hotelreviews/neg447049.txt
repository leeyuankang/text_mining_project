the carpets in the corridors and in the room were an unattractive colour and design they looked fairly worn the trolleys with room cleaning materials were often left in the corridors to the rooms all day i only remember seeing them tidied away once the storage space in the room was limited only a couple of highish shelves in the wardrobe for any clothes that weren t hung up i m not sure how we would have got two suitcases into the room our fairly modest one had to nestle between our outdoor coats
