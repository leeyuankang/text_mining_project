i didnt like that the staff was short and they did end up helping us but it seemed like we were burdening them with to many questions that had zero knowledge about vienna and where to go and were not able to answer our questioned at all we followed the rateings on bookings com and have no idea what ppl saw in this hotel because it was small and dingy nothing of what ppl had actually said was true location was good but not in the best part of town u could tell by the crowds walking around it seemed a bit dirty rooms were too tiny and what we got in the room was not upto the standard of the hotel
