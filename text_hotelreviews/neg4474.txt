this hotel is starting to look very grotty carpets are stained and the cleanliness could be improved i have stayed for several years at hotel russel but having stayed in lots of other hotels it is definitely in need of some refurbishment also the shower facilities are rubbish there is not even a shelf to place your bar of soap
