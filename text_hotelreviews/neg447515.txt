we were initially checked into rooms on the floor they were generally nice but the windows were small and did not open as this was the top floor attic on the second day we had an unexpected plumbing issue with dust dirt coming through the shower in both rooms we later found out the issue was due to some construction work nearby the staff were very apologetic and we were upgraded into other rooms floor with a better view for the rest of our stay
