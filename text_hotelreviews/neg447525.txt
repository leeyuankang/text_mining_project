no bath tub which is important as i used to hv a bath after a very tiring walk for a whole day the room size is not standard i reserved two rooms one is superior double and one is superior twin the twin room is only size of the superior and i thought it is only a standard twin nevertheless i requested for a change in room and they managed to change for me on the second night despite the room size is specigied in their website superior room from sq m to m while a standard is only m it seems like quite unfair to put the m room as a superior room when we know other guest is having a m room bear in mind we paid the same amount of money
