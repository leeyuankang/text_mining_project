make sure you ask for a room at the front of the building we booked a superior room only to find that we were at the back of the hotel in a dark room with a view of a wall and refuse bins however reception staff changed our room without hesitation and we were delighted with our new room at the front of the building apparently both rooms were classed as superior but there was certainly a huge difference so make sure you get what you are paying for
