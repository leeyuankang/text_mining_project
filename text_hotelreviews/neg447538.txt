on the day we checked out there was a group of people holding posters and yelling in front of the building the taxi driver told us they were protesting they said they worked for the hotel but didn t receive their salaries we didn t know what exactly happened just felt a bit disappointed about this issue it can be seen the hotel has a high occupancy and great review scores on booking com it seems that the business is doing pretty well hope the hotel do the right thing to the workers and treat them fairly
