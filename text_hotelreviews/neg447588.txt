when arriving we had to wait at least an hour before we were fully checked in there wasn t enough personnel to help us in an efficient way one lady was putting in our personal details and all of the sudden she was helping someone else after a while we told them that we wanted to take up our bags ourselves because there was no bellboy available but they wouldn t let us result very tired and difficult children when checking out again we had to wait a long time before we were being helped we were stuck in the hotel untill noon after we complained and told them we were not happy they did try to make up for it in one room there was no daylight it was situated in a very dark ally an expensive hotel and i thought that we would get more value for money there are hotels in milan that offer a better service that in the same price range
