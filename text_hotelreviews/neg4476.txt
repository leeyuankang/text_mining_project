we booked a standard room six months before with the idea that we would be allocated a good one however we were given one on the floor with a tiny wardrobe small windows facing into a quadrangle and an even smaller washbasin as this was for our wedding anniversary we were very upset and complained the response was excellent and the replacement standard room was so much better management gave us a bottle of champagne and a cake to celebrate our anniversary pity we had to complain though
