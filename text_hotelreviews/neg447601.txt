the room was small for a double there s no real seating or desk if one wants to do some work the air conditioning was very noisy on the first night but that was fixed by turning it down not really needed in october but i guess this could be a problem in the summer breakfast was not included in the deal i chose but was reasonably priced on hotel standards however was fairly standard fare the gym is small and rudimentary only one treadmill for e g no iron in room overall this is a nice hotel but really not what i d expect for over night
