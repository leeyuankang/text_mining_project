it would have been better or helpful to have a list of good restaurants from michelin rating to just good value for money we only had one chance to have dinner in milan and requested for one of the best restaurants to be booked not their fault perhaps it was the best to them however recommended us to a place wherein staff were great but the food and value were not bella italia would rate excellent compared to this on both counts wouldn t mind paying much if it was worth it but at about per head for course plain meal and a wine felt ripped off
