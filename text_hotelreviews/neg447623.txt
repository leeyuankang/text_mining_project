we asked the reception if they could call a certain restaurant for us to check if they were open as we noticed that a lot of places were closed during august the person didn t make an effort to call for us and just mentioned that he thinks it s probably open so we travelled to the restaurant located in the suburbs and of course it was closed it would have been helpful if he had just called for us thanks
