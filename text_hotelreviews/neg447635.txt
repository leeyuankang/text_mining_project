hadn t expected one but room had no view except for interior of some building parking not available but there is a discount on a nearby parking still costs you eur a day we asked to use the steam bath and sauna and waited for them to heat up but when we arrived the floor of the steam bath and the entire sauna were still cold after our complaint we gave it a chance and min later after staff had notified us that it was now really ready we went back to find a slightly warmer steam bath and sauna but still not heated enough so we didn t spend much time there i guess this is the only really negative point we have one of us witnessed an unpleasant discussion between the welcoming staff member and another staff member the welcoming staff member perhaps being a little too enthusiastic and not professional enough
