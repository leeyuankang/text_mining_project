there is no bar coffee facility in the hotel other than in your room minibar and kettle and the breakfast room is small so can get busy at popular times coffee tea at breakfast is via a machine not what you might expect in a star hotel and there is only one machine which does not work very quickly so did lead to a bit of a queue again not what you might expect in a smart star hotel
