if you and your family especially if you have kids prefer in room dining and would like to stay at the hotel sometimes this hotel doesn t provide this service they only serve breakfast at the ground floor kitchen but if you are always on the go you will be just fine because the area is full of cafes and restaurants within a walkable distance
