they put us in a room overlooking all the garbage the smell was awful like being in a sewer it would be horrendous in the hight of summer getting back to the room was really unpleasant because of it was terrible with windows closed and horrendous with windows open couldn t spend more time here than necessary due to the smell in our room as such didn t get to utilise the amenities i don t know what the interior designer was thinking the interiors in the actual rooms is dreadful green and orange i know that retro is trendy but this is awful at best trying too hard to be different here and haven t pulled it off i would suggest requesting a room not overlooking the bins if you stay here a great hotel but ruined by our stinky room
