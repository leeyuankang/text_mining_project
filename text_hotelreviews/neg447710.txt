staff at reception needs proper training there are so my of them literally to learn the basics of hotel business i need it to remind one of the guys that i m a pro traveller and book the hotel just because it s newly opened and would like to experience it and that i will write the review as is after big time arguments what is interconnecting room and what is main street view and backstreet rubbish bins view i was checked in hour later again in a wrong room facing the rubbish bins as an upgrade since i had requested prior to my stay a street view room i was put under ultimatum that i can either take the rubbish bins view or wait another to get a main street view room with two queens instead of king bedroom a total mess illiterate receptionist could be sometimes very stubborn and uncooperative as some of the staff at room mate guilia is i had no time to waist and opt for the view overall made me regret that booked with them since for the same price one could stay at park hayat which is just facing room mate if you are not eager to experience the hotel place your bets on well established hotels around and forget about guilia there are so many of them with a better service and less expensive they don t provide an ironing service and when you request an iron to do it yourself the answer is we don t have irons
