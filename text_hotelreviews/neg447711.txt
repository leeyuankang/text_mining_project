maybe the breakfast doesn t have that variety but it was very fine with me kind of cheese kinds of cold cuts while includes pork and ham good pastry kind of fruits butter and jams eggs and mashrooms the water takes a bit time to go worm but the main drawback of this hotel is that they don t have laundy section or even ironing as they deal with an exterior vendor and takes full day to finish and they don t offer ironing device for security purposes
