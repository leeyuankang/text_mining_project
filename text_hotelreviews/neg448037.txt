we didn t get the room that we booked we were told that there had been overbooking and we had to go into the next type of room down that meant that we had paid for a specific room but had to be satisfied with a room that would have cost euros less per night but received no repayments when i showed my dissatisfaction i was told that i had got the room at a reduced price when i booked it my impression was that the rooms had been advertised at a lower price on that day and other people might have paid more for the same room and i had to be satisfied with a room of lower quality while they got the room i was not impressed by this type of attitude and will not stay in that hotel again
