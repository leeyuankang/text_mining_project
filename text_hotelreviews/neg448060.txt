it s somewhat unbelievable that the hotel doesn t keep any irons in the entire facility to me that is simply outdated the shower area is strangely designed there s no possibility of keeping the foot towel close to the door which leads to water spillage in the bath room it s a simple issue of designing the door or the floor in a way that allows close contact between the towel and the door thereby absorbing the water from the shower
