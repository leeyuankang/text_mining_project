somewhat petty but the room could use more shelf space no clothes drawers at all the closet which had shelves was mostly taken up by a safe fridge and ironing board all of which we could have done without a glass table in the window alcove could have had some kind of dresser or desk with drawers the last two times we stayed here the rooms contained more than adequate shelf space
