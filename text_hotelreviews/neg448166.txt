shoebox bathroom which if you are taller than forget getting under the bath hairspray and if you are bigger than stone forget having a bath infact forget even getting through the shutters to the loo didn t complain found out when we checked out after expensive days that we would only have been moved to another room without canalview a family room also the receptionist said most bathrooms were this small size anyway this explained why when we checked in there were no smiley faces or welcomes just waiting for our comments i suppose we felt so unwelcome that we had our breakfasts out in local cafes it was my husbands surprise birthday trip i had organised for him and i feel very badly let down
