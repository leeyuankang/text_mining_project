the hotel is a gem service is almost perfect but just before leaving we realized my husband s blazer was missing after a transfer to a better room at the front desk after waiting for over an hour last minute shopping they claimed to be unable to find it had they believed us right away and looked harder where we suggested it would have been found right away the blazer was found shortly after our departure they are now shipping it since we are traveling it was the only dress jacket my husband had and needed today for a wedding some form of compensation should have been offered at the time a small discount or free parking for a day a small gesture for a big inconvenience
