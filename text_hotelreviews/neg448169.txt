unfortunately we did not look at room size before booking and at about this was the smallest room we have ever stayed in relative to cost the glass shower and toilet opening directly next to the bed provided no privacy and after removing cushions and pillows from bed there was a feeling of claustrophobia i am sure other larger rooms would have been better
