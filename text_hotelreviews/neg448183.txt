the breakfast was a nightmare we were given no information about how it worked it was disorganised and chaotic nobody seemed to be in charge of running it no staff spoke to guests it was a free for all it was also far too expensive at euros for two also i found being charged a different room rate plus city tax for each night very odd this was not fully explained by booking com and i paid more than i was quoted for my stay
