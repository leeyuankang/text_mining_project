but it had a very bumpy start we checked in after an all night flight from the u s and were shown a tiny room on a shaft that had construction going on in it they said there would be noise during the day this was unacceptable to us so they showed us to another room after waiting a bit that was as tiny but facing the canal we had never seen a room that small the toilet was a stall separate from the sink around the corner by the entrance door and then there was an equally tiny stall shower all about a foot from the bed we frankly couldn t believe that they were putting us in a room like that for four days having booked nearly a year in advance and at over per night they said they were fully booked but would move us again the next day they did into a much larger and elegant room which is where they should have put us to start with we complained to the management it was an unfortunate way to begin our trip especially as we were so tired and couldn t properly unpack at the start
