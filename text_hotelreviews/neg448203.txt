the bathroom was literally a small corner of the room that had been sectioned off with thick frosted glass it was not a separate room with a door the bathroom consisted of two tiny stalls one with a toilet and the other with a shower the toilet stall was smaller than an airline bathroom there was no privacy for the toilet stall the toilet was about ft from the bed and the swinging frosted glass door was open at the top there was absolutely no privacy whatsoever the sink was in the bedroom taking up valuable space in an already very small room the room was too small to accommodate people and luggage we had to move a desk chair out of the room so that we could shove our suitcases under the writing desk there was a small cupboard in which to hang a few items and there were some storage cubbies over the bed it was not unlike stowing gear in a sailboat
