very tiny room with really cheap details scratchy towels cheap tissue paper one little bar of soap that the maid did not replace i used the same one for four days bad tv service which shut down at night a rerun of the same amsterdam program which broke up every two minutes one tv news station and no local news or weather bad layout to open the one drawer you had to open the wardrobe door but it banged into the bench so you had to move furniture to get a piece of underwear the staff gave me wrong directions to dam square and i almost missed my tour then she said she was from germany and didn t know the city so why give directions many annoying details bad breakfast buffet and they didn t tell you it was in another room so you sit there for minutes waiting for a menu that never arrives no fruit served a bowl of tired grapes and some kiwi slices was all make your own coffee really overpriced at euros
