we stayed in room whilst the view was good the size of the room would be considered small had it been a single but as a double i felt it was too small there is no seperate bathroom therefore a pane of frosted glass and about inches was all that seperated the toilet from the bed for the price paid i didn t think the room size or room facilities were appropriate or value for money
