very dark room with shower fan running constantly staff said they often have complaints about the fan noise and a technician can go onto the roof to turn it off is this really a satisfactory solution to wait until guests complain some staff were bordering on officious seeming to forget you are a paying guest have previously stayed here and all was fine so hoping this is just a temporary problem to the service although will consider carefully whether to stay again
