the older guy at the reception was a bit moody and borderline rude you don t expect this sort of greeting at hotel the service could have been improved in general we are vegetarians and ordered a vegetarian breakfast the guy brought us a plate full of bacon when we explained that we are vegetarians he only agreed not to charge us for extra bacon which we did not order he did not get at all that it was unpleasant for us
