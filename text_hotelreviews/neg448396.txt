the staff were nice but not too friendly seemingly more interested in each other than the guests we got one very good dinner recommendation from one of the friendlier girls on reception at breakfast no one gave you any info making it a truly self service experience the worst bit was the bar there was only one girl serving if anyone wanted bar food she had to cook it leaving the bar unstaffed two of the three nights we have up after minutes trying to get a drink
