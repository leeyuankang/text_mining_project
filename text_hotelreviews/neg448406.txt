this is not a business hotel for sure and this should be made very clear to those who come for business transport access is not so good as railway is quite away and no tram really nearby taxi would have problems waiting for you as the street is very narrow and the there is no place for car to wait coming to the hotel at on saturday i could not get any cleaning service for one shirt until monday evening hotel staff was useless in arranging this outside of the hotel promised to help and forgot about this needed to do all by myself find i am not local at all go order and collect ceilings in the rooms are really low and most of the rooms are looking to the inside building walls and windows to have a street view and not to look into other rooms windows which are away from your own window you need to pay a fortune you can hear all what is happening in the next room or next floor sound proofing is bad facilities in the bathroom are somewhat old
