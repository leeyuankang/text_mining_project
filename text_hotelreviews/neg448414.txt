our room overlooked the back of the hotel this road was very noisy long into the night early in the morning so we didn t get much sleep for the duration of our stay there were insufficient surfaces to place things in our room just one small coffee table and dressing table and no chairs for a family of three this was not enough so most of our belongings had to be stored on the floor not good the bathroom was very tiny and again no where to put your belongings i had to store my toiletries bag on top of the closed loo seat not ideal people in the room above us also made a lot of noise but this was because the floorboards creaked every time they walked around would stay again but make sure room is not on the back of the hotel
