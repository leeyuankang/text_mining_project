the hotel is filled with travelers of a certain age mind you i am and felt like a child way too much stuff everywhere the hotel lobby is a just very old looking and needs a make over not the most inviting first impression the bathrooms are really really small more like ft ft closest internet is a mess doesn t work at all and we were told the next time you visit book directly because breakfast is free what a terrible thing to say to a customer who is checking out why not offer it up front since its included in the price when you book directly
