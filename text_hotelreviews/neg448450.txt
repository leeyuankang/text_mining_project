the air conditioning did not work well in the first room we were assigned to as well as not cooling effectively the fan was directly above the head of the bed making it very noisy after our first night we were moved to an outside room on the back of the hotel where the air conditioned worked better and the fan was further away from the bed also the interior room did not have an outside window so it felt very confining
