no major issues but it mostly had to do with the bathroom which was a bit awkward the toilet seat was high and i am tall and the shower glass only covered of the tub making it very difficult to take a proper shower without spilling water out of it the nozzle on the shower head was not adjustable to different spray settings also the meal i had for breakfast was quite poor and definitely below expectations
