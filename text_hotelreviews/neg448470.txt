breakfast we would only say good compared to star scottish hotel breakfasts the used dishes were left at the table too long and hot food was not closely monitored often needing refilled but the croissants were excellant because of the issue with our flight being cancelled i feel it would have been nice of the hotel to have a little understanding and offer us the extra night at a reduced rate
