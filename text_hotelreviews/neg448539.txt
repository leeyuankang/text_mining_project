the bathroom lighting could have been better i found it difficult to apply makeup because of poor lighting particularly in the vicinity of the round makeup mirror our room had very poor natural light we had requested a canal view and were told it was unavailable but would be receiving an upgrade we failed to see any upgraded features in this room our only window faced into a courtyard with poor natural light and also looked directly into the room feet across the courtyard for any kind of privacy we had to keep our curtains shut
