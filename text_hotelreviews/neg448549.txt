i don t normally provide feedback however this hotel is terrible the walls are paper thin you can hear the people in the bathroom going about their business in the room above walking around with squeaking floorboards hear people walking around the halls the ceiling height is incredibly low making you feel like you are in a cave the free wifi is predominantly slow or doesn t work at all the shower is ridiculously small and pressure variable at best the hairdryer may as well have been one of the staff members blowing hot air out of their mouths there is no services welcome manual in the room the decor is pretty much dressing mutton up as lamb i don t recommend it would steer clear i paid half the price at an ibis and although small you got what you paid for plus high speed internet friendly staff free breakfast and a comfortable bed
