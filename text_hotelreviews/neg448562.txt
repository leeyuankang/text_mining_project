the lift was the smallest i have ever seen and the first flight of stairs is scary for anyone with a foot larger than average size the showers were very slippery until used a couple of times and the hair dryer was a little average in effectiveness the hotel put a large holding amount on the credit card used to secure the booking and this was not released for two working days after check out this was not necessarily the hotels problem but something to plan for but the above issues would not stop us from staying there again
