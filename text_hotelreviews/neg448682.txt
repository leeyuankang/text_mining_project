rooms were tiny which was unexpected due the to pictures we were placed in an awful room at first with marks dents and scratches all over the room and the bath had long black hairs in and was so dirty our window was facing the glass elevator so we would have had to keep our shutters closed the entire time the second room we were moved to due to complaint was also tiny and the bathroom was filthy the walls are very thin and you can literally hear everything if you know what i mean the sheets aren t changed or cleaned the service is terrible and very slow they failed to inform of a number of things such as we should leave our key with the reception upon departing the hotel everyday otherwise the key deactivates itself on arrival we should have received an ipad for room service and other informative things such as tourist attractions but didn t receive this until a day before we left due to the weather being so bad another guest informed us that the hotel should have offered us one of their umbrellas on the way out and we didn t received this service once the service is very rude and unfriendly no smiles no welcome no greetings the hotel wouldn t let me use their phone to call my taxi to the airport to check where he was and one of the receptionists ordered me to use my personal mobile which would have cost me a lot of money i was in shock
