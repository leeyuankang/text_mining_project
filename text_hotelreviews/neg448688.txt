the breakfast wasn t what i d expect of a hotel good selection of fresh fruit and great breads very poor cooked selection only bacon eggs and undercooked cocktail sausages and only one cereal cornflakes and expensive at euros very small bar though it is and you can take your drinks in the foyer but it lacks atmosphere room was very small with no hanging or storage space so had to live out of my suitcase for days the small wardrobes held the ironing board and the safe minibar but it was warm and comfy
