poor pillows only one pillow each and both pillows were flat was other cushions but they were for decorative purposes only woke up with a stiff neck shower gel bottle in the shower was empty next morning took one off the cleaners trolley and put it next to the empty bottle so it could be changed cleaner took it back and left the empty one so had to pump shower gel from the bathroom one into a glass to use in the shower again cleaners need to check the levels of toiletries on cleaning rooms
