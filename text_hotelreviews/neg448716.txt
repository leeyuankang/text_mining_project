there were a couple of small criticisms about the cleanliness of our room there was a item of litter on the bathroom floor left by a previous guest which did not get removed for days when we removed it ourselves there was also a very dusty ledge in the bedroom which had clearly not been dusted for ages having said that the general impression of the bedroom and bathroom was good
