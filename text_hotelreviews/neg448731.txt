breakfast was too expensive for what is was besides the glasses and plates were really hot so my chocopasta got fluent and my oranges juice wasn t that cold anymore also for vegetarians it isn t nice that the sausage cutlery is the same cutlery as for the eggs the same for the cheese and other meat products the parking service wasn t that great as well it s really expansive you have to wait next to a coffeeshop for your car and it takes a while when your car is ready they don t drive it for you in out the parking in front of the entrance you have to walk on the street to the back of the hotel and if it rains you need to wait in the rain as well
