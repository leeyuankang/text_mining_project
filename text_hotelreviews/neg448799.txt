the breakfast was much too expensive for a marginal selection of food for euros i had to pour my own coffee while the waitress stood around acting like they were busy over priced breakfast room location poor and decor was overly lavish and room was dark shower room missed the mark and bathroom was narrow would not stay here again front desk clerk was unprofessional and not trained to answer questions turning in the key and then retrieving it upon our return to the hotel took too long old fashioned system
