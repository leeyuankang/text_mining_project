hotel is positioned as an upscale property and price and location reflect this there is something amiss in a negative old school way that business is conducted however front desk operation was inattentive young men staffers spent as much time kidding each other and winking over private jokes as they did servinfg customers one young woman staffer was cold and could offer no advice on dining or directions she seemed bothered to have been asked and not very knowledgeable i would not describe this as a warm welcoming place despite the elegant setting others may have had a different experience however disappointing given the high expextations we had room we had was quite small and had only interior view to airshaft an outside view would have been worth the upcharge though the hotel is a bit pricy to begin with
