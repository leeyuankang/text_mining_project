the double room we booked consisted of twin beds pushed together which was extremely uncomfortable and unromantic a deposit of was taken to cover any minibar items we used we opened the minibar to find two tiny bottles of still mineral water which you might have thought would have been free at night and nothing else there was no shampoo in the dispenser the saloon doors between the bathroom and the bedroom meant that any sound other than powdering your nose would have been rather unpleasant for your partner we had a drink at the real bar but they had run out of clean wine glasses it was and there were of us there definitely not the worth the price and we won t stay there again
