only negative remark would be when checking in we gave deposit for room and only got half of it back due to city tax we were not informed of this when we checked in and feel it should have been included in our overall payment when we checked in rather than being told we would get full deposit back this was very misleading also we were supposed to get an ipad with tourist information on it with room but we were not given one we were not offered this when checking in but anyone else we saw checking in on other days received one this was clearly just forgotten about for us which is understandable but it would have been a great facility to have had so we were disappointed we also had no working fan in our bathroom other than that i can t fault the hotel these issues were very minor
