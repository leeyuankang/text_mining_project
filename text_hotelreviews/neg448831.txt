some of the staff were a bit indifferent having stayed the previous year at the ambassade where every staff member that we encountered was warm considerate and conscientious without ever being obsequious the contrast was quite noticeable i also found the decor in the lobby and dining area to be a bit dark and garish again compared to the ambassade but i know that s only a matter of taste
