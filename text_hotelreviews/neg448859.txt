i had a couple of things that i felt could have been better the staff didn t have similar information on recommended tours and restaurants as in when the first check in attendant would recommend me a certain tour or restaurant and i would come back to the desk to make a reservation or buy the ticket there would be then another check in attendant who would contradict the recommendation previously given to me and would give me completely different recommendations this made it difficult for me to choose and decide as i was confused which recommendation was the most accurate it would be great if staff was trained and given similar type of information for tours and restaurant recommendations so they wouldn t contradict each other i put up a no distrub sign as i didn t like my pillow cases changed everyday however on of the days i came back and found my whole room cleaned and reorganized it was annoying as i had the sign up also some not all of the staff at the check in desk spoke to each other in dutch while helping me out even they had perfect english it made for an awkward atmosphere as it made me feel that i was being talked about i do have to note that the night staff wasn t like that and was very friendly and when i fell ill on one of the nights they were very helpful and tried to be accommodating
