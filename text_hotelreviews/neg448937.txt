the receptionist made me believe that it was cheaper to park the car in the hotel than in the street in front of the hotel this was clearly not the case and when i complaint about it staff got rather unfriendly and no one wanted to accept responsibility on top they made me walk all around the property to get to my car instead of passing through a door to the garage from where i also entered the hotel last but not least the rooms are a lot smaller than they appear on the pictures
