we checked in early in the morning and dropped our stuff at the reception when we came back to get our keys in the afternoon the receptionist gave us the keys of the other person s room in which we found personal belongings widely open etc the explanation at the reception knocked us off it must have happened due to your late check in moreover we did not receive any proof of payment or pre authorisation thus we got another room which did not have a bath tub which was displayed on the booking page the next day we asked for a cab at the reception and we got a black taxi price wise maybe it is the same thus let it be since we went to the paddington station the receptionist must have thought that we had left the hotel thus he or his colleague checked us out in the evening when we returned our keys did not work so we had to inquire to activate them because of this checking out procedure without any notice we were informed next morning that breakfast was not included into the room price anymore what a pain on the day of departure the receptionist withdrew the amount for the night meaning that we had to pay twice to the banks for the international transactions etc we were lucky as she was smart and gave us a discount of pounds we are very thankful for that but that does not change the fact that there was very poor service of the remaining part of the receptionists there when we returned to collect our stuff on the day of departure the receptionist number i do not know which was loudly discussing his points of view concerning the eu and the uk matters with polish guests who just arrived to check in he was so involved in explaining his point of being an independent islander that we were forced to listen to all that and wait when this person would finally return our belongings to us thanks to him we had to run to the dlr station
