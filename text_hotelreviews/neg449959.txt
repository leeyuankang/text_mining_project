we returned to this hotel after years based on a wonderful previous stay on entering the lobby there was staff at the reception and resting on it no one made an attempt to assist us with getting our suitcases up the curb step previously the porter came right away with a smile and a hand our arrival seemed like a great nuisance especially to the staff holding up the counter the staff who checked us in was pleasant and friendly the room was basic and we had twin beds not a double and the room we had previously was just amazing with period furniture the furniture now looks like it needs some attention the manager couldn t be bothered to even stop and say someone will be with you when he saw us at the reception but just indicated someone would be along so dismissive when we asked to settle the bill the night before we left we were told to do it in the morning we said we we were leaving at someone was always at reception is what he said later that night when i asked why we couldn t settle the bill the staff member became quite aggressive and said that was not what we were told and when i expressed my disappointment in the whole staff attitude and sadly we wouldn t return he responded well i m not viennese and neither are you so what do you care we were stunned a real disappointment
