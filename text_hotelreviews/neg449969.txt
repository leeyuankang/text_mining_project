one of the facilities listed was airport shuttle which we understood to be mean the existence of a hotel shuttle bus service that included the hotel royal as one of its stops and this was one of the reasons for choosing the hotel it turned out there was no bus shuttle and the facility only meant a taxi could be ordered through the hotel in the end we used public transport and had no problem in getting to the hotel but i feel the information given in the description was misleading the restaurant was on the pricey side
