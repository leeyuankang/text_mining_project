there was no bar in the hotel for non smokers the restaurant downstairs was non smoking but the try to clear this by and it does not have a bar area anyway the restaurant on the top floor the one with views over the city and cathedral opens later and has a designated bar area but you have to put up with the smokers who by the way have little concern for anyone else we would not consider returning to austria because of this
