the receptionist chinese looking with black hair was very negative and rude she was acting like she is not in the mood for anyone never saw her smile for nights of stay so many roles like water boiler and irons are not allowed in the room and if they were found by the staff it will be taken away till the end of the stay breakfast is very limited
