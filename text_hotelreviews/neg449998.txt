even though i payed bigger price for free cancellation the hotel charged my credit card one week before even the free cancellation period ended the hotel staff explained that the sum was blocked to guarantee the room availability then without informing on check in they blocked another euro at check in i tried to pay for the entire stay but i was told that the room was paid so at check out i lost a lot of time into clarifying all this moreover the payment system showed a different amount than what i should have payed for so i almost lost my airport bus having to run to schwedenplatz to catch it i think the hotel shoul clarify their pre payment funds blockage system with booking com since it appeared to me that i can pay upon arrival with no charges beforehand it s ok to take deposits from credit cards but the booking com reservation should state so to the clients
