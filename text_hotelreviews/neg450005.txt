the room was not as clean as it could be bathroom had some things that were clearly not cleaned and the pillowcase had fluff over it i was only given one doona pillow towel etc which i found stingy as other hotels had provided each regardless of the fact i was travelling solo the heater radiator took a long time to heat up then it was far too hot it was the loudest radiator so sleeping was a problem as it powered on when the temperature got low wooden floors meant that i could hear people stomping around in the middle of the night the pillow was flat and the bed hard so all these made for some restless sleepless nights one morning housekeeping came in to service the room butbi was still there the man knocked and just unlocked the door and barged in without even waiting for an answer the buffet breakfast that was included was very average uncooked bacon one morning then no bacon any other morning tiny glasses for juice soggy cold eggs stale pastries hotel offered booking services for tours etc enquired about airport transfer and they were going to charge euros for a minute trip and one that another company charged euro for good location but that s about it
