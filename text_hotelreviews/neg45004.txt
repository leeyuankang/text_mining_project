kitchen slow didn t come close first night we decided to have dinner there we managed to get served before a large group of came in and only waiting staff on waited for ages before dessert which definitely wasn t worth waiting for first morning we came down and someone had already used our room number which was a bit worrying there was no issue with us getting served and thankfully no issues with that the remaining days a long wait between ordering breakfast and getting breakfast not much choice for the continental breakfast fruit salads looked like they were sitting in a gallon of juice pastries didn t get topped up once they d ran out first morning we got asked if we wanted toast the remaining two mornings we didn t second morning asked for pancakes they didn t have any why because they d ran out of flour how does a kitchen run out of flour third morning ask for pancakes minutes later i don t know what was put in front of us but it wasn t pancakes more like deep fried lumps of lard which were solid and because it was streaky bacon it was more raw than crispy so first time i ve ever sent food back and then another minute wait this time for eggs benedict had eaten this the previous mornings and they were fine on this occasion i couldn t actually cut through the muffin it was brick hard so that got sent back too didn t have time to wait for a attempt at a cooked breakfast as we were checking out got back up to the room to find water dripping onto the floor apparently this is perfectly normal for the hotel as it was because we d left the air conditioning on and the drip tray was full had to say glad we were leaving and that we weren t having to put up with water coming in from the ceiling made all these comments to reception who didn t really seem to care
