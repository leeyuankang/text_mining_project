the air conditioner was like sleeping with a jumbo jet engine starting and stopping next to the bed could not sleep with it on in our daughters room the air conditioner did not work at all and the room was very hot the room also smelt badly staff changed their room the next day to an upgraded room at no extra cost the rest of the stay was comfortable
