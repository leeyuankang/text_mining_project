the room was teeny needs a refurb not great value for money but location superb strange that not even a complimentary bottle of water is given to guests as this is standard in all hotels tried phoning reception a few times to check when my bags would be brought up but no answer eventually the phone was picked up perhaps they were particularly busy at that moment no british staff at all
