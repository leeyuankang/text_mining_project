my room was tiny and the carpet smelt i didn t want to touch it with my bare feet my bathroom looked old and there was a hole in the tap section in the bath and a black mark on the bath itself the hotel is getting a little grotty i have stayed there three times and really noticed a drop in standards obviously the location is fabulous
