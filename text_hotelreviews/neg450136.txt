i had the small double room very clean and comfortable for a small room only problem was it was facing the back off hotel with a big generator under the window so didn t sleep very well due to the noise it was constant through the night so for the price of the room it was a big let down but everything else was fine would go back there but would have to have a different room not one at the back
