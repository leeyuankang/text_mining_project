the hotel was holding a pre authorisation on a credit card through booking com which is usual and took a second pre auth from a second card when we booked in and then insisted that we pay in full for the nights in advance very poor hotel management decision and we did not experience that anywhere else all other hotels we stayed in took a pre auth on the credit card and then we settled the account at the end of our stay which is normal practice around the world but not at the sloane square hotel it didn t change what we paid obviously but is a bit insulting as a visitor and not handled or explained well by hotel staff at the time it is also expensive when compared to other similar hotels in the city
