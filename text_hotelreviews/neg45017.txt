the staff in the restaurant were not friendly or very professional it is clear that they are understaffed we waited minutes without anyone coming up to us to take our order or apologize for the wait as we were leaving the waitress said with a smile oh you re leaving ok unprofessional standards for a hotel which is otherwise quite good it would be best to either hire more staff to handle a normal sized crowd it was full but not packed or do not offer a restaurant until you can run it professionally
