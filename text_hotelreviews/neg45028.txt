breakfast is expensive and not so much very basic and if you want something more simply fried eggs for example you have to pay more in the bar there is no service at the table you have to get everything yourselves from the bar i don t mind doing this but if you pay this much for food and drinks i would expect something more if you need a taxi go one street further and get one yourself if the hotel calls one for you you will get a nicer car but for double the price
