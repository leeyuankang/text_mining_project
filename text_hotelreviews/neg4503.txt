we have stayed here a few times but some areas of the hotel are looking a bit tired we were initially initially in room but requested to be moved after the first night due to being woken at by building work going on outside this was dealt with in a very professional manner by the reception staff and we were moved into which met with our expectations also you have a resident mouse that likes to frequent the bar fairly late in the evening on a regular basis
