the way i was treated at cot restaurant i was not accommodated to have tea and a snack and told to order it from my room the manager on duty was highly rude room service it seems there isn t proper set up for this orders are placed through cot so menu is limited and the options aren t great they didn t answer their phone over and over i suggest putting in your own kitchen and having proper room service available it was very unpleasant dealing with this food was brought without silverware and ask and pepper
