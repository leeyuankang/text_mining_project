we checked in around annd went straight out so we did not noticed that our room was extremely noisy noise from an outside shaft stopped at and started again furthermore there was no daylight in the room making it extremely claustrophobic on a very hot day i complained in the morning and was told that if i had done so in the evening sorry did not feel like doing it at midnight they would have given us a better room as some were free it s never pleasant to hear you were deliberately given the worst room was also told that the manager would be in touch this has not happened
