be aware that when you book a small room in this hotel this is indeed a very small room this was not an issue for us but our room did had a window but blocked by a mirror effect in order to hide the very ugly courtyard it was also very noisy because of all the ac in this courtyard in conclusion if you hesitate go for the normal rooms which are times bigger and i guess with a proper window
