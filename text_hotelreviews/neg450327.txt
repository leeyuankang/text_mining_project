the room was very small to say we had been upgraded i dread to think how small the room i booked would have been also the instructions for the coffee maker within the room aren t the best it took me a while to work oit how to actually get coffee out of the machine not just hot water you have to get the placement of the capsules just right or it falls through into the collection tray
