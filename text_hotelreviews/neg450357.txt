the room had no view was tired looking dark and drab bedside light did not work the bathroom was awful not very clean hairs in bath and sink dried bath products on the tiles with a low ceiling leaking shower and poor ventilation although they do provide elemis products which was the only plus i d like to note that this was an upgrade i would have complained but i had already complained time about the constant drilling coming from another part of the building as the noise and vibrations were terrible however after complaining we were offered a comp breakfast from cotes i don t know about the other rooms but the twin room we had on the floor is in need of redecoration in my opinion
