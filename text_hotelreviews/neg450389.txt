i have stayed at this hotel a few times and have always been more than pleased however this time very disappointed with the tinee tiny double room for one person it is small for two positively poor and i could barely get in the shower would be good if i was a size ft individual so not impressed as i think for the room is excessive the only way to change it would have been an upgraded however the hotel was full
