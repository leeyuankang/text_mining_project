hotel did not have the rooms available that we had booked we had received emails to confirm that one room would have a king size bed and the other single beds but on arrival the hotel only had one room with single beds and one room with a miniscule double bed we were told that we had to upgrade the second room at our cost in order to get the room we had originally booked there were also only upgraded club rooms available at the back of the hotel and we had to change room times due to the noise from the aircon extraction systems at the back of the hotel so we paid extra to have a room at the back of the hotel with no view and unbearable noise considering the mixup made by the hotel the upgrade should have been complimentary unfortunately the attitude of the staff in this regard was disappointing i am left wondering whether this is the modis operandi of the hotel to sell a room on bookings com that the hotel does not actually have and then force the clients to upgrade and pay a premium to get what one originally booked
