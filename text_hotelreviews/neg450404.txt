the room i stayed was good size however i don t know how small it might have been if i didn t get an upgrade i booked for standard doubles to be fair this was my first time in uk and i didn t have a frame of reference to the size of the room i mostly travelled in asia and i understand rooms in uk and europe are quite small comparatively
