the lift was broken when we arrived so we carried out cases up several flights of steep stairs to the second floor although this was quickly resolved by tea time even with the booking com discount the room seemed overpriced for a small window with the view of a grotty courtyard and extractor fan which hummed all night there was no kettle in the room only a coffee maker the facilities in the room were limited and after one cup of tea we had to go and find more supplies of milk for tea in the morning there was no information in the room about room service although luckily we didn t need it this time there was no heated towel rail
