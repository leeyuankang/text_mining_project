we woke up after one night with red bumps that very much resembled bed bugs the staff followed up with us and let us know that an investigator examined the room and no bed bugs were found however this does not explain that we woke up with these bites all over our body where our skin was exposed for pounds a night i was not expecting to be bitten in my sleep moreover our room was not ready when we checked in at the room we were eventually given was tiny and far from luxurious besides the excellent location there was nothing positive about our stay and i would not recommend this hotel to other guests
