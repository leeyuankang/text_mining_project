i think in general the hotel was not worth the money once i booked it a few weeks later it had gone down by over pounds for the same period l asked the receptionist if i could have it at the lower rate as advertised on booking com however her english was not good and she could not understand what was trying to say it was my wife s birthday and didn t want to spoil it i would not stay there again for the price
