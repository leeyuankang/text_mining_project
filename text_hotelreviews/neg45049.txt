for such a high class hotel and if they offer the facilities they should try to ensure it works for example the door to the balcony was not working properly and if i were to force lock it i am afraid it ll break it plus they do have the retractable magnifying mirror but it could hardly stay upright in other words you have it but you can t use it they face serious lack of staff both at front desk and restaurant not all staff portray good service
