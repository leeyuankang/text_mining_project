wasn t happy with location booking com stated miles from centre when it was actually about although very near to tram bus stop direct into city centre we would of liked to have been closer nothing in the area for tourists and a non alcohol area and hotel too which we did not realise the night bus from was unreliable and difficult to use so we had to make sure we were back before or pay for a taxi again we did not like this a shame because the hotel itself was good
