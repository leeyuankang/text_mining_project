the staff was amazing almost all the time there was one girl who was very unhelpful along with the guy running the restaurant they sent me back and forth between the two of them when i was just wanting to look at a menu in the end they pretty much just brushed me off and we re actually very rude about it also the internet was terrible it constantly would drop and we would have to keep re logging in the room was very clean but the shower did not drain properly it was kind of gross honestly
