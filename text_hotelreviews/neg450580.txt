the way one staff member dealt with the payment at the reception was disgusting the lady who checked us in was rude and unhelpful there was a technical problem with the hotel receiving our payment on arrival via card payment one particular staff member said it was our problem and that we couldn t stay unless the payment had gone through even after calling my bank for confirmation that the payment had left my account after three hours of dealing with this situation and finally speaking to booking com who spoke to another staff member the man agreed to check us in and apologised for the problem the rude staff member made us feel uncomfortable and unwelcome
