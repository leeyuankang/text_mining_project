the hotel had more of a feel of being a hostel majority of staff were rude and unapproachable if i required any assistance i was made to feel as though i was an inconvenience to them i had booked a double room but was allocated a room with two single beds pushed together the hairdryer in the bathroom was covered in dust which has been there for sometime
