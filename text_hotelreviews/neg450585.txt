the cleaning of the room was appalling when we checked in the room was dusty and when we complained to the cleaning lady she said that that is the way it was and no amount of cleaning would do when she left my wife cleaned up the room and all the dust and dirt etc on second day too used coffee cups were not cleaned replaced toiletries were not replaced no spoon to mix coffee overalll very unhappy with cleaning on all days h e this must be the fault of the person handling it as we didn t encounter such problems in our two previous stays in the preceding week
