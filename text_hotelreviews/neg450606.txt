not only this hotel doesn t stand to its supposedly star classification but has dirty carpets has no basic amenities in the room no fridge no table tissue and despite advertise has no internet connection in the room to top it up it has extremely a poor customer service who only seem to hear you and not listening to a customer s concern have been lock out of the room twice already as the card didn t work and initially had to wait for half an hour for the paper work to be processed twice due to lack of attention by staff at reception tried to cancel to go to a different hotel but there was no one to process my request lastly prior to travelling to amsterdam i requested one of the booked rooms to be changed from a twin a triple which i got a confirmation for from booking com but on arrival had to go through the whole process all over again and pay the difference not sure why this had not been processed already and lastly having to sit in the lobby to use wifi connection is simply an awful experience i ever want to repeat and expected from a star hotel
