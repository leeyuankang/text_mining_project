overcharged i originally booked for days but due to late arrival of my mother s passport and visa i had to change to days i contacted the hotel enroute to amsterdam and they hiked up the price of the room to euros for two days they said a cancellation would cost euros when we arrived they confirmed that a room was euros and rooms for guests would be but they had only a single room with double beds for which they would charge euros for the first night and for the second night i have been booking through booking com for several years and previously was offered a discount i have never paid euros day for a standard three star best western twin double bed room ever i feel booking com best western should investigate and refund us the excess charged they did offer us free breakfast and car parking but only on request
