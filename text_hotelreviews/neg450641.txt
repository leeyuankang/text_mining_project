the hotel restaurant is total failure yes in the lift you can see all mouth watering pictures of dishes but in reality tomato soup tasted like it was from the can and duck was so sweet that i could barrely swallow it so we visited the restaurant once on our first evening there and never again that was the biggest dissapointment for star hotel we certainly expected more plus there is a no alcohol policy meaning that instead of having a glass of vine or beer you will have to drink water or sparkling drinks overall hotel looks worn off and needs to be refreshed
