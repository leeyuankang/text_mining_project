the facilities need a major upgrade our room keys stopped working on a daily basis on our third night we were told we cant get into our room for the night and it will have to be opened with a drill in the morning they gave us a new room but we couldn t get any of our belongings for the night the next morning the morning staff had no idea this happened and took them ages to resolve wasted almost half of our day the services is very poor the day we checked in there was construction taking place in the hallways it smelt like paint everywhere and it was difficult to walk through the hallways i m extremely dissapointed with our stay
