the price we were quoted on booking com was wrong it was more then we were told the sheets weren t changed while we were over there as the same mark was on my sheets from when i arrived to when we left the cups weren t changed either as my friend had soup in her cup and we came back there were still soup marks in the cup it was way to cold in the room even with the heating on we had to have two quilts
