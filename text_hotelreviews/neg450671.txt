our trip was in february the temperature was below zero sometimes the rooms were too cold and wouldn t heat up so the central heating seemed weak the bathrooms also had a cold breeze coming through perhaps the windows needed proper insulation as for the free wifi that was troublesome we couldn t log on and when we did it was for a few seconds i had a chat with the friendly staff and they are working on changing that though
