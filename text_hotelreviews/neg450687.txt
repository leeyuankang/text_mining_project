location not great and there are better more central hotels that i would consider paying a little more for just for the convenience it s minute tram journey to dam square from this hotel can be a bit of a pain if you like to nip back the hotel in the day or if you want to get back to bed in a hurry at the end of a long day however tram station is just outside the door step and easy connection from airport taking the number bus from stand decor was a bit dated but you get what you pay for
