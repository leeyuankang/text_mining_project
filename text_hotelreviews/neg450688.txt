location was not good minute tram ride from hotel to downtown spots this area is very middle eastern with few restaurant options the hotel has a restaurant but it was mediocre at best and there is no liquor served a bar in the front of the hotel is closed many times there was only one person at the front desk and the lines got long one day housekeeping didn t show up until pm
