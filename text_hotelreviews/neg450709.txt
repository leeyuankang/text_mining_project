first of all had a huge problem trying to cancel my booking and at the end it was just impossible even when the hotel receptionist had already told me i could do it without any charge and it was stated in the cancellation terms as well apparently there was a misunderstanding with booking com but the person that answered me at the hotel when trying to cancel the reservation was just disrespectful without any interest on helping me as a customer and did even hang up the phone just to avoid the conversation second of all when we entered our room it had a disgusting odor like a swimming pool and the glasses inside the bathroom weren t clean finally the hotel was too far from the city center would never recommend this hotel to anyone
