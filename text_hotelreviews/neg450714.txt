rooms looked very worn with stained faded carpet scratched dented furnishings which made it feel unclean even though it did not look dirty walls were thin neighbors conversations were not even muffled housekeeping and others knocked on my door despite a do not disturb sign but they also left a bag hanging outside the door with fresh towels which was a very nice unexpected touch location was not convenient to any tourist attractions or main parts of downtown however there are various public transportation options slow but cheap that are a short walk from the hotel and the staff are helpful with directions
