on arrival the room was not ready all of the bookings within our group were wrong room types etc the air con was broken the sink did not drain and was blocked asked times to be fixed and nothing was done the shower flooded no fridge in room no water in room no bar alcohol in the hotel hotel was very dirty and needs redecorating everything peeling back or falling off night staff very very rude to customers you have to pay for parking even though the hotel owned the car park and it is part of the same building a total rip off
