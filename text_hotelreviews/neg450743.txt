first room which we got was with really wet carpet i suppose something was leaking in the bathroom so the smell was just awful and plenty flies in the room the receptionist changed this room for better one because of that so this was cool but i think it s better to take an eye on such things also cleanliness should be better for star hotel we ordered breakfast to the room and put the tray to the corridor so our tray was there more than day also so garbage in corridor next to elevators was just on the floor like the whole day
