they seem to be charging different rates for each day of the week despite staying in the same room this seems to be standard practice in amsterdam hotels for tuesday and wednesday for thursday and for friday evening despite sleeping in the same room they initially put us in a twin room expecting us as a couple to sleep separately we complained and with the help of booking com and the proof of booking a double room we managed to cancel that booking and make another booking for a double room with the same hotel saving us over all in all it wasn t a good experience to be provided a twin room when the booking email said we would get a double room on top of this charging us more for that unwanted twin room was not a good practice for a hotel in amsterdam no apologies offered by the staff making us feel like we were battling for our contractual right to stay in the room we booked it took quite a while to settle the problems
