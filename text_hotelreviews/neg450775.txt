i was surprised that the wifi wasn t working at all second floor i dropped smth in the bathroom and when i bent to pick it up i couldn t help noticing that the under side of the toilet bowl was rather dirty not that i normally care about it because normally i don t inspect that part of the toilet but nevertheless in my room i had stuff for making tea cups teabags sugar but no kettle that was really disappointing let s be honest it s a star hotel but a rather shabby star hotel though on the whole the price quality ratio was still very good
