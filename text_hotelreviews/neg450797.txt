the cleanliness was good but not excellent the table where the hot water coffee pot was located in our room seemed a little dusty the tub was cleaned but there was grout on the bottom ledge of the glass that could have been removed we had to pay euros a day for parking there was no refrigerator in our room the hotel did offer to hold items in the reception area s fridge but we did not think this was practical the food seemed over priced i paid euros for a small tomato soup that tasted like it was right out of a can
