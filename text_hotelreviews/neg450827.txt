the woman took double the amount she was suppose to i asked her before i entered my pin for the time if it would charge me twice she said no due to an error on the card system but it took twice the amount staff said they couldn t give me back the money because they needed proof they were so quick to take the money and so slow to give it back i had to call my bank back in the uk they reversed the transaction and i got my money back
