scandalous hotel not a stars at all i will never stay in here ever again bathroom ceiling over the shower completely damaged tiny bathroom for a bedroom that is supposed to be for people how dare you to call yourself a stars really bed bugs i have bites everywhere after staying in your hotel my back my arms my hands my face my shoulders i need to get a treatment now because of your dirty and non treated rooms i strongly advise you to hire a specialist to get all of your rooms disinfected false fire alarm it went off at night at midnight and in the morning at am the fire alarm goes off each time after someone takes a shower after a shower you open the room to get out of the bathroom which means the steam goes outside and because some really not clever people put a fire alarm just outside of the bathroom the fire alarm goes off we then got accused of smoking by one of your hotel guy named karim who knocked at our door at midnight to check if we smoked and who did not apologize at all since this is clearly the hotel s fault at checkin you should clearly mention to people that they should let the door close after taking a shower otherwise the alarm goes off your hotel is really bad i have been staying in and stars before in many countries and yours only deserve believe me last but not least location is far from the city center so really there is no reason for me to ever stay here ever again
