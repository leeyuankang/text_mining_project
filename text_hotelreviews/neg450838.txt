the fire alarm went off at am requiring everyone to evacuate the building they should have made a pa announcement when it was safe to go back but instead it was word of mouth from one guest to another how do you know if that is reliable information apparently a guest was smoking in their room in this non smoking facility maybe the hotel rules sheet given to each guest should state that the smoke detectors are sensitive enough to react to cigarette smoke on top of noting the cleaning fee charged if guests smoke in their room
