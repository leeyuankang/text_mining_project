everything really we booked this place well in advance requested a double bed but all we got in return for our stay was two single beds pushed together a member of staff greeted us at the front desk on arrival as we went to pay the amount for the four day stay hidden charge he proceeded to tell us that there will be a city tax of charged to us on top of the payment which i questioned him about but in response we got no real solid answer the hotel had a bar to the front which was both derelict closed as another member of staff pointed out she told us if wanted a drink we could have one in the restaurant situated at the rear of the hotel where we overheard another member of staff talk bad of some other guests staying at the hotel that only wanted to have a few drinks in the bar that was closed like us there was an overpriced no change vending snack machine in the lobby that had not much seating for guests the area in which we were situated in amsterdam was both dull depressing which was very overpriced also area unknown to us before booking they didn t seem to cater for any outsiders on small things such as recognizable foods or any beers so on we even found some of the locals not so friendly there was also a long rough ride to town on their metro system ticket price for an hour in the city or for sometimes the sleeping at night was mostly disturbed due to other guests coming going about the hotel banging doors we were also unhappy with the fact that there was no smoking area set aside for guests but all there was was the outside steps of the hotel in the busy street then at night out there for a smoke you had to go through their door system of buzzing the door bell to get back in well lastly i would never recommend this hotel or area to anyone traveling to amsterdam
