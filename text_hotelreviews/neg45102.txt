i was there few days ago hotel in the ground floor bar area is facing issues with rodents it was the first time in my traveling times and i travel a lot i am a star alliance gold member i come up with such an experience i stayed for a night evening to morning in a nice room on a higher floor however during the afternoon and evening in the ground floor bar area and corridor to the back elevator i saw such small mice running just in front of me in occasions the first as i was going to get to the back lift as the main one was under repair the second as i was enjoying a complementary drink as the last customer in the bar where two little ones entered the large room to finish of some leftovers on the floor from a couple just enjoyed their beers with snacks in front of my table really really weird experience for sure not expected in a hotel i found my self going back to my room on a higher floor checking if some little thing with a tail and for sure not mickey could fit under my door i do not know if it is the near river location or it was just that day or if there was another excuse for such a situation it is just unacceptable needless to say i did not had breakfast it was served on ground floor i know my report may sounds strange or extreme but i cant keep it this is what i saw and i would appreciate to had such info well before i hope they deal with it soon cause rooms are ok and personnel too deserving much better
