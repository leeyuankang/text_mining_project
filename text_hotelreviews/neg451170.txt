i was given a sort of a corner room which might have affected its size and set up this upset me a lot since it was my understanding i pay for a regular room of the class i was renting the bathroom was cramped you can hit the sink with your head while sitting on the toilet apologies for detail when i just arrived to the room i found hair in the bathroom and on the bed the bar had nothing from the list it supposed to have except for small bottles of water it would be nice for the hotel to offer as a courtesy a free bottle of water especially in summer i don t plan to stay again there it has to be mentioned though that the price offered by the hotel was among the attractive on average in the city at the time i searched though not low it seems to be a mass hotel and that is definitely affecting its quality for instance the trash was not taken out of trash bin after the first day
