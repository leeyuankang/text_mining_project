we did not like the bathroom very small the shower could not lock properly it was small and much water leaked out on the floor there were no hooks for the clothes the price for the breakfast offer is high the breakfast selection is average coffee from the machine is poor the breakfast hall is large crowded and very noisy we did not have good morning feeling from it we would choose place to eat out for example naschmart a famous market with many stalls and restaurants offering products from different countries it is about minutes on foot from the hotel there is also billa supermarket round the corner
