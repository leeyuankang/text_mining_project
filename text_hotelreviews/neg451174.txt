it was not warm welcome at all i booked double room and they gave me twin room and the excuse was anything else is already full while i was booking there was exactly said double room not an option finally someone else from reception found a double room anyway it was annoying to argue with them after long journey also other guests had problem with parking because they didnt had free space and guests had to park on the streets and pay for it extra
