we took a standard room room was clean but a bit shabby we also noticed some black stripes on the walls probably left by bags wc was ok quite old but still functional they forgot to put some soap though minibar had only sparkling water which is strange for star hotel so our the verdict is if can have a good deal on the room go for it otherwise you may can be disappointed on quality price since the hotel is charging quite a big price up to euro for a room a would probably give the hotel stars not
