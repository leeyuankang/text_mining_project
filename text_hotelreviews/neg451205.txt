i ve added a comment to my booking made in advance saying that i would be grateful for a clean and quite room as my wife is pregnant and she would like to sleep well and the hotel gave us the room closest to the elevator and in the very begining of the corridor which means that every single guest on the whole floor was passing our room which is not quite at all this is a mockery the garage was full on the day of our arrival so i was forced to search for a parking lot nearby doing so at midnight was not conveniet at all extremly crowded hotel hundreds of tourists are arriving by bus checking in and checking out one or two buses are staying in front of the entrance all the time very basic food difficult to find anything tasty the apple we took one was rotten inside the cleaning staff does not care about overall cleaness of the hotel so much that once we saw cleaning quipment left in the elevator that was laying on the floor of cabin for hours and nobody took it on the day of our departure we knew that we had a separate from the crowd restaurants for the breakfast we had two breakfasts before and nobody mentioned it the food is the in all areas in a restarant and in canteen both electronic keys stoped working on a second day requires re innovation no slippers in star hotel we paid euros for night stay in a basic double room and i have a strong doubt that hundreds and hundreds of tourists constantly arriving by bus and departing paid the same amount i had a feeling that the hotel earns it s margin on tourist like us who travel not within a company and those who travel by a large company enjoy the rates at least times less this hotel never again and would not recommend to anyone price did not match the quality at all and on response for request of a quite room the hotel gave us the worst possible option
