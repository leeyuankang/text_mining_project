as i traveled with my mother of i feel obliged to include her opinion as well she was disappointed in the toilet paper i kid you not and that no toiletries were provided breakfast was good but could have been better in some aspects for example the br tchen rolls buns were horrible all in all she expected a little more from a four star hotel i guess what we both noticed was that the cleaning staff was out very early every morning they were very talkative which really is not great with the doors being so badly soundproofed the same goes for some of the other hotel guests but you cannot blame the hotel for this
