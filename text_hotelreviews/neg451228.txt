first time im leaving such a bad review for a hotel website left a false impression of the hotel we booked executive double room looks like the room was a double room before and they basically shoved two beds together the light switches were right in the middle of our bed rest which was very uncomfortable we were a couple that s why we booked a king size bed but they ve given us seperate single duvets room was not fully prepared on arrival even though we arrived hours after check in time tv would not svivel sideways so you can t watch it properly while you re in bed as it was facing the opposite wall soft drinks were complimentary but only one bottle of coke and a juice even though there were two of us and these were not replaced the next day we would only get the fizzy water and sometimes coke and juice bottle there was only one door in the closet no coffee or tea making facilities in the room mirror opposite the bed was weird the room was really plain for an executive room and not very cosy there were no paintings or any cosy details apart from one bamboo stick on the table shower was way too small and the fan on the bathroom did not do it s job at all wires sticking out from the hairdryer socket not acceptable view outside the window was tolerable walls had very strange pattern and were torn bulging out dirty and oily in many places stains on the chairs no mini bar in the room at all no room service either slamming doors in the morning quite loud big gap below the main door breakfast was included in our room price was pretty boring bland or over seasoned in most cases everything was very salty breakfast fruit was basically chopped fresh fruit with conserved fruit mixed together and was overly sweet and disgusting no other fruit available not even an apple no bacon either the scrambled eggs were undercooked and watery
