only downfall was that we ordered room service late at night and had to pay with cash upfront and the lady had no change to give us maybe this practice is more universal in uk but usually when i stay in hotels the room service is always paid for when checking out also if this was part of their policy it should have been made clear to us on arrival or when placing our order for room service
