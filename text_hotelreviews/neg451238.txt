we just wanted to spend three days in vienna relaxing the hotel was noisy okay that s not their fault but even the room was noisy due to the heating we had to stop the heating for the night then the room became cold and it became colder when the cleaning lady left the windows open in freezing cold but she forgot to empty the trash and there wasn t a gesture saying oh we re sorry beds are soft very soft not good and on the last morning i had this altercation with one of the hotel staff i closed the door to the business centre so i could work and it was very cold in the lobby but he told me in that the door needs to stay open there was no one else in the centre and there was no point ot this we did not feel like we re in a four star hotel
