i won t recommend this place because if you will need something they will be too busy with other people to help you according to their words i couldn t open the door problem with the battery of the card reader the team in the reception told me about it since the first day but didn t try to fix it during my night stay i went to the lobby everyday few times a day to ask for new keycards and was demanding a technican which never came i don t think that i should have shout at the staff but maybe i should have do that because they was indifferent and unfriendly i think that it s outrageous that i came few times a day to change keycards instead of just changing the lock besides that for a star hotel i was expecting differences in the breakfast each day but it was always the same everyday without many options
