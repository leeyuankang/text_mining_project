the room was not well cleaned every day there was quite a bit dirt and hair and dust on the floor there was also no carpet in the room so it was a little cold to walk bearfoot there were no tea or coffee making facilities in the room either had to get a kettle and give a deposit at reception then had to get mugs from the bar these were not cleaned every day and left dirty so we had to clean them ourselves
