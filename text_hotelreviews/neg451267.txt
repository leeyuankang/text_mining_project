we booked a double bed room but we got a twin bed room pushed together we had a problem with the bathtub because it was clogged we asked them to fix it and their fix was to remove the drain cover we asked to change the room they offered first a room with twin bed this time separate which was not acceptable so they offered us an upgraded room which we found out was not an actual upgrade as it didn t have a bathtub and it had a shower with the same problem seems like the hotel has a problem with plumbing and it was noisy too so we had to decline that offer as well and ask them to fix the problem with our room which they promised they would do but they didn t until we left one more thing the breakfast was very limited in choices
