not enough parking space in garage you can not reserve the garage and they don t warn specially on booking when you ask them be aware that vienna has a strange signs for no parking costs of the service that take your car somewhere eur away by taxi is eur and there s one place exactly in front of hotel so caution if you don t want to lose money for sightseeing eggs for breakfast for me weren t ok without any taste a little bit poor breakfast very thin walls you can hear everything from room near you in my opinion there s better hotels in vienna for this price
