this was the worst star rated hotel i ve ever been to smelly room poor soundproof isolation so you could hear the elevators all the time and also the nearby metro trains very small bathroom with even smaller shower from toiletries you get only universal liquid soap the mini bar had only small bottles of water not very polite stuff didn t expect that not in vienna at least
