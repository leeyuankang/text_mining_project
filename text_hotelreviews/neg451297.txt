in description the hotel has parking but we had the surprise that there were not enough parking places related to the no of rooms so we spent hours from our short trip arguing with the reception it was the only reason that we choose this hotel it is huge crowded not recomended if you don t want to stay in line for a long time for check in or solv other issues in this hotel
