location was poor the area wasn t very nice lacked good restaurants and the nachs market was not a nice place to visit the breakfast at the hotel was terrible it was like a cattle market we ate only once there the rooms were tiny but clean not worth the money it was a very busy hotel coaches were dropping people off all day long they stayed one night then went the next day very noisy on the corridors
