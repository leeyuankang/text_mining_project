very disappointed with our stay in this hotel room was basic and didn t deserve its star rating when comparing to previous hotels we had stayed in on our trip after experiencing a dreadful nights sleep due to an extremely loud drilling noise apparently coming from the air conditioning which we did contact reception about and were advised to turn it off which made no difference as the noise continued to consistently interrupt our sleep at various points throughout the night we complained when we was checking out although the member of reception staffs manners were excellent our complaint was not taken seriously at all and was basically dismissed no details were written down or recorded and when we showed the reception staff a video we had recorded of the noise he proceeded to speak to his manager who unfortunately did not have the time or even manners to come and speak to us personally we were then offered a breakfast as compensation even though we had just walked though the breakfast room and it was being cleared away as breakfast was finished so we declined as we felt we were entitled to some form of financial compensation or discount this was not entertained or even considered by the hotel and we were given a voucher for two small drinks which was basically a joke and thrown in the bin the recording of the abrasive noise is available on request and will be attached to my reviews overall a very disappointing and underwhelming experience in this hotel and we will not be recommending anyone to stay in a trend hotel
