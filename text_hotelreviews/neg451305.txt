i didnt like the check out day there was one staff a man who take care of our luggages another one my partner wanted to set up the bags on the bike so that he brought the bike in just in front of the luggage room but the guy started to shouting that this is a hotel and you guys cant bring the bike in and keep being rude which i didnt expected the first day we boths brought the bike in the hotel front of checkin counter with actually no problem i mean actually if its prohibit or something you guys should at least speak with respect not like we are asking you for money or food we pay for that so
