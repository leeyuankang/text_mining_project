nothing negative to comment on only minus point but a very small one was that the main lift was out of service but the service lift was easy to access and the chamberlain more than compensated for this by offering free drinks the fact that they go out of their way to make up for what was in this case an absolutely inconsequential inconvenience indicates a positive and realistic approach to customer satisfaction which is very much appreciated by this customer
