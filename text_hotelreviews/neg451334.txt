wi fi was not working well the single room i was staying is like a cell you feel like in prison there no balcony i had breakfast once immediately after i returned to the room form the restorant i got a bad case of diarrhea the restorant cleanliness was questionable mostly chineese personell but i have to admit that when i complained at the reception and said i don t want to pay for that breakfast they resisted for a while then canceled it so i didn t have to pay for that obviously this is not star hotel may be or star as a maximum it is low budget hotel that happens to be located conveniently no good value you can get better hotel for this money bigger room closer to the city centre and normal breakfast
