i am always booking via this website ans the reviews are normaly accurate and even if the hotel was ok i don t think it was rating the facilities were a bit old and it was smelling cigarette in the corridors yould hear everyone from oustide in your room the glass door in the bathroom was so thin that you could here everything if someone was in however the value was good and the location is nice
