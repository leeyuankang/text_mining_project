i believe the hotel provides breakfast to many tour companies and this makes the lobby and breakfast area extremely crowded the lobby also smelt slightly of cigarette smoke the hotel just seemed a little beat up for example the scuff marks on the floors and walls in the room also there is no wifi in the rooms and while i knew this when booking the hotel it seems very odd that this isn t available especially for such a large hotel lastly the bed was very firm
