staff were very rude and not taking care of anyone from the parking vallet to the reception staff and the breakfast staff the room was dirty and there was no soap we asked to be fixed we went for a walk came back after hours and there was no change hotel manager didn t want to speak to us a guy from reception tried to help on the second request but apparently the cleaning staff was already home we were told it was pm and this is not possible to happen in a network hotel will definitely not come back to this place
