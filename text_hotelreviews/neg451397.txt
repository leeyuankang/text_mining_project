it s not a bad experience as such but the hotel clearly mainly caters for mass tourism we mistakenly used the tourist breakfast room on our first day and it was pretty basic no tables laid we had to ask for decaf coffee croissants were a strange consistancy a large buffet to negotiate however the next day we found the executive breakfast room which was much better we prefer smaller hotels
