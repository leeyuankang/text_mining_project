just one disappointment the sandwich we ordered from room service my husband asked for a toasted sandwich but it wasn t toasted when it arrived we queried this and were told the toaster wasn t available which would have been ok if we d be told this at the time we placed our order i guess we could have sent it back and asked for a refund but we were hungry so ate the sandwich although left the wilted mouldy lettuce we found in the dressing on the side
