there were no coffee and tea facilities in my room i think because they charge extra for a nespresso machine if i was staying longer than one night i would have appreciated this the previous night s hotel hotel ploberger in wels had the cool decor gym and sauna that this hotel has but also had a bottle of spring water and an apple in my room on check in and coffee and tea making facilities for the price the location is excellent but is three stops on the metro to the city centre
