staff is kind however there is a lack of training for them and or the electronic system used is very limited and poor as always i chose to get a rate without breakfast reception informed if i would change my mind i still could have the breakfast it was just necessary to show up and inform at reception desk from breakfast room and they would make the arrangements as i decided to get breakfast at the hotel i follow the instructions and showed up next morning first surprise even before enter the room i was requested to pay eur at this point i asked them to include the amount into the hotel bill what was not possible so i asked the person to pay with credit card and was not possible either as i did not have cash with me i was allowed to take the breakfast with the promise to return later with the cash and pay it was an embarrassing and inconvenient situation that could be easily avoided if amount could be included in the total bill from the hotel like in any other hotel i stayed or if at least breakfast could be paid by credit card brought me the impression the staff made me a big favor to be allowed to get breakfast and pay later as a hotel and a service provider they should target to delight customers not embarrassing them
