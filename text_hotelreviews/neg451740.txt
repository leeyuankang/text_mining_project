stars hotel and premium room with cm king size bed is far to little sleeping comfort accordingly upon arrival no soap which seemed to be a problem to solve for the reception staff safe was unable to be used and we had to wait for its reset until next morning the room had probably not been used for some days thus the air condition had been turned down and the temperature was above degrees c breakfast quite nice but partly with clearly cheap commodities and bread one morning no bacon and just a short not available today from unfriendly kitchen staff all in all the price of the hotel room and the hotel s status as star hotel are not justifiable
