definitely the security we stayed here for one night and my boyfriend s backpack was robbed from our room while we were sleeping very early in the morning we noticed that the door was opened and we called reception when the guy from the front desk came upstairs he found the backpack in our corridor left on the floor without some valuable belongings his laptop apple macbook pro and his retrocamera fujifilm when the police came they checked the door and the lock was not violated therefore it looks like we did not lock the door properly when we arrived and it was easy for the thief to come and take the backpack that we left close to the door but how surprised we were that there were not any security camera on the floor to follow this robbery incident the hotel has them on the ground floor and according to the guy at the from desk he did not see anyone leaving the building between midnight and am of the day of the robbery anyway we realized there is no way to follow this case since in this hotel btw is a large hotel chain they do not have security cameras in that floor we feel really disappointed and since it seems that guests are not covered by hotel s liability in this type of incidents i consider highly important to share our experience to prevent future robbery incidents i am sure the thief knew about these security holes and that the risk of being caught is almost nule i recommend that if you choose to stay at this place double check that you close properly the door since is the only security they offer
