i checked out from this hotel last feb and i couldn t believe they charged me not once not twice but thrice the lady at the reception who checked us in seemed apologetic because she knew i was charged twice and i accepted since it can happen upon checking out the new lady doesn t even care if my bank texted me about the charges fyi i receive text everytime i purchase something and she literally said i do not care about your bank since i am catching a flight back home i ended up paying again i emailed the hotel since i left and no response until now
