the staff have serious case of bad attitude my friend and i stayed nights at this hotel and on the second day when we came back to our room her money was stolen from her wallet that was stashed deep inside her backpack we found out from the room access log that the only people who went into our room were the manager on night shift and the housemaid yet we got no apology whatsoever from the manager whose card was used to access our room he kept saying that his card was probably stolen or copied by someone else and the other hotel staff on duty defended the housemaid saying that the person had been working with the hotel for more than years they used very accusory tone when they said that we shouldn t have left our stuff in the room they should at lease apologize for what happened right in their hotel which was clearly committed by their own people so the worst part about this hotel is its staff who are inconsiderate dishonest and not helpful by any standards
