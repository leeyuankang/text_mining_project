very rude receptionist he told me i didn t have a booking we were extremely tired and he took half an hour fiddling with things before he let us check in at the whole place was pretty dreary breakfast shut at which is quite unfair on guests arriving from late trains seeing as it s right next to a train station the room was cleanish but the floor was dirty bed was quite hard and uncomfy also the aircon didn t work so we all woke up in hot sweats
