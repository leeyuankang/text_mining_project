i didn t like you taking an additional per night just for fun we said we weren t anticipating using mini bar etc i said i wasn t happy about this but was told it wasn t optional i understood that it would be refunded but that is not the point if i want something i will pay for it i don t feel it s appropriate for them to take my money just in case this will play a bit part in my decision to use you again
