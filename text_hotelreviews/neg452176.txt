because the dlr runs by the hotel i as a light sleeper found it too noisy and i was on the upper floors i couldn t sleep after the trains started running again in the middle of the night breakfast staff a bit too eager to clear everything away before you had even finished which was annoying i was ultra tired after no sleep the breakfast itself rather plain for the type brand of hotel nothing special the hotel is a walk mins from canary wharf and not in a road that has anything much on it in terms of shops or restaurants so you need to be in cw for that also the restaurant in the hotel closed at early for a friday night and their room service menu is limited in my opinion
