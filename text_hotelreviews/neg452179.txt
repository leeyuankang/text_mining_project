unfortunately the bed in the room was super uncomfortable it was almost like sleeping on a concrete floor i stayed in the hilton london wembley back in the mattresses there were like a dream they were mattresses you could just sink into when you lay down on them it seems since then all hilton hotels have changed their mattress supplier i would love to continue staying in hilton hotels but unless the mattresses change this will not be possible i suffer with bad back problems as it is this only exacerbates the problem i would however like to express highest regards to chet at the hilton london canary wharf upon learning of my issue with the mattress in my room he immediately set about rectifying the problem upgrading my room to an executive room giving me exclusive access to the executive lounge which was very much appreciated chet went above beyond in all honesty deserves a promotion hold on to this guy he s a keeper
