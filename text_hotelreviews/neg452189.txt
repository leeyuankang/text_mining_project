we changed room as the suite we were given was way below the standard that is expected for the price that we had paid we were very disappointed we complained straight away and were moved the second suite was a bit better and complimentary bubbles and strawberries were given to us i was shocked at the shabby state of the rooms compared to other high end hotels vastly over priced very disappointing
