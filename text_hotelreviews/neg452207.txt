the bed is uncomfortable it s old and very hard it should be replaced the ventilation is very noisy we had to turn it off during the night cleaning could be better a comment about the breakfast service the staff works hard but i see a lack of organization the hotel was full during our stay and clearly the breakfast room wasn t large enough we had to wait in line to have a table there is only one island with water and juices and a full tank was emptied in less than minutes there was a continuos shortage of stock of dishes and glasses the servers were running at full speed all the time and in all directions i feel like they were seriously understaffed everyone had to do everything exemple the person at the reception had to leave a couple of times to serve coffee while people was waiting in line i understand the unusual peak of customers during easter days but it looked like the management left the usual staff cover all the overcharge this is poor management imho they had to enforce the team and the facilities during these days i ve felt bad for the staff they were working way over their capacity the situation was chaotic
