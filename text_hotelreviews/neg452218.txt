not impressed with reception staff and management i booked a twin room and a double for nights my colleague and her father arrived first and were told that they could not check in because i had made the booking my friend had a copy of the reservation emailed from me and her father was the named guest on the booking for the double room both offered to provide their credit cards to guarantee the rooms but they said it was against their security policy my friend contacted me whilst i was on the train to see if i could do anything as her father a pensioner was very distressed the hotel eventually let them in the rooms when i arrived i asked if i could straighten things up and provide my credit card which i booked it on they said this wasn t necessary now since it was all sorted so whilst i was annoyed that this had happened i decided to let it go however on the morning whilst my friend and i were out her father was having a rest in his room and he was contacted to say he needed to check out because he was not booked in for a third night again her father rang us up distressed a nice reception lady did sort this out for him so we didn t need to come back but it should never have happened when i returned that evening i spoke to the manager about the unnecessary distress caused to us all on two occasions he said that it was the hotels security policy to allow only the person that books to check in and the issue with the unwanted checkout was a booking com fault which i doubt since i have not had this issue before he did not take on any blame and did not offer any apology to me i didn t want to distress myself any further so i left it my friends dad pursued further and he offered us a free breakfast next morning i think they took this up but i didn t since i could not stomach any more of the hotel after a bad nights sleep following this altercation
