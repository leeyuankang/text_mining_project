the restaurant food was limited in options and very overpriced the breakfast however was good and the staff had extended the breakfast time to am which was very handy the pillows could have been more comfortable beware of booking taxi from the hotel cause a luxury taxi will arrive and charge you similar rates so specify that you need a simple taxi unless you prefer only luxury beware and avoid drinks from the mini bar very over priced
