the attitude of the staff when we checked in was cold and rash nothing we have experienced before when staying the room stunk when we got in and on advising the staff i was reminded that they will change my room to the same category like i was looking for a free upgrade this made me very angry further more there was no bed for my son i m reconsidering my choice of hotel now
