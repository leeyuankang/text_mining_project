was asked if we wanted to up grade to executive lounge whichwas an extra i did so only to find there was a time limit on the bar and breakfast up there was only continental if we wanted full english we had to eat down stairs we were there to see a show so never got to use the executive lounge as due to limited bar times it was closed so ended up paying for nothing
