my daughter and her friend were not allowed in the room despite me speaking to reception to confirm my payment details as i was going to be delayed in arriving at the hotel they had to go out without changing after a long journey from somerset when i arrived the extra bed was not in the room so had to wait for the bed to arrive and then housekeeping to make it up reception staff have definitely read from a script without personality or any empathy we were given complimentary breakfast to compensate not being able to get into the room until late but were going to be charged per person for room service which is totally unacceptable when i also had to wait until for the extra bed to be ready beds were not comfortable at all would not return to that hotel our experience was not a good one at all
