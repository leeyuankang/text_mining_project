the cooks couldn t have cared less and kept disappearing so they didn t have to cook the omelettes we felt wait staff were better but tea warm most of the time we had a hot pot of tea once only room cleaners didn t replace teas and milk obviously if they were gone we were using them so expected replacement the tray with the cups was not put away but left on the bench toiletries replaced regularly though worse was leaving the glasses dirty on more than one occassion and just putting cover back on the top i actually washed the glasses one day so i knew they were clean that day the room temperature was uncomfortable most of the time no matter what we did
