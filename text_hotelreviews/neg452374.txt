we stayed at the hotel for two nights we spent majority of the saturday morning and afternoon in the room we left our room for about hours in the evening and expected upon return our room to be cleaned with fresh towels in recent experiences with other hotels it is managed that the room when unoccupied will be cleaned whatever time during the day unfortunately this one wasn t which actually put us off using the shower on the sunday morning yes we could probably of called a number to get this sorted but for a hotel as pricey and with such a name as the hilton this should be taken care of no complimentary wifi either
