we had some minor issues the shower hose was leaking the maid woke us up very early despite having a sign on the door and the room needed to be rearranged as it was set up as twin when we arrived however the guest services manager dealt with all of these issues and offered us a discount as a gesture of goodwill as a result we felt looked after and would happily stay again
