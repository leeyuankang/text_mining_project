the lack of a decent early breakfast when i was advised by a manager the day before the ride london event i was riding that a good breakfast could be brought to my room and i could if wanted even order a hot meal this was not i understand an option and i had to remind reception that at the agreed time of i had not received my breakfast which arrived at and was a poor takeaway i had said before that i had to leave by for the start of the event bearing in mind that a large number of other riders were staying at the hotel i paid for a full breakfast for that day and i received no discount on one morning i went to get my hot breakfast and my table was cleared away and it took a few minutes to get my table re laid and a new pot of coffee brought i think the default milk on the table at breakfast for health reasons should be semi skimmed not full fat i had to ask for the lower fat option
