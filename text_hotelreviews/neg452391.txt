the hotel took from my credit card double the amount that was needed for my room and they explained that once was for the reservation once the actual payment a crazy explanation the amount was withheld for at least two weeks before being returned quite an inconvenience to be honest especially since this makes no sense whatsoever to be charged double what you owe
