we had two rooms one room had been fully equipped with washing toiletries like shampoo conditioner etc towels were arranged as swans on the bed in one room whilst the other had none of this whilst i appreciate we were able to access the room in question early to drop of luggage i still think it should have been ready by the time we got back saturday evening it was very late my children wanted to go to sleep luckily they had toiletries in their wash kits for the next day if i had known prior to checkout i would have mentioned this at the time i am not one to complain but i was slightly disappointed
