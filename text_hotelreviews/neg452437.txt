check in staff were awful insisted i sign something that i didn t want to as in relation to my data being used and when i said i wouldn t sign she told me she couldn t check me in she clearly had never read the form and only when i asked to speak to the manager did she let me check in but she did so with a very bad attitude the room size was good but it had a small bed for the size so would have liked a bigger bed also the layout of the bathroom was very cramped they need a different shower screen as you had to open it out to get in and out
