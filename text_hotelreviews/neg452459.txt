breakfast was the worst we have ever had chef who had been cooking omelettes had disappeared completely by there were no fried eggs left and no one around to cook any coffee was bitter and extremely strong one toaster burnt toast another wouldn t cook it at all no muesli specials available nobody interested in restocking food items staff checking us in told us we had to have breakfast in our room and pay cash for it our room rate included breakfast she didn t even have the decency to tell us that everything was ok after she checked with reception very poor standard of service
