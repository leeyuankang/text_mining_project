took minutes to check in because of a simple mistake due to the way the man on reception was trying to authorise my card made out that it was my fault my card was declining and cost me minutes on the phone to my bank when nothing was wrong and it just had to be put in a chip and pin reader instead of typed into the system not much sympathy from the guy just lots of assurance that it wasn t him doing it wrong not a very nice way to make a customer feel i decided after minutes of the man trying to go to a different person on check in and there joyce and mollie were helpful and very friendly and instead it took seconds the girl mollie seemed to know exactly what she was doing very nice girl and good at her job lots of hassle when it wasn t needed they should make sure everyone on the check in desks knows what they re doing also there were of us staying in a family room but we only had dressing gowns slippers and were told the next day at breakfast that there is only guests under our room number seems to have been a system error that caused a lot of confusion over our stay
