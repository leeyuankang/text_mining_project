hotel and rooms were dark with subdued lighting that made it feel gloomy in all areas except reception and the restaurant due to a large function in the quayside suite the small car park under the hotel was full and we were advised to use the nearest ncp which was half a mile away this was the only alternative and once i got there i was nervous leaving my car in the car park as it was away from the main south quay area of marsh wall in a less safe area the barriers were also closed but the car park not manned or locked from to so my car would have been unavailable if a home emergency had arisen in the night it was also the worst hotel breakfast we ve had for a while except for the fruit yoghurt watered down fruit concentrate weak tea cooked breakfast was manky and barely warm tasteless and unappealing finally the view from our room window was a building site and internal courtyard hardly stunning
