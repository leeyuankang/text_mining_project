room was a bit warm had to keep turning down temp toilet paper holder was irritating pillow very soft but that was actually preferred over too hard would love to see outlets near the bed or at least the usb outlets next to the bed instead of across the room at the desk also would be helpful if we didn t have to sign into the wifi every few hours
