was handed our room key after check in then told we could take the lift to our room but not told which floor we would need to take i know it s small matter but felt unsure if this was done due to customers privacy or not also weren t told where breakfast would be taken or what time breakfast was to be held at we had a small issue with the alarm clock being more than late but had no way of resetting the time which wasn t a big issue as i just used my phone for an alarm the main desk has a plug socket which i thought was great i could charge my computer as i did bit of work while we were at the hotel but i was worried because as i put my plug into the socket the board felt like it jolted back and had been loosened over time from wear and tear probably due to people trying to charge devices and pulling their plugs out quickly not major issues but just somethings could probably be worked on
