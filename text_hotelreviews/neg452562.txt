the room needed to be a little cleaner the comfy chair was dirty there were no bathrobes and on calling down to house keeping as advised they had none either some of the executive lounge food was poor the afternoon scones were stale and very cheaply made as were the mini cakes at breakfast which are mass produced and made of very cheap ingredients again the room was way too hot the thermostat would not go lower than and you could not open any windows which is such a waste of money the welcome at the reception desk could have been much more friendly
