i didn t have a bad experience the car park was full so had to park elsewhere i stayed in a hilton hotel in glasgow back in comparable to my recent stay at the hilton it s just not an extra special place hotel to stay anymore the standard of the hilton now is the same as many hotels it does not distinguish itself above the competition anymore it s always the little things choice of furniture pictures etc etc the s of effort here and there people have an eye for interior design because of the focus on interior design in the home and we can tell when things are little bit below a high standard or quality however people will accept less the hilton is good not excellent it used to be
