shower facilities weren t giving off hot water so i had to complain i was offered another room to shower in on the same floor apparently some tube had broken and it would ve taken over an hour for the maintenance staff to fix it i was checking out that morning hence the offer of the use of another empty room s shower facilities a little inconvenient and some sort of offer of a concession by the hotel would ve been nice ultimately the staff attended to my situation promptly and courteously
