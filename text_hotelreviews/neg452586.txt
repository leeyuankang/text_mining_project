cost of in room wifi i have stayed at less up market hotel chains which offer cheap wifi passes or in other cases free wifi throughout the hotel i mean it is we are living in pounds for hours is pretty ridiculous also tray charge for room service is disappointing room menu doesn t state that this is a service charge bar and restaurant automatically add service charge so you have to pay tray charge and also feel obligated to tip the person delivering the food
