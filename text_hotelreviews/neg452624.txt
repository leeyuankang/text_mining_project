difficult to spot the hilton sign from the road and ended up in the wrong hotel car park just before the hilton the car parking for one night at i felt was rather extortionate the bathroom was a little bit grubby and the extractor didn t work the layout was poor with the toilet behind the door and the flusher behind the toilet seat also there wasn t enough toilet roll the view from our window was of scaffolding and not very nice would have asked for another room but couldn t be bothered moving everything the breakfast for per persons was far too much considering the quality of the food which was very dry and didn t taste of much rather disappointing
