ended up arguing with front reception because we had already thrown away our booking slip after we had stayed there they were adamant that i hadn t added the breakfast and wanted to charge an extra on top they had no record of our booking we got the address wrong too but we know where we live right this was the day after our wedding and it genuinely wasn t the way i would treat someone if i was on reception she finally relented after she could probably see a queue forming as she made me go through all my emails on my iphone to try and find the booking confirmation and decided to change it not very impressive
