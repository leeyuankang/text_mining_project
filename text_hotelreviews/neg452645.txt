following two nights of blissful sleep i awakened on the third morning at am to the noise of scratching and fiddling at my bedroom door this went on a while which bewildered me but i was ok and tried to go back to sleep then i really woke up when i heard my locked door closing and it terrified me it transpired that it was my express checkout form being delivered and i can only assume whoever was delivering it simply couldn t get it underneath my door all the scratching about and had quickly opened ians closed the door to get it through easier as a lone female sleeping on top of the bed i didn t realis this and was really scared it took me a while to calm down and get back to sleep i would have rung reception to complain but needed to sleep as i was driving home that morning and so needed to relax on leaving i informed reception of my horror and dismay that this had happened and was told they would take me off express checkout at all their hotels so it couldn t happen again that felt like a punishment as opposed to a real apology and has actually made me reconsider staying at a hilton in the future as i felt as though the implication was that no one else would have been worried about their door suddenly opening totally missing the point that not only had my sleep been disturbed i then had to really work at calming down and not letting my fears run away with me it must have taken me a good ten minutes to work out why it might have happened as my initial reaction had been real fear followed by checking whether my belongings had been disturbed etc as i was half asleep and couldn t quite comprehend why my door had opened and or whether anyone had actually been in my room in the cold light of day i could tell that no one had entered but at that time i had no idea i didn t get back to sleep for well over an hour later and had to read to take my mind off how vulnerable i now felt
