sadly male guests offensive in behaviour and communication approaching female groups and trying to enter conversations with crude and over familiar chat my mother daughter and i had wanted to have a quiet post theatre drink before bed in lounge area this incident spoilt what had been a lovely day and evening we were thankful to a gentleman named ashley to his friends ash says he is regular guest due to his work he had noticed how these men were behaving and thanks to his sitting and chatting with us the other men became bored by our ignoring them and moved away to another group of females not a hotel specific issue but did mar an otherwise great stay not sure if anything could have been done but might be worth noting for lone females to be aware only other point was roof top bar had closed by time we returned from theatre and this was slight disappointment as had been told would be open until midnight had closed earlier as insufficient guests to keep it open hence our drinks in lounge bar
