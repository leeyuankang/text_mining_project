our hotel room wasn t up to a five star hotel we have stayed here three times with family and i have been in the past with girlfriends and the furniture is the same as it was in i thought it had been refurbished but the only thing i noticed differently was the drapes and blinds bedcover and wallpaper the bedside cabinets had the varnish worn away in large patches the bedside cabinet doors were all broken pushed back in on themselves and we didn t like to pull them incase the broke off the leather effect chair at the dressing table desk was bare on one side and the seat was sagging the blinds at the window were poorly made our air conditioning broke but the did fix it our room had people in it but it was only set up for two bath towels glasses mugs and two of each toiletries and biscuits i did inform the staff and they rectified this the extractor fan in the bathroom didn t work even though when i reported it they said it did but when my granddaughters went in the shower the condensation was so bad we had to leave the bedroom door open which was really bad when the air conditioning broke too that issue wasn t resolved as they held a tissue up to the extractor and they said there was suction our hairdryer broke after only using it once and the children loved the pool but they put that much chlorine in the water the children s eyes were irritated and red for hours later the iron was old my husband tried to use the steam function and it marked my grandsons top as all this brown stuff came out and our ironing board wouldn t go higher than thigh level i don t know whether the hotel give certain rooms to booking com but when i have booked directly with the hotel in the past the rooms have been of a lot better quality and reading reviews of this hotel i can t understand how some can mark it when our facilities definitely weren t
