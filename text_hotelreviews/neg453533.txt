for a five star hotel there are certain things that you expect that could have made the experience more enjoyable new televisions in the room the ones that are currently there are tired same with the music player they are suited to the old ipods not newer models furthermore in one of our storage spaces we had a cd player that was a bit random and looked out of place we had tea during our visit and whilst the cups saucers teapots etc were all decent sizes and good quality the accompanying biscuits were quite clearly out of a supermarket variety pack whilst this isn t a bad thing it is a bit out of place within a five star hotel i have stayed at four star hotels that have uniform biscuits that make the place look so much more classy these are just little persnickety things overall my stay was enjoyable the hotel is in a great location and is very clean what more can you ask for really
