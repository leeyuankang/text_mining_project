i emailed and called for an early check in i was assured it would not be a problem over the phone when i arrived in had to deal with rude front staff blank stares and we don t have a room until if you couldn t accommodate me why didn t you just say it instead of leaving me in the lurch there was nothing about this hotel to like after that
