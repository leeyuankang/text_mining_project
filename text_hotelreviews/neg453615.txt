rooms are really outdated we had triple room but it was very small and bathroom was tiny you can hear the traffic sirens at night even on the floor did not sleep during the two night stay either due to traffic noise or noisy guest and slamming of the corridor door just outside our room food service and quality is poor overall really disappointed and feel that this hotel does not deserve the start title premium prices for less then premium inn quality we have stayed in other grange hotel in london and it was absolutely fabulous from all aspects will not be recommending grange holborn to anyone
