they don t clean the sheets in the rooms you have to ask and this has nothing to do with being green it s just sloppy reception have no idea what they are doing other than just asking continually for pre authorisations on credit cards telephone is so bad you can t hear anyone including room service good luck with that i extended my stay out of work necessity this is not a five star though it pretends to be i would certainly not recommend the hotel oh they also provide no water even in the room other than in the mini bar which is again linked to pre authorisations which mean they suddenly lock the bar when you use this up with no reference to you and you can not get any water at night really poor product
