not a bad hotel but never in a million years the guy claiming to be the manager on duty at on the feb i had my doubts was hopeless i needed to move my booking and was happy to pay the difference but he just kept repeating a script rather than listening he forced me to call booking com the next day who guess what then had to call the hotel to ask them to do what i had asked which they did complete waste of time the bed and pillows weren t v comfortable either and the room a bit pokey
