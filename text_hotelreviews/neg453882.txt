they made huge mistakes when paying on checkout they charged us twice for the room we should have been able to pay cash on checkout they took a deposit on arrival which we weren t aware of yet still debited a credit card and debit card for the same they have also been very unhelpful in resolving the matter we have booked another stay in october because we like the hotel let s hope we get a discount because of all of this inconvenience
