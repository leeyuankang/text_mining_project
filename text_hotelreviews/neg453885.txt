the toilet flusher always got stuck when pressed and it was troublesome to always spend a couple extra minutes in the bathroom trying to get it unstuck the furniture was a bit weathered e g cigarette burns on the sofa at check in we were ask whether we d liked to pay upfront or upon checkout opting to pay at checkout we were asked for the card and they reserved the whole amount on it no pin number required on a pin and chip card this rendered the whole sum unavailable on the card at checkout all they had to do was press a button on their side and the sum was withdrawn from the account essentially we paid at check in with no pin number confirmation even though we had opted to pay at checkout this felt fishy fortunately we had no issue because of it but it did not feel very secure straightforward nor trustworthy
