in the first night we were woken up at a m by a terrible noise sounds like a drill from the bathroom ceiling the noise repeated a few times we were told by the front desk that they can solve it only in the morning the next day we requested to move a room and to be compensated on the horrible night we experienced they did move us to a different room but we didn t receive a proper apology and weren t compensated for that night whatsoever in addition the directions with public transport to the hotel are not clear the name of the bus station is not written and we got lost on the way in as a result of it
