they double booked my room and then one of the girls at reception told me that i had been upgraded which was completely untrue as we had booked the luxury quadruple room and what we received upon arrival was a junior suite with a double bed and a single fold out bed i was very annoyed at being lied to upon my arrival i complained at the front desk and they were not apologetic at all and could only get me into my originally booked room the next afternoon not only that they rushed us out of the wrong room the next morning for another guest it wasn t a very good first impression of the hotel at all i felt completely unimportant to them as i had arrived with two friends a couple and i was expected to sleep in their room on a fold out bed i didn t pay all that money for that not sure if i would stay again as there was no sense of urgency about it all it didn t seem like a big deal to them there was also two mice in the restaurant during lunch and dinner on my second night my roommate couldn t bring herself to eat down there again not great
