i was originally given a much smaller room than i had paid for and even after being upgraded the room still lacked many of the features specified at the time of booking obtaining the correct room took hours and at no point were the staff at all apologetic about this my bed was very uncomfortable the two mattresses were inadequately joined together and so dipped in the centre i suffer from back pain after a spinal operation so this cause me a lot of pain the hotel was also stated to have a pool when i arrived the pool was half empty covered in green scum and surrounded by birds and rabbits as if it hadn t seen use in some time
