breakfast was absolutely below standard the warm buffet was ice cold because the heaters were turned off the cold buffet was clearly not fresh cheese being dryed out at the edges one of the two coffee machines remained out of use during the complete breakfast because it needed to be refilled luckily breakfast wasn t very crowded
