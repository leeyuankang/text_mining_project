it looks nothing like it does in the pictures at all room is a basic room like a travel lodge was majorly disappointed the hotel is far to over priced i messaged the hotel on the day of my arrival and asking if it would be possible for early check in and i got ignored no response i come to amsterdam a lot and normally stay in apartments but though we would try this hotel out as it looks amazing on pictures but this was false hope and would not pay the price to stay here again
