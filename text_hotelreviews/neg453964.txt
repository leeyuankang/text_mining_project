when we arrived there where no footpaths or even roads we had to walk through a building site a jcb nearly reversed over us and my new shoes that u paid for the day before where tollaly ruined the staff on desk said it wasn t there fault you as a hotel have a duty of care towards your guest and could have put up signage so your guests had a clear and safe footpath to access the hotel in total i ruined two good pair of shoes and could not believe that the hotel thought it was exceptable to have no signage or clear footpath for there guests it s also not a ten minute walk to central it s over min walk and min on the bus
