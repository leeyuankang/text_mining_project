it s supposed to be a stars hotel but there s no one to take care of your luggage the disposition of the rooms isn t clearly explained so we got lost with all our suitcases fortunately a spanish cleaning staff member helped us and explained to me where to go in spanish because he doesn t speak english no one speaks french so my parents couldn t get any help from the staff to open the fridge for example so they had to drink from the tab one of the lady at the entrance desk was haughty and impolite not even a fresh bottle of water was offered the room service is a nightmare late to deliver the breakfast which was incomplete for my parents they had to ask for the rest of what they had ordered and it arrived minutes later when their drinks coffee and chocolate were already cold my breakfast was delivered minutes late so i didn t get to eat before leaving the room is noisy so it s impossible to sleep the car park is awfully expensive run away from this hotel because apart from its great look it has nothing to offer
