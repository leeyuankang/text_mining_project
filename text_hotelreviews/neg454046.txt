our only grumble was the bus stop arriving at the hotel upon leaving the bus two lanes of traffic need to be crossed which is fine however there is then a grassy area before a further carriageway to cross and a small grassy slope to climb a path of bark chippings did appear during our stay but it would be advisable for the hotel to create a more permanent crossing between the carriageways and some steps i know the carriageway is an unsurmountable issue to make the journey across easier having said that it is a minor issue and we loved our stay
