as a traveller this hotel is your worst nightmare we gave staff our credit card details when we checked in we stayed in the cheapest room possible for nights not only did the prices fluctuate dramatically while we were there it wasn t the prices quoted on booking com but our card was charged times after we had left a total of over in payments has been taken out of our account by the hotel since we left a week ago we ve spoken to hotel staff a number of times they said they don t know why it s happened and they ll try and refund it to date we have still not received any of our money back completely ruined our holiday thanks very much art museum hotel
