the property is very dingy the floor lobby is very dark and shady we had rooms including one suite and none faced outside so there was limited external light it was facing the internal atrium the rooms were very small and in the endeavour to make it contemporary and modern some basics and warmth were missing the only highlight would be location they have a nice bar on the top floor but overall for the price wouldn t recommend
