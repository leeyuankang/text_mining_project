not the w experience i was hoping for the hotel has a very minimalistic design without the usual creative touches that one would expect the place ends up looking like a barren factory than a fancy hotel the room i stayed in overlooked the empty courtyard and it was difficult to have any privacy without completely closing the shutters the room while modern did not have a good vibe or the usual bells and whistles one would find at a star hotel also whenever someone closed a door outside you could hear the banging and the noise inside the room it was difficult to get a good sleep in the morning
