the least practical hotel we ve ever stayed in for example the shower is located in the room next to the bed not in a bathroom so it was impossible for someone to sleep while the other one takes a shower even the light switch of the shower and room is the same takes forever to use the elevators a lot of people coming in to the floor combined with slow elevators caused a super long waiting time whenever we wanted to go up to the room not a huge deal but for such an expansive hotel this shouldn t be an issue
