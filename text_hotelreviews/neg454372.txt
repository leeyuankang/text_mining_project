spent the weekend at the w for a birthday and was our first visit to amsterdam notified the hotel before arrival that it was a very special occasion and got the most basic customer service the room was like a hostel i ve never stayed in such a small confined space it took around minutes to check us in and had to keep repeating ourselves i paid per night without breakfast and it s the biggest waste of money i ve ever spent hotel said that they would take a payment instead of preauthorisation as it would go back to my bank faster only to find out that i didn t get as much back as i paid i called to complain and was told a manager would contact me this was a week ago and i still haven t been contacted always been a very loyal starwood member but this has completely put me off using them in future do not stay here it s not worth the money
