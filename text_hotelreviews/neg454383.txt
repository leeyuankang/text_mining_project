only thing i can say was that we had drinks in the bar one night and we paid euros as we come from london we re so used to asking for a single double shot because it s always measured this is clearly not the case in amsterdam asked for double jd s and coke and the guy almost filled the entire glass with jd when i told him that s too much he replied you asked for double i can t throw it away so if your from london be careful when ordering drinks at the bar lol
