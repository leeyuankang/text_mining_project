we were promised a text when our room was ready we walked the length and breadth of amsterdam expecting a text we finally returned to the hotel at to be advised the room was ready but that we should have gone across the road that was fine but when we asked about our luggage no one knew anything whilst this was happening to us other guests were being handed glasses of champagne on check in luckily when we got to our room the bags were there the next day i enquired at the concierge desk in the side of the hotel we were staying in and was directed across the road then yesterday we arrived back from a day of sightseeing to a room that hadn t been serviced also despite having the air con turned down to its lowest temperature we found the room quite stuffy at night
