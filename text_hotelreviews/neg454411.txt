really disappointing stay we had a wonderful bank with canal view we had to crawl up the couch to see the canal the rooms at w bank on the fourth floor are a rip off overall the room felt like living in a cave real dark low ceilings when we asked for another room we were told that this is not possible overbooked staff was overall really friendly but due to lack of personnel everything did take very long check in minutes luggage got lost waited two hours so not a wonderul stay for our honeymoon at w definetely below average starwood hotel standard been in starwood hotels in croatia and barcelona
