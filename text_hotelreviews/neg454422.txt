if you book your room from booking com and choose to pay at the hotel this is very important carefully read entrance to the hotel at the reception we said our names and the reception guy checked his computer and said us to pay more than our booking com price we said it s not good why we need to pay more than book price he said he can t do anything this is the price after we showed the booking com reservation document he looked min after said ok pay the reservation document says if you don t want to be surprised at the entrance don t forget to show your booking reservation document
