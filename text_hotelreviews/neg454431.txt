we checked into the w for five nights on arrival i saw a stain on the top sheet won t say what it looked like yuk to their credit it took maybe all if five minutes to send someone to the room and change the bedding day two we returned from our first outing at about to find that our room had been passed over by housekeeping i phoned and was told that they weren t sure they could send someone because they very busy someone did eventually turn up telling us it was her last call of the day they usually work in pairs but she was alone she did not vacuum the carpet or clean the stucco floor and the sheets were not changed even though i d left the card requesting it basically she just made up the bed changed the towels and took out the garbage later i went to reception to complain and was told politely that it s highly unlikely our room had been passed over as they work until six really so my call was unnecessary i don t think so they sent someone else later to ask if everything was ok full points for that but for the actual cleaning day four they hadn t provided any fresh towels i had to phone to request them they sent someone straight away but for a five star hotel in a major european capital i don t think it s good enough
