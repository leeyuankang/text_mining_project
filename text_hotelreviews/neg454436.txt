front desk staff is untrained and not up to w standards first room assigned was dirty cleaning clothe found by the sink then the second room assigned was occupied the management was slow to solve the issues encountered as a recovery we received euros credit but one of our dinners was double posted at checkout when noticed we didn t receive any apology and it was handled like if it was normal besides even tough we had prepaid our room and gave cash guarantee for our incidentals they took a pre authorisation without advising us and again no apologies for the inconvenience they were unable to cancel the preauthorisation on the spot the fd agent kept saying that it will be done automatically which is not true overall a succession of frustrations due to lack of professionalism we will definitely come back to amsterdam to mr porter s but we will not stay in the hotel we hope that our comment will help the fd team to improve their operations
