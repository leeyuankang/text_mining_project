the up selling of a canal view room was pretty aggressive i had to decline many times even if you want it i recommend declining until they offer you a discounted rate at the desk i believe it went from a eur down to eur a night regardless we opted for a quiet room with no view and it truly had no view as expected but it was also at one end of the hotel so it was super quiet
