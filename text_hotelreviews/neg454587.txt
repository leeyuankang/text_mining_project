be careful with your expectations of the sleeping arrangements here i thought we had booked a room with double bed but arrived to find they only had a twin available for us when i queried this i was told that nh hotels only guarantee a room for two people when you book and that rooms with double beds are dependent on availability not good when you have booked four weeks ahead and specified what you want i felt i wouldn t use an nh hotel again for this reason
