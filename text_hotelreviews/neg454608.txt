i booked and payed euro a superior room for and ended up in a very small double room like the one for single use the stuff is not in particular friendly and interessted in the guests i was never asked if i liked the stay there they charged extra fee for room deposit which i only will get back in a few days strange habit the breakfast area is like a big cantine with guests running around the counters i saw nicer smaller places near by where friends stayed for same or even less price
