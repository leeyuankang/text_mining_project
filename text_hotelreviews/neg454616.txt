our double room which cost over euros a night was so small that it had space for only one bedside table this was despite the fact that it was advertised on booking com as having a seating area and space for a spare bed if necessary the hotel offers no facilities such a computer printing etc and the breakfast is uninspired further the hotel takes an extra euro deposit which takes several days weeks to refund even after the bill has been fully paid overall this does not feel like a four star experience despite the four star price tag
