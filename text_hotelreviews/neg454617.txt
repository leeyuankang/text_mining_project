rooms very small plus they charged me for extra for parking without telling me and i don t even have a car and when i go to them asking about that they told me oh it s a mistake and we will refund it to you after weeks and after long talk explaining that it s there mistake and they can t just take money from people just like that they refunded it to me in cash and you will carry your luggage from main entrance to your room coz they don t have someone to do it
