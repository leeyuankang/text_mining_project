i booked a double room but was given a twin room was told room preference was subject to availability and blamed booking com when i said that wasn t made clear to me or that i wasn t informed that my preference wasn t available until i got there this was a little disappointing i was told i could have a double room if i was prepared to pay extra but at almost euro for nights i thought i was already paying enough
