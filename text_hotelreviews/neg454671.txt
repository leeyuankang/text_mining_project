we checked into the hotel at three o clock to which we were told we needed to pay euros for city tax and then euro deposit incase we use anything from the mini bar which we weren t informed about so be prepared with extra cash you do get it back in check out we went to our rooms and my overall feeling was that it was very small and not as spacious as the photos neither was the red carpets outside it was black on inspection the room was clean to a high standard we left our stuff and went out till late evening and our dooor was definitely locked as we checked several times we come back into our room using the key card and i was desperate for the loo i go into the bathroom to be absolutely outraged to find that someone had been into our room and had a poo in our toilet and it was left in there i was absolutely furious we had been in the bathroom before we left and it wasn t there before we left we rang reception and explained how angry we were that someone had been in our room and done this we explained that we were very unhappy about staying in a room that other people clearly had access to we asked them to come to the room and witness for themselves the horrific mess left in our bathroom they said they would call us back after speaking to a manager at this point i thought j was going to wet myself it took so long for them to call back didn t want to use the loo as t was filthy they eventually called back at around midnight and said we could upgrade to a superior suite we went k reception and collected our new keys we went to our new room and was very disappointed by the size of the room i thought our last room was small but this was ridiculous you had to walk sideways to get around the little space there was you could probably touch all the walls at once i called back and said we were still unhappy
