very cold in the room the ac does not working properly although was on all night and although it is mentioned that it may take up to minutes to warm the radiator was hot only on the first day as the weather was cloudy and rainy on the next day as the weather became warmer the radiator is no heat anymore eur guarantee is too much for a minibar on which you have only few beverages and which is not even cooling
