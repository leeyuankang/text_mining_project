requested a double bed on booking form and got single beds room cleaning was unreliable and inefficient re filled mini fridge but didn t clean room or replace towels then put do not clean sign back on door really disappointed as i don t feel it was a cheap option to stay there lots of other hotels cheaper but went for this as expected good things
