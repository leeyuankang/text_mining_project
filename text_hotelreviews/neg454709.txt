i just had a terrible experience at nh city center in amsterdam it is a pity its decay in service and comfort i had stayed there for a couple of times before less than ten years ago i decided to give it a new try from nov to bad idea the elegant old fashioned design is gone all over lobby and rooms it is all now in the same ugly formica style new decoration we find in any cheap hotel but nh city center prouds itself to be a four stars it can be on paper in which concerns beauty and confort it is at most a three and in service forget about it the staff is arrogant or incompetent or both forget the promise of space and a room with a view we ve got a if so and just one of the three windows facing a canal the others showed ugly roofs so if they give you the key to room just say no no cleaning in the first day before at least pm even as asked with a signal in the door when i called the lobby attendant answered they had not finish the service yet no complaining no rush the cleaning by the way is lousy don t expect ponctuality at the delivery back of the laundry it was late of course without any info or excuses of course and i had to ask for it three times one last thing to keep this short in the departure day beforehand in the morning i asked at the front office for a late check out to pm just one hour later than the usual the girl in charge told me yes of course the key has stopped working at noon and another girl from the front office call me at pm to tell me the check out time was noon of course i just picked up my luggage passed by the front office and took a cab to departure to never again stay or allow any friend or aquaintance to stay at nh city center
