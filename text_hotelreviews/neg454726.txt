i think that the check in and the checking out process vould be far more efficient as both seemed drawn out our room was booked excluding breakfast but we chose to take breakfast on our last day as we paid in cash in full on check in including a mini bar deposit the hotel records showed we had no credit and the waitress seemed to struggle to book us in and charge it to our room we were seated and were expecting to settle the bill on check out but the waitress was extremely panicked by the fact she couldn t charge the breakfast there and then and wouldn t leave us to eat in peace she wanted to escort us to the desk to sort it with reception before we d finished not very professional at all
