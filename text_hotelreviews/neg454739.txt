i paid a substantial amount of mula for the xtra large superior room and got a tiny room for the first night i was then moved into a larger room after complaining but the staff blamed booking com for lying about the size of the room after i pointed out they used photos from their website and that i paid extra for a extra large room they agreed to move me for the remainder of my stay the hotel would of happily left me in the box room i was never reinburst for the first night you also have to pay a deposit on arrival that they say you get back took at least weeks after our holiday for it to be returned
