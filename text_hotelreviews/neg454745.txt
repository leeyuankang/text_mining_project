when we arrived at hotel it was shortly after o clock in the day we proceeded to check in and this is where we hit the problem we where told our room was given away as we had not registered with the hotel before now i have stayed in lots and lots of hotels and never heard of such a thing so please bear this in mind when you are checking in though the girls on the desk sorted it all out for us and provided us with a complimentary drink while we waited
