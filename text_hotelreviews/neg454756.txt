when we checked in they gave us a tiny room with single beds we requested a double bed we had no other choice but to pay to upgrade as it was late the other room was better however the bed was squeaky and moved about the room was equally very small pictures on the website are misleading the free wifi didn t work and the tv kept loosing signal overall not impressed for the price we paid
