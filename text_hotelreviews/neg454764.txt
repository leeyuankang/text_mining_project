very noisey hotel we was on the floor and there was floors above us could hear every door close and every foot step people took above us apart from this we turned up at the airport at way past the allowed check in time only to be told our room was not ready and to come back in mins after a hr flight this is somthing we was not at all happy with just wanting a shower and a chill they offered no re fund or upgrade or any appolagie for this for a star expensive hotel this is very unacceptable in my opinion
