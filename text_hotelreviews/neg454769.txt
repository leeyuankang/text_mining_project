as a couple we booked a double room with a double bed however when we entered our room there was single beds we contacted reception and they advised there was nothing they could do as there was no other rooms with double beds available it was not until we asked for the manger and highlighted repeatedly that we booked a double bed did we receive any acknowledgement of their mistake we were then offered complimentary breakfast the following morning along with a change of room the next day when we were checking out they tried to charge us for the breakfast however when we explained the situation to the receptionist she quickly removed if from the bill however given the mess up they should have insured that was noted and did not appear on the bill
