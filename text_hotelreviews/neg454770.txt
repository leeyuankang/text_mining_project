first we were offered a room without a window it didn t say that when we booked the room mins after seeing that room we went back to the reception and it was not possible to receive the full payment back nh keeps the amount they reserved on your credit card for around weeks before it is released again when we tried to change the staff was friendly but still the price is way too high for what you get namely being put in a twin room with an extra bed which had been stored in a dirty archive we waited several hours to get the extra bed i wouldn t recommend this hotel unless you probably book the room with view
