staff attitude towards customer understaffed for a star property for every request even housekeeping related has to go to the reception which itself has mostly staff at max for any maintainence request they only have one answer we can t help it in fact we hired rooms and some channels appearing in kids room were not coming in our room so everyday we placed a request but they simply said it can t be done the warmth itself is missing in the staff attitude towards customers thus not giving a nice feeling upon check in i told the agent that kindly give us good room while the reply was ok we only have good rooms the way it was delivered it more seemed like f you coming to rooms i can t believe the difference in room size in the two rooms one was nice and big while other was percent of the size i paid the same amount of money for each room but after the check in experience i decided not to raise any request again
