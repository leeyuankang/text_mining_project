cleaning of the rooms below expectation considering it was a superior room and per night without breakfast had to ring most days to ask about if room was going to be cleaned missing towels etc etc when it was cleaned it wasn t cleaned properly very disappointing for the star too robes and slippers were also not provided even though it stated it would be in a superior room didn t complain as wouldn t have used them but it was the principal of it wifi hit and miss superior rooms meant to have sound proofing but could hear exactly what was going on in the next room even running the bathroom tap i m sure there are better about for the money wouldn t go back to that hotel
