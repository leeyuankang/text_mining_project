this property presents a facade of an up to date hotel it is definitely not what it appears to be the reception staff three individuals at different times became surly and argumentative when i had to correct their wrong assumption they also had no explanation why the room was not ready on check in past the stipulated time the cleaning staff is unaware that if you place the please clean now sign on the door at am you have the right to expect that at the room will be clean the room was dirty candy in the shape of hearts were in the corner perhaps left from valentine s day this was early august also the housekeeping person failed on three of the four days to replace the body wash and shampoo even though the empty bottles were in full view the housekeeper also failed to replenish the notepad even though it had been only used to indicate that the four euro on it were for her the beds do not have electrical outlets so if you use a cpap machine or other devise you are out of luck unless you bring your own extension cord the shower was so constructed that a person slightly larger than average size could not enter it someone had obviously ordered the glass partitions without measuring the opening there was no coffee maker in what was described as a premium room only a water heater with instant coffee who drinks instant coffee in the website for the hotel advertises a refrigerator in the room but going back to my original comment concerning the facade that is created the refrigerator in the room was so filled with their overpriced items that you could not place even the smallest item of your own in there they had even removed the shelves on the door to crowd more of their items in it all in all this was a hotel to be avoided to be clear i have stayed in other nh hotels in amsterdam brussels and berlin i certainly hope that this property is an enigma
