when checking in we were asked to pay deposit that would be paid back at check out giving that we didn t use the mini bar or had any snacks euro was abit of a shock to us as we were not informed of this before booking we later found out that we should have only had to pay a euro deposit and that the girl checking us in charged way to much and they couldn t understand stand why she wanted we did get i back but it was alot of our spending money gone which was an inconvenience for us
