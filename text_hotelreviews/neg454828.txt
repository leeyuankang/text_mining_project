our room wasn t cleaned after our first night when we left the hotel to go out at we requested that someone do so but when we came back at it still hadn t been cleaned i complained and found the staff very unhelpful considering the situation the next day by it still hadn t been cleaned even though we had a cleaning sign up on our door since and when to went to complain there were no apologies only more rude attitudes it was finally cleaned once in three days but i feel the hotel really dropped the ball here and it made the stay unpleasant another thing was that upon check in we were told that they had no more double rooms and that we could take two single beds we had requested a double room and were disappointed but apparently it s not guaranteed our other option was to upgrade which was fine because the superior room was lovely but it did feel a bit forced at check in and left a bit of a sour taste i would recommend the hotel but they really need to check in on the cleaning issue and improve the attitudes of the front desk staff
