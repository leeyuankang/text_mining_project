the second day we arrive at the hotel both my bag and my friends bag zipper were bust open and the pockets were open and my friends sunglasses and case were gone we locked our bags with a locker but still someone manage to go through our stuff poor cleaning some staff at the recepcion were rude there was one time when a guest went to a recepcionist because his key card wasnt working and instead of making a key which takes seconds she yell at his saying he needed to wait because he was annoying her also the room was a lot smaller than showed in the pictures
