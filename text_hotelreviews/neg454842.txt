on the second day we returned after a days sightseeing to find the room flooded from the aircon system when i went to reception i was told to switch the aircon off and that will cure the problem what they failed to accept was that this was a major leak that had soaked shoes and luggage it took over mins to get a manager to accept that there was a problem we were then moved to another room that was noisy and not as comfortable the hotel did give a small discount but it really spoilt our stay
