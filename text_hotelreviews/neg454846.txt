when we arrived we booked room for adults and kid they wanted to put us in rooms bc they said they dont allow that that this was bookings com fault when i showed them what it was published and that they say they let kids in the room they had no other option that give us rooms instead of but when you are on holidays you dont want that kind of poor attention right then we said we wanted breakfast they said ok and the following morning we had problems even the lady at the entrance of the breakfast was threathening us poor attention that kind of hotel needs better customer service
