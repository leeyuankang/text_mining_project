triple room had a small window facing into an inner courtyard and was very dark but for one night it wasn t really a problem the air conditioning unit in our room leaked and we had to put a waste bin under it but it happened in the morning before checking out so didn t cause us any problems price for one night was very high but it seems all hotel rooms in amsterdam in may were expensive
