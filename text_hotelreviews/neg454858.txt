we were not given the room we booked which was a quadruple room we were placed on a superior double which will not accomodate our family demi one of the receptionist was very rude explaining to us that our booking was not in their system i think she should be very apologetic to us for not giving us our booked room in the first place she must be taught how to handle customers very well however the manager arranged everything and apologized for the inconvenience we were given a triple room instead and another double room to accomdate us all the manager gave us night free for one of the rooms thanks to the manager when you place the clean up my room sign i noticed they just fixed the beds changed the towels but not clean the room especially the bathroom too bad it could have been one of our favorite hotels we have been traveling a lot in different parts of the world and never had we experienced like this one educated people should act like educated people
