the staff were fine but not exceptional i arrived with two kids at their official check in time is despite my advance written request to access a room an hour early there was no wiggle room on the check in time and no rush to get our room ready later i asked to borrow a cork screw no one would help always referring me to someone else despite there being plenty of staff and no other guests to help any of these things can happen but the indifference to customer inconvenience was disappointing finally when i asked to settle the bill the night before my early morning departure i felt like i was inconveniencing them nothing went wrong the place was pretty decent the staff were all polite however the little things that surround customer comfort were not a priority
