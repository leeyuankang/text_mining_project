a bit too expensive for the same price you can have a much better room in a hotel in switzerland the hotel recommended a nearby restaurant it had potential and wanted to be very gourmet by didn t quite deliver don t know if the hotel was undergoing restoration but certain details were overlooked like the elevator door with the paint all scratched up paint stains on the bathroom floor all in all a good hotel but that s it
