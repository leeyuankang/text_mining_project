we were booked in a standard room wanted a larger room and were willing to pay as well they upgraded us to a junior suite as no other larger room was available for more than gbp to our utter shock we realised that the so called junior suite was located outside the main building on ground floor the junior suite had connectivity issues and no network was available we complained about it as well the duty manager offered to change the room as soon as she could get one but we were not keen to stay in different rooms for nights the duty manager then agreed to waive off the upgrade charges when i asked her to consider our plight she gave a further discount on our stay
