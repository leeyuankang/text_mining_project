staff really not that friendly or attentive to details nothing like the fabulous staff at the wellesley drinks offer as mentioned above only included soft drinks also worth noting that i was aware the hotel had lots of empty rooms the night we stayed seems a shame for the staff not to offer a room upgrade even for a small fee
