the property is very nicely maintained but tired regarding the room part of the view was a tile wall across an alley we had what was billed as an upgraded king room which was so small that it did not have room to place a suitcase on a rack it was difficult to get from the far side of the bed to the door bathroom there was only one useable drawer the tub was elevated and doubled as shower it was dangerously difficult to stand in it the finishes were dated and for example the lamps were just plain cheap i do not think that the hotel qualifies as five star based on the rooms
