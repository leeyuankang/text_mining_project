the room was a little tight really the bathroom really needs a do over mouldy grouting mastic for a place that costs around per night should be better maintained main gripe would be the breakfast for the breakfast is pretty steep i d say yes you can have fruit croissants and fry up fish eggs florentine etc but really how much can you eat for the cherry on the top of the was the service charges that they pop onto the bill at the end which you can red facedly ask them to take off but lets face it not many would one charge at per day and another at around per day bringing the daily cost of breakfast to for people which i think is rather galling shame as the was enough to bare to begin with
