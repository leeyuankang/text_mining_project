we were sent a form prior to arrival about requirements etc for the room it also asked if it was a special occasion which it was our wedding nothing was done for that or even mentioned by the staff seems rather pointless in asking if one is not going to do something special also the bar has a great atmosphere filled with memorabilia however a bit of attention needs to paid to the cleaning of the objects there was a lot of dust on some of the pictures
