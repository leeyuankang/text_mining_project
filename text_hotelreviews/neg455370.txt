for over per night i would have expected better service i ordered a pot of tea to be delivered to the lounge area which i had been told was available and no one seemed to know how to accomplish that after minutes it still hadn t arrived when i asked about it it was obvious that the order had been lost and it was another minutes for it to arrive there was no outlet in the bathroom for a hair dryer they had special plugs for electric razors but the hair dryer furnished by the hotel couldn t be plugged in i had to use it in the bedroom which was disruptive to family members who were still trying to sleep a light bulb was out in the bathroom and no one noticed for a couple of days even with all light bulbs burning the lighting in the bathroom was terrible it was so dark it was difficult to put on makeup there was a new year s eve event in the restaurant which overflowed into the lounge area for hotel guests we came back to relax for a while between dinner and fireworks and had to sit it our room for over hours since we couldn t use the hotel s public spaces this is my fourth trip to london and i will be returning to the hotel i have stayed in before won t be back
