the wifi service was terrible with receptionist asking for firewall to be removed on the computer before a wifi service could be provided the breakfast chefs were very poor to the point of being ridiculous for being a star hotel kippers served in a big pile min after request the next day traditional english breakfast served min after request very poorly cooked sunny side up eggs were baked scrambled eggs were runny to be point of being half cooked in essence this hotel wins on style but loses out completely on detail not a star proposition at all
