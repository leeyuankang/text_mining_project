i was upgraded to a superior room which was a smoking room this was not pleasant and i woke to a strong smell of smoke which resulted in an irritation to my sinuses and my breathing in addition it was adjacent to the outside seating area in the bar which meant it was noisy until quite late then once the clients had all finished there was a lot of noise of bottles and empties being moved in the morning there was a lot of noise early on for me this spoilt what should have been a very relaxing overnight stay and as a result i did not stay in london to enjoy myself sunday but drove home as i was tired and felt i needed the rest please give more consideration to non smokers that means under no circumstances do we wish to experience second hand smoke in any situation
