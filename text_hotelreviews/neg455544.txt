just seemed like a normal hotel with no real omph and no real pullback as to why we would stay again full of people who wanted to know everyone s business and parking is terrible bedrooms are compact but comfortable again first come first serve for the best views the air con didn t really seem to work was very poor so had to open windows for air bar is next to venue rooms so we had weddings so was fairly noisey and then it kicked off outside excellent base for adventures and sightseeing can t fault that
