the room was tiny even though it was an executive room the view which is why i booked the room was mainly of a brick wall with a view of the river and the far end of butlers wharf the nespresso machine in the room was dirty so i didn t even attempt to use it for breakfast in the room the sausages were sour mushooms were water drenched bacon overcooked and too hard to cut with a knife and the scrambled eggs were solid and you also needed a knife to cut them into bite size pieces the local roads have had new restrictions added so the hotel access road is used to turn around by drivers who block the access exit from the property as a result my taxi took minutes to get me to my destination minutes after my meeting had started
