executive room and club lounge were a waste of money staff didn t top up the food and service at breakfast was dreadful no food then no plates no cups and took over minutes to wait for each thing that was missing in the evening the staff were more concerned at welcoming back a couple who were not even staying in the hotel but had come up to see if staff that they knew were there they were not and everyone else was ignored
