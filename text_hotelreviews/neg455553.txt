the meal in the brasserie was not good at all we both decided to have what is advertised as fresh cod fillet what arrived was awful frozen fish and after we told the staff we were told that yes the fish is frozen sir for fact we could have purchased a box of frozen cod fillets at waitrose for about and not paid a total of for two when we complained were offered a free cup coffee with the meal in addition to this very poor food we were most annoyed at having the staff moving and laying up tables for breakfast around us all the time were were eating very poor food and very poor service from a hotel off this class
