hotel is a little tired bed was comfortable but room has seen better days never seen such an antiquated hairdryer lifts broken and guests had to use staff staircase very busy at breakfast food was cold and limited we were unhappy with standard of our room and asked for a manager to call us they did not make contact at all which is disappointing for a hotel in this price bracket however the location is fantastic
