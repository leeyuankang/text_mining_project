long queue for check in unhelpful since i was late very slow lifts also again slightly frustrating also rather odd at breakfast not included in my room and was it a fuss to get it booked to my room bill the room card wasn t enough i had to show my key implication i suppose that i d wandered in and possibly found someone s room card then i was presented with a bill and when i asked again if it could be put on the room i was queried as to if i had enough credit on the room quite a security fuss over maybe i look like a random breakfast thief something i will reflect on otherwise the staff were very pleasant and breakfast was the usual standard stuff
