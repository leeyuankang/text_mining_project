we ve been coming to the tower hotel for years whenever in london it is still a great location but over the years it has very gradually become less special though in their defense the prices have remained very competitive on arrival we upgraded to an executive room which was really no bigger with twin beds that were rather narrow for adults not particularly executive at all furnishings were rather large and left very little space to walk around bed we would have been just as well staying with a standard room and saved the extra cost
