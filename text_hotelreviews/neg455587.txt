there was air con and the room temperature was but the worst was that they didn t do anything to help me they didn t even offer me to change room so that i could have a window or something to make the situation better i should have wifi but i forgot to ask about and nobody reminded me of it while in all other hotels i have stayed up to now they all inform you about things like that
