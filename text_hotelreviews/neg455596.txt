the restaurant menu was quite boring and staff not attentive the coffee served after the meal supposedly a cappuccino was bitter and undrinkable service at breakfast was indifferent i had to send back my tea which was stewed on reflection there are an amazing number of eateries close by issue with staff training no one has given them a sense of service and care over the way things are done
