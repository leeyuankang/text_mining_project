the room is quite dated the ironing board does not stand on its own so had to hold it to be able to iron our clothes there was no fridge there used to be in the room but was nailed and no mini bar is available now would have been nice to have cold drinking water without requesting for ice from room service the room was very warm too and the aircon does not work either we were only staying for one night and checked in late so no point to have our room changed
