check in was slow and frustrating we arrived before our rooms we booked were ready which was not a problem but the check in guy took our details anyway to speed up check in when we came back at the correct time when we came back they said we did not have a reservation no lift from the car park to reception reception area a bit dated and needs decoration in one of our rooms the tv did not work and in spite of several phone calls nobody ever came to sort it in the other room the tv picture was terrible the outside of the building could be more attractive and would benefit from a good scrub
