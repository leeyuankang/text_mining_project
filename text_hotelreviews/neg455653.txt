in comparison to other local hotels at a similar or lower price the rooms are antiquated it seems you pay for the view which admittedly is stunning if your a re fortunate to get a room overlooking tower bridge air conditioning is antiquated and not working heating only in both of the rooms i have recently stayed in had to turn it off and open the windows power sockets are limited only one at the desk in both the rooms i have stayed in the other is on the wall under the window in the first room the socket was positioned so low to the desk that the moulded plug could not be inserted poor show unable to get receipt at checkout as my email address was stored as booking com even after i corrected it at check in as requested however if you use the express checkout and put your email address on the envelope you do get a receipt why
