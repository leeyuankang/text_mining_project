the first room we were allocated was extremely small and as i am partially disabled was difficult to get around we were given a complementary upgrade to a family room with a stunning view over the bridge however the room itself was dark old fashioned and looked like it hadn t been decorated since the room selection is very important at this hotel as they are far from standard
