i was rudely asked not to help myself to alcoholic beverages from the fridge in the executive lounge at as this was not allowed until and my actions would cause others to want a drink early i apologised that i hadn t realised is was not yet as the gentleman opposite me had a bottle of beer and the fridge was not locked otherwise how would i have got the bottle out the waiter clearly unimpressed walked away to check the fridge obviously finding it to indeed be unlocked he then reluctantly appogised explaining that he would allow me to keep my drink as a member of staff not him must have opened it for my remaining time in the lounge this waiter did not come back to my table and walked around looking clearly annoyed which i found a little rude and silly also the following morning the information stated muffins cookies and fruit would be available in the lounge from when i left the lounge at these were yet to seen after my experience the previous night i didn t dare to ask the waiter
