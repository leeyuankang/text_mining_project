the brassiere the service was poor our individual waiter was apologetic and polite but still did not provide good service we had to ask for ketchup times and by the time it arrived the french fries were cold he got another order but by this time the meal was over one person got their meal minutes ahead of everyone else we asked for checks and we did not get that the checks were re worked however they were incorrect and charged only to the other couple so i had to settle up with them inconvenient
