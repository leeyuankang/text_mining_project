felt the room which we had been given was pretty poor no side table on one side of the bed so had to put belongings on the floor also no side lamp either side of the bed but then had excessive amounts of lighting round the dressing table booked this hotel as a treat for me and my partner as i was proposing that weekend and the room left us both feeling like you get a far better room from a premier inn type company also good view from the room but the room next to us could see straight into our room from there window so kept the curtains drawn
