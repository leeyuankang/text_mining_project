i find checking in out a little slow and rather confusing when i checked in i was told the total price of the three rooms i had booked and then entered my pin number into the card machine and so presumed i had completed the necessary payment process but then when i checked out i found out that i had only paid for one of the rooms and then had to make two more separate payments for each of the other two rooms it was difficult to understand what the receptionist was trying to explain and she felt it necessary to ask her manager to help
