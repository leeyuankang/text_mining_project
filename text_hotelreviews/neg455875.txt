check in process was abysmal did not expect to arrive at hotel and to have to queue from outside the front door took half an hour to be seen and then at that point the member of staff on reception told us that our room had been cancelled we had certainly not cancelled it it took her several attempts to sort it out and despite us asking to see a manager we re still waiting perhaps a manager intends to call and visit us at our home address the experience of having to queue for minutes in order to get our breakfast was not particularly inspiring either at check in we had been advised that there would be two restaurants open for breakfast as the hotel was obviously busy and seemingly unable to cope with so many guests it seemed that they were hosting a staff event for top shop top man but in the end there was only one restaurant open and it was chaotic this along with the check in experience left a poor impression of the hotel
