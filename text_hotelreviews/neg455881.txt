check in was chaotic we never came into the hotel without encountering a waiting line the evening we arrived there seemed to be issues with lots of booking as people were complaining about wrong room assignments all around us in the middle of it all we were informed that the bridge view room we had paid for was not available and we were offered a twin we refused as we wanted a double and eventually they got us a standard double room we were then offered a complimentary upgrade to an executive bridge room for our night which was most welcome in fairness the view from the standard room out over the docks behind the hotel was lovely the night in the exec room was really great and the club lounge was a very nice touch but overall they really need to work on their front desk operations staff were lovely but too often there wasn t enough of them available i saw many guests getting irate and demanding more staff be brought out to alleviate the queues
