having pre paid for a business trip for my international guests i was informed in writting and via telephone after much effort that no one would be required to provide a credit card upon check in all guests were then not given keys without giving credit card details and one had to pay for her room even though it had already been paid for this is the second year this has been an issue and was awful service for our important business partners
