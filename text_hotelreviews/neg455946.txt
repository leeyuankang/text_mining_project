the main elevators were very slow and it appeared to me not really suited to hotel size and during busy periods you had to use service lifts or stairs with luggage i understand this may have been that due to some being out of service so perhaps it was only a temporary glitch during the weekend i visited hope so rooms are clean and comfortable perhaps little dated by other top london hotel chain standards but for a short break its good value for money and if location is your main concern it is ideal
