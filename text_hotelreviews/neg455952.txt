we were slightly surprised by size of room expected slightly bigger obviously disappointed that we didn t have a nicer view especially as it was a treat for my husband s birthday but appreciate it s first come first served but we were only in the room to sleep the room could have done with its own bin rather than using the one in the bathroom
