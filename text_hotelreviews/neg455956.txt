the room is old and small need major renovation bath room is small clearly saw the age of this room by counting how many holes on the walls wardrobe was old and tore due to age and lack of good maintenance door to the room is so difficult to push open and it springs back to close in such a force that you will weak up all the rooms around you window is small and you can see your next neighbor sitting on his her bed reading yes it is that close so you have to close the curtain all the time go back to the toilet the seat is loose and it took at least flushes everything to clear even a tissue i will not recommend this hotel for leisure but i guess that it will be good for short stay for business as there s offices blocks in this location
