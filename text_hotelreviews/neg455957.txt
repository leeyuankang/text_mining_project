the bar was not open until on a saturday even though in the room information book it said that the bar opened from late at a weekend when we asked where we could get a drink from after a long journey the staff told us that the brassiere was serving the staff in the brassiere basically ignored you and were more busy clearing up after lunch i even saw them tell a man with a disabled son he had to go to the bar himself to get a drink leaving his son outside alone
