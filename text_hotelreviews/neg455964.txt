the prices in the bar were the highest we have seen the bar was in a super location overlooking tower bridge but the price of the drinks there were far to high we would have loved to had a few drinks at the bar but we could not afford too we drank at a nearby hotel where friends of ours were staying where there was a large difference in the price
