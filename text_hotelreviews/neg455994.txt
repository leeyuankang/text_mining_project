it s more nitpicking than anything else but the faucets in the bathroom sink one for cold water and one for hot water have too short a neck so you rub against the sink in order to wash your hands not a problem but something for the hotel to perhaps think about also by having them separate you can t get a medium temperature when washing hands or brushing your teeth you either get cold or hot the bathroom is not too spacious but it s not uncomfortable the toilet is a little tight spaced which might make it difficult for larger people
