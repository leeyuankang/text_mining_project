the room wasn t very well maintained and quite small dated for the price there were chunks missing out of one wall a badly done repair in another no tea and coffee because we got a standard view room and we couldn t operate the air conditioning there were no instructions it was baking lots of places where the varnish and paintwork could have done with touching up and for the price we paid i m not sure why that couldn t be done i know it was standard room but i thought the guoman brand would have higher standards of presentation even at the lower price end
