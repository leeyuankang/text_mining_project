customer service was shockingly bad we had a group booking and they messed up the check in for a number of rooms it was painful trying to resolve the problem and the man on reception wouldn t take responsibility for the mistakes he had the courage to admit when something wasn t his fault a disgrace don t stay there unless you love hassle and unhelpful staff
