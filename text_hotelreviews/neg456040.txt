minute queue for breakfast i have never experienced this before at a costly hotel it felt like being at school i would not stay here again for this reason especially given the price when i got to the room i couldn t work out how to turn on the lights as i hadn t realised there was a master switch which is a bit stupid of me however i walked past a maid just outside my room so i thought i would open the door to ask her she avoided eye contact and just said no no i thought this was really poor if you are going to have staff working at the hotel at least train them to say i m sorry but i don t speak english
