the hotel might need a little modernisation especially in the bedrooms we were allocated room our bathroom had a slight odour of stagnant water from the plug holes and this was very apparent at night this may have been due to lack of occupation of our particular room before we arrived the problem was sorted simply by putting the plugs in the plug holes the bathroom door had a weird creak to it when closing and this was very much apparent especially when my significant other was asleep and i needed to use the bathroom and vice versa other than the two minor aforementioned gripes we had a wonderful time at the tower hotel and we would highly recommend it
