check in we had to queue but was dealt with well the breakfast service was poor we were shown to a table in the neville suite area and the breakfast buffet was in a tight corridor and there was no bowls plates sausages or mushrooms which we had to get from the other room whilst the rest of our food was getting cold the tea was slow to arrive and only choices of cereal in our corridor not good it must be like this every weekend at peak times staff need to be better organised a refill crockery quicker
