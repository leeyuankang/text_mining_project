for the price we would have had more room and a more comfy bed in a premier inn the hallway and room was like a sauna we couldn t see where to turn it down and the windows only open a little which is no good in a room so hot xi bar is advertised as being open all day which it wasn t and then silly little things like pictures aren t straight on the wall and there are marks from i m guessing the trolleys along the walls doesn t look good for what is meant to be a hotel that prides themselves on excellence shame as the hotel had been recommended to me
