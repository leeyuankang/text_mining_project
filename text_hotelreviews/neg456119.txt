the booking in process was dreadful they coundn t find our booking left us standing there for mins with no feedback just kept saying they are trying to contact bookings had copies of hte booking com confirmation i had to ask to sit down with a coffee after another mins i went to complain about the wait only to be told well the official booking in time is after its was by this time they kept saying dont worry we will fond you a room only then did i insist if that was the case they could book me in now and then sort it out later which they then did total time to book it mins there were others having the same problem form other booking sites so i think it there problem staff were not very helpful or understanding
