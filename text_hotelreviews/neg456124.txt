i booked this hotel back in feb for myself my husband and year old daughter we booked an executive room as i was told this would be large enough for a bed for my daughter and also a tower view for the new years celebrations the room was tiny and we did not have a view of the tower we were on the back over looking the docks we were moved after i complained the breakfast in the executive lounge was shocking
