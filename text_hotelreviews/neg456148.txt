a reception was always busy b i was paying for a group but they made it very difficult to prepay all the rooms each room had to be paid separately and in the end they did not take the payment merely pre authorised my card which meant i had to attend reception again for each person checking out c i stayed three nights but they made me change rooms every night which was rather inconvenient
