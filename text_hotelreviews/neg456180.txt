breakfast the information on the room card was different to the info displayed at the dining hall the room card showed a later time for breakfast we then ended up coming to breakfast at the end of the scheduled timeslot because of this we didn t get tea had to ask times for a cup of tea we also had little choice in the buffet service was poorer which is not at all usual for the hotel restaurant
