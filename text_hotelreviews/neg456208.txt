i think a hotel of this standard should include two armchairs not one and a dressing table chair when i requested one on our first night i was informed that there wasn t one available on the second day i was looking through the hotel guide and noticed that a carvery was on friday saturday and sunday on questioning the lobby staff nobody knew what a carvery was as most of them were foreign and probably never heard the word carvery so i requested to speak to a manager no one was available i was told but later an under manager appeared at our door and i explained about the carvery and showed him the hotel guide which he said was out of date he knew about the chair request from the previous day and he arranged for one to be delivered to our room he also presented an up to date guide with no carvery mentioned in the bar later i requested a drambuie only to be told there wasn t any available in any of the bars on questioning the bar manager he informed me that various spirits and beers had been removed due to management policy i think this is a big mistake as any drink should be available in a hotel of this standard
