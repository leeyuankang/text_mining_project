we stayed there twice over a day period the first room was not great we had no view and looked out over air conditioning ventilation ducts the air conditioning was poor room very warm however as we wee only staying overnight we weren t in room long enough for it to be a massive issue the suite upgrade was much appreciated and made the last night of our holiday a very pleasurable and memorable one
