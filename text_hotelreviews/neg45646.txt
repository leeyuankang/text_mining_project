the rooms were cramped and there was hardly any space to keep the luggage or move around the ac unit inside the room was so noisy and we lost our nights sleep when we informed about the problem they showed us another room which was worse though the staff were trying to accommodate and help the front office manager was an arrogant lady and refused to provide any solution she was ready to check us out on day when i said we were seriously exploring to move to other hotel as we did not have much time a child travelling with us and had luggage too we could not check out would never book in this place again
