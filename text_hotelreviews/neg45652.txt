we stayed in different radisson blu hotels in past few years and this was the hands down definitely the worst experience ever for the record we were in the room which is in the never part of the hotel but it rather felt like it s part of the hotel yes this wouldn t got more than stars in the rest of the europe or maybe stars where the standards are stretched but it s far from by any standards here are the most irritating problems we experienced double bed was only wide which made whole sleeping experience for two of us quite unpleasant in addition to bed to help us sleep better there was a irritating high pitch twirling noise from the bathroom whole time sounds like a broken ventilation fan than never turns off not that much of a problem unless it s a middle of a night and you want to sleep lastly shower was a w f u l it was sprinkling water everywhere but where it should if fact it was leaking on the side where the shower head is connected so there was a little to none pressure in the shower head itself add in mix that shower head is non removable fixed to the front wall there was quite a success to get any of the water actually on yourself as all of it was leaking on the side and down the wall tiles to make things worst it seems like they re aware of the problem as it looks that someone tried to fix the problem by putting a loose rubber sleeve around the connection which helps absolutely nothing
