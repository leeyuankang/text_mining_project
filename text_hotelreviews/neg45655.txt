the bathroom was poorly designed no room to put my stuff close to the sink just a very narrow ledge and only a ceiling shower head which could not be adjusted i managed to find the hairdryer not in the bathroom but glued in a drawer with such a short cable that i could not reach the mirror with it my room was next to the ice dispenser so it was noisy even late at night also very soft bed my back hurt the next day
