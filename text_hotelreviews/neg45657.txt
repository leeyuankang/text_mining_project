this is the second time i have booked a room with children and the hotel was unaware of it this meant that the family room wasn t ready and a bed had to be made up when we arrived at the staff told us this often happens with a booking com reservation which doesn t recognise children and this is my experience also i ve made several bookings for two upcoming trips if this follows true i won t use your service again
