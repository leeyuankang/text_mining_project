bedroom was very noisey on first floor traffic noise we ate in the restaurant for breakfast staff didn t seem very helpful both days tables were not set up properly missing teaspoons and cups and we booked there for dinner on our second night food was great but we did not stay for the full evening as there was a large table and the service became poor non existent so we left would have liked to try dessert but struggled to get attention paid the service charge but would have been nice to receive some i am sure the table of made it more rewarding for them and they moved another couple from there table during there dinner to set up the big table very poor radisson blu
