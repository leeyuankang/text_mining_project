i have stayed here before and really enjoyed it not this time the room i got was tiny and at the front of the building for the price it certainly wasnt value for money the air con was too loud to have on and to have the windows open for air was also too loud but a necessity never stay at the front of this hotel the road outside is constantly noisy with ambulances at the hospital opposite or trucks and buses all during the night also their pillows were too big and firm and left me with a stiff neck the day staff are lovely but when i checked out at am the night staff were busy chatting about their breakfast deliveries barely raised an eye to me and certainly weren t remotely as professional as the day shift
