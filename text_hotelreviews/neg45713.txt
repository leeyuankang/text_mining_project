my room booking took a long while to come through to the hotel system and i was made to wait close to half an hour to be given a key despite showing the reception desk a booking confirmation it simply took too long then unfortunately for the price of my room the room was very very small quite unlike the picture i had seen on the booking com website the chopped fruit left in my room was a nice touch but was without a cover and the bathroom was unclean all in all i would be reluctant to stay again at such an extortionate price
