we had a junior suit good room and front desk service also the welcome set in the room was sweet only one thing there was no hair comb in the bath cocktail was good though the environment for the bar is just normal please think how to deal with the strong smell of loster because it makes the whole ground floor smelly the breakfast was horrible especially the unfresh strawberry and melon worse not even compared to intercontinental it is like holiday inn bad both the service quality and attitude of the staff can you accept someone using vacuum cleaner when you are still haven t your breakfast not only one table but all around no spoon for the coffee tea yogurt we need to bring back extra breakfast sets for extras space o our table no one comes to serve neither when we were guided nor during the entire breakfast so we had to diy in this star hotel
