i am extremely unhappy about my stay at ramada apollo amsterdam my clothes were taken from my room by the housekeepers and put through the laundry service on the first night i was charged for this even though i did not want my laundry to be taken and cleaned also i asked for fresh toilet paper because housekeeping didn t bother to show up for the first two days and the housekeepers didn t deliver it i also asked for fresh towels and extra milk twice once it didn t come and the second time i was assured the receptionist will bring it up personally but i was ignored i had to come to reception to get the requested items to top things off i was charged on my card despite it being taken off the system on my check in also i lost my watch charger in my room and despite numerous attempts to get through to the hotel i didn t get a reply from them
