the sink was clogged the whole syphon came loose while washing hands that can happen but the repair eventually was not quite that simple while i was gone they repaired when i came back i found a filthy bathroom floor the next day i thought the floor would be cleaned but when i came back my room was not cleaned at all part of it was me because i had the do not disturb sign on the door but in the afternoon i took it off the room should have been cleaned then most people at the front desk are just doing their job on check out the hostess moved to another computer we followed her but then she went back to the one where we had been waiting for so long other people were standing there now too and when we approached the desk so she could finally help us she looked at the other people and she seemed to be irritated that we were standing there now she could have told us just a moment i ll help you soon or wait for me i ll be back shortly and when i told the hostess at check out the story about the syphon she just shrugged did not ask any questions and let me go breakfast is ok nothing special at all cold eggs scrambled eggs were tasteless luckily there were some vegetables the servers were nice but nothing exceptional the hostess was actually unfriendly on our last morning i think because we arrived minutes before the breakfast restaurant closes price is too high for a hotel like this
