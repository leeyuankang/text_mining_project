the rooftop bar was a large part of booking this hotel we asked on arrival for opening times and went about our day however later when asked to go to rooftop bar was informed that it was closed for a private function this was very disappointing especially as we had asked on arrival the floor bar was good but did prevent us fully enjoying the views there should be an information section or advise when booking as we spoke to others staying there who had also selected the hotel for this reason
