beds were very uncomfortable and cheap looking very thin soft mattress that kept sliding off the base i woke up with back pain every morning the food in floor was poor very poor selection and overpriced i only saw people order the burger the maids woke us up most mornings at even when we had a sign on the door one morning they woke us up just to tell us we had walked in some dust from the park outside this place is not worth the money we paid i wouldn t stay here again
