from check in i was angry the man that checked us in never informed me that they were taking euro room deposit from my bank account i would have liked to pay him in cash for that i then questioned him and he apologised for not informing me and told me would receive it back on checkout it took days to come through he then told me it s better to buy our tram tickets from the shop in the hotel rather then on the tram as they would be cheaper he lied we paid for nights pulse euro city tax change that s not including breakfast or anything and they took off me i m still waiting for it to come back into my account i didn t think it was worth that money anyway i wouldn t recommend this hotel for young people the roof top bar closes at o clock there s no entertainment you can t bring your drinks into the smoking area the prices are ridiculous the food menu is bad other then that it s very comfortable and our room was fabulous staff could have been more helpful about things like where to eat etc i found the food was all unhealthy and way overpriced
