first day was a disaster we arrived early so we know that we are not able to check in given a pass key for the storage room but door cannot be opened had to go up to reception to ask for help we returned at to check in only to be told that we are not registered from the very start i was the one to speak to the front desk as booking was in my name i told her that i have paid the room in full had given the front desk desk in the morning the form duly completed by me so with all these how can i they not find the registration after minutes they found the completed form but the registration was in my husband s name she looked at me with accusing eyes meaning you should know that the room was not in your name how on earth can this happened is beyond me everything was in my name even the credit card used was in my name she did not even see my husband who was busy putting the luggage in the storage room two floors down so i asked if i can check in now and she replied that she will have to check if the room is ready but it is nearly by now and checkin is supposed to be at and they already know way before hand that someone will be checking in housekeeping left much to be desired our room was not cleaned for two days we came back in the evening and called front desk and they said they will send someone to clean immediately we declined the offer as we were tired and want to take a shower and told them to ensure that the room gets cleaned the next day it was but the following day it was not cleaned again my husband went to look for the housekeeping person the next morning to get the room cleaned the room for the rest of our stay was eventually cleaned
