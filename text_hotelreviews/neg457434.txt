the restaurant was closed in the weekend because they are understaffed the king size bed felt very small but more importantly was very uncomfortable and the room in general was much smaller than anticipated and dirty in several areas the room was also very dusty so i would not recommend this to anyone with an allergy and on top of that the windows in the room could not be opened the breakfast area and skylounge offered limited seating and were often overcrowded several breakfast items sausages eggs were very overcooked every day and in the skylounge they would often be out of certain drinks roomservice is only limited to breakfast and missing toiletries
