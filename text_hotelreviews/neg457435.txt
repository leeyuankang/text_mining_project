bathroom flooded due to blocked drainage resulting me drying the bathroom for my partner i really didn t want the hotel staff doing that when i was ready to go to sleep bed was really bad the right side was slanted which resulted in a horrible back pain the next morning the welcome letter was addressed to somebody else the previous day we had another room and the breakfast which also had issues the bathroom door was blocked and we needed to yank it open the breakfast room was dirty in the corner of the breakfast room there were some loose panels just laying about the breakfast itself was of the stuff we had bread was dry crackers were not crackling ham was chewy i actually expect more from a four star hotel so i rate the price quality ratio to be really bad we were not compensated for any of these issues after telling the staff however we were offered a coffee thee which i find not satisfying enough for the bad experience we had
