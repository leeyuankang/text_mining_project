there was rubbish left from the previous occupant of the room it was very difficult to get service in the restaurant at lunch time baggage lockers instructions were in dutch only so we could not understand how to use them roof top bar was not open as advertised however we sat up to look at the view in the evening and were chucked out by staff who closed it early with no notice staff in general were very unhelpful and did not volunteer any information
