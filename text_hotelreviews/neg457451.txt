no real sense of customer value from the front desk apparently i was told their main customers are large corporates sending staff and airlines as a business man and also for personal stay i was not offered any form of loyalty discounts after extending numerous times to stay at the hotel this makes you feel undervalued unlike other hotel chains that would try to on board you through loyalty programmes or discounted rates if you continue to re book with them maybe they should think about it
