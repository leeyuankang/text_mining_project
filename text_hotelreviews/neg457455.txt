the service in the restaurant was a little slow we were left with empty plates in front of us for half an hour whilst waiting for the bill and the staff didn t come to ask if we wanted any further drinks they were busy on the first night we went but it was considerably quieter on the second night we visited and the service was the same it wasn t enough to ruin our meal but definitely something that could have been improved upon as many of the staff seemed to notice we were waiting but didn t serve us
