although hotel comfortable they could do with adding extra facilities such as a general shop not just tourist shop pool and possibly another restaurant due to its location once we left in the morning we stayed out all day and we didn t want to head out again after coming back the bar at times struggled to provide enough seating sheets on bed a bit on the lean side we were on floor and the views were brilliant but room tight for adults however we were probably on a budget room so i suppose cannot complain too much would i go back for the staff and views yes for the choice of food in restaurant no very limited for location well i m not sure it was pleasantly quiet but a bit out of the centre
