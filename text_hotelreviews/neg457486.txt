only small things can be faulted the room did feel slightly cold at times however this just had to be adjusted on the aircon but with so many windows the room was heated with the sun also the bed was very large but the duvet did not cover the whole bed when leaving the hotel we left our luggage there as our flight was later they have a system where you store your luggage in lockers however all instructions where in dutch which made it time consuming using google translate shame as all staff were fluent in english which made check in out and questions easy
