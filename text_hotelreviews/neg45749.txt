disorganised re my booking which i extended by an extra night and told them about it months in advance seems it wasn t enough i had to check out of my room and check back in with other cards all quite ridiculous i booked a single room for nights nothing like the pics on the website the first room was pokey just horrible and for the first time in years of travelling i asked for it to be changed plugs didn t work dark and dingy poor lighting bad wifi noisy and the toilet didn t work remote for tv too wasn t working music one does not need loud music in a lift and neither does one need loud awful singing and other music at breakfast it was so loud that i couldn t read the newspaper apparently many people complain and yet the management say it s the hotel policy hmmm i received a message on sunday morning to come early for breakfast as it s busy that seems weird too i also received messages from booking com about leaving in the middle of my stay maybe the computer website managers need to do a refresh some of the reception staff need more crm training always smile and say sorry to the customer and you won t go wrong
