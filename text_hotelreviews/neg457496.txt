rooms are very small and we had been given a free upgrade i dread to think how small the standard double is we had originally booked you can t turn the heating up in your room past a certain temperature and it got quite cold one of the nights also the bus from the airport to the hotel only has eight seats so don t expect to get the first bus if staying at a busy time they come evey min so you may have to wait quite a while
