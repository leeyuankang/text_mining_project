i have stayed in the hotel before on my previous stay as well there was a good level of mismanagement anyway i will talk about this stay only the shuttle system is very disorganised on the way in way back to airport is okay there is no way for people to queue up i missed my first shuttle the second one arrived after minutes but that one got full and i wasn t allowed to board the driver took luggage from everyone in one large group some of whom joined the queue after me my wife who actually had no luggage to check in was sitting in the bus and she had to get off after having boarded the bus it was not the driver s fault it is just that the hotel management has not come up with a system whereby passengers arriving could book a seat on the shuttle this should be simple enough to do in i requested an early check in to be fair the hotel did offer me a different room for early check in but i didn t avail it as i wanted the room i booked i locked my luggage and went out to kill some time so the hotel would prepare my room by the hotel management were aware that i had arrived i locked my luggage went through my id and booking details etc by they knew i was going out to kill time and will return by when i returned at i realised my room wasn t ready and they offered me a different room we had gone through this earlier that i didn t want a different room just the room i paid for ultimately i had to wait another minutes or so to get a check in to my room in the end i was extremely tired and a good part of my time planned for entertainment was spent dealing with a mismanaged hotel
