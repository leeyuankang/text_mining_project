taxi cost each way to airport check in was over complicated and it wouldn t take my debit card and i had to walk minutes at midnight in freezing weather to an atm after which i was informed i also needed a deposit on the room thankfully they just took the last i had as the deposit the airport shuttle was all booked and check out took ages because of people skipping ques and staff working in pairs not individually
