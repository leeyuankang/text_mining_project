shuttle service from the airport is unreliable and only has seats so you may not get on we waited mins the hotel is quite remote you have to use tram to centre no bars or restaurants nearby the young manager in the bar is very rude witnessed him arguing with a couple visting the hotel and he was completely unprofessional pointing at them including the female and arguing and then fetched security and had them removed i couldnt see what they did to deserve that but they certainly werent being argumentative the couple were much older than this young lad who was pranching round like he owned the bar and revelling in relaying to all the bar staff what he was arguing about not what you want when youre enjoying a drink and very disrespectful to his elders and an unprofessional way to handle customers our shower dripped fast constantly and wasnt fixed despite a request we stayed nights and it was annoying
