i had booked a queen sized room and paid for a night stay i didnt mind the price of almost a night if it was a queen sized room however it wasn t although the decor mirrors bed bathroom was modern the room was not spacious at all and the only room was around the edges of the bed it had a fantastic view of amsterdam but for the price i would have liked something bigger than a basic premier inn we also were not allowed to check in until pm even though we arrived at a long time to wait after travelling from this was stated however and i would not have minded but on the day off check out that day the same cleaning staff knocked on our door times the first time was at hours before check out there was no rush from the staff to check us in however we were very rushed to check out we explained the young lady we would not be leaving until as we didn t need to be at the airport until so didn t see the point after all we had paid an expensive price however she continued to return and disturb us i was also charged deposit on checking in which i wasn t aware of and had to use half of my spending money to do so and then go into savings whilst there i checked the terms and conditions of the property and found that it was explained so did not complain however during the trip this money cleared from my bank and after checking out took days to be put back into it a lot more money spent on a very average property after all this i still had an amazing time on my trip and didn t let the hotel bother me until afterwards when i called to explain i hadn t been paid back and was spoken to very rudely and actually hung up on which left me feeling very sour about the hotel and the staff
