we paid extra for a room with a view and they gave us a room with a view of a main road and flats when the picture on the website was of the park we requested to change room and they gave us the same room just higher up therefore wrong again they apologised by giving us free breakfast each and the shuttle back to the airport free i feel they could have just charged us for a normal room with no view as this is what we got also we got there early so understood we couldn t check in but our room was literally ready just intime and we were sat there for a few hours whilst everyone else was able to get their room straight away so we waited hours for a room which was the wrong one wasn t a good start
