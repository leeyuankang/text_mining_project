only one thing was on wednesday march it was my birthday and we had decided to come back to the hotel early and get ready for a night in the bar bistro we arrived and were seated straight away and got a drink but then we tried to order food and another drink for mins but no one even looked at us as there was an argument with one of the waiters and the chef for taking a customer order wrong and having to take it back twice so we felt an atmosphere and were a bit put off so we paid the bill and left the hotel in the rain to go to a local restaurant as by this time we were really hungry it s not put us off the hotel at all just disappointing as i was looking forward to it being a birthday treat
