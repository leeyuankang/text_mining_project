our queen double standard room was small not much space to move around i expected a bit bigger better room luckily we only had a hand luggage otherwise we would ve really struggled i also was not aware of the deposit you have to pay at the desk which automatically sets people back on money then the smoking most people who visit amsterdam come for the same reason like myself i was located on the floor which was absolutely fine i requested a high floor for a view however i hated the fact that i had to go down floors every time i wanted to smoke i had to get dressed at whenever i wanted a fag i had to stand outside in the rain to smoke i think balconies would be a great option
