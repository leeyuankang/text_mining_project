only negative thing was the second night we d been out all day to be greeted in our room with a sewage smell from the bathroom not pleasant however we phoned reception and the woman apologised a manager came up not to long after and moved us rooms and offered us drinks and complimentary shuttle bus back to airport usually per person this still hasn t put me off staying here again and would defiantly recommend to friends thank you for a lovely stay
