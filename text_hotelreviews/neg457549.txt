our shower we arrived at the hotel around and my partner noticed a slight wet patch on the bathroom floor next to the shower we both thought nothing of it we then went out for the day came back to get ready to go out again in the evening whilst getting ready my partner noticed that the shower was not draining very well but we thought nothing of it as showers and drains can be slightly temperamental and the rest of the room was so perfect we were not in a pedantic mood the following morning my partner and i both had showers and went out for the day again when we returned the floor was soaking wet and my partner used already wet towels to soak up the excess water then i went and informed reception who were extremely helpful and apologetic and offered us a room upgrade which we did not accept as we saw the issue as only a minor inconvenience and were only informing them so it did not effect our deposit the receptionist then came up with new towels and dried the floor herself she then got maintenance to look at it the following day whilst we were out the shower did still leak slightly the following day but we both understand that it is not a problem that can be fixed quickly and especially not whilst the room in occupied
