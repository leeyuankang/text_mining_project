the table in the room was not wiped on any of the days that we were there the coffee stains on the table were there and i had to clean the room after it was cleaned the soap bottle on the wall fell by itself on the first day we were there it was not fixed till we left the shampoo bottles were never changed in the bathroom either it was pretty pricey for a night stay and we were expecting a little more cleanliness on the behalf of the hotel at least shampoo
