we booked executive room so the bigger one in december the room was very cold the first night was almost too cold to sleep only by the second night the temperature got comfortable after keeping the a c on all day and all night room felt old and a bit dirty the mattress was ok but the quilt wasn t big enough for the bed there was no headboard but there were some pointy edges where i scratched my head a few times while sleeping also no nightstands either the bathroom was spacious but a bit badly designed you need to close the toilet cover to get the water flushing button the shower didn t have a door there was a step at the door while entering the bathroom there wasn t any toothpaste dental kit available we had to ask for it at the reception there was a kettle and some instant coffee and sugar but there weren t any teaspoons available we had a fridge in the room but it was empty so no minibar
