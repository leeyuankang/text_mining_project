i was rather disappointed with the ramada after having read the description and positive reviews firstly the room was not clean floor not vacuumed someone had spilled liquids on the wall which was not removed shower was open which meant the bathroom floor flooded toiletpaper holder was loose the restaurant has a nice view however i was not allowed to sit by the window being alone i was directed to a single s table away from the window but everything would be made up by the sauna or so i thought the infrared sauna gets hardly lukewarm not nearly hot enough to take a sauna very disappointing
