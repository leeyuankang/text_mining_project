room design and service are such a disaster there is no any cabinet for clothes only same shelfs air conditioner works terrible and very very slow heating up and max temperature is there is no minibar in rooms there is no shower curtain in toilet because of this when you take shower all toilet getting wet there is no any disposal slippery tooth brush or sewing kit only one type shampoo and towel when room service come daily they only change towels not bed sheets when you sleep if someone go to toilet toilet lights directly shining to you your eyes and last thing when you order a water for euro only from room service you have to pay extra euros
