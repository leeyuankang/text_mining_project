rooms are not as big as most star hotels we were upgraded for free from a standard to a deluxe room and still the size was regular small not all bedrooms have a king queen size bed so be careful since sharing bed together is definitely not the same breakfast is too expensive per person which is a lot and because of that we never had breakfast in the hotel lunch dinner is simple but good and the prices are reasonable
