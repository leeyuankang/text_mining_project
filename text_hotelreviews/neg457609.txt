finish in the bathroom was a little poor shower tray leaked a little and fan was constantly running which was luckily not to bad when the door to the bathroom was closed also the soap dispenser in the shower was stuck the wall with what i m pretty sure was just silicone was about ready to fall off each time i used it when i first arrived i had to ask the staff to come and fix the tv which wasn t working properly and open the safe to enable me to use it staff were friendly and very helpful and came to get the problem sorted straight away but just a few little details would be nice not to have to sort out
