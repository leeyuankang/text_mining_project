location very out of the way team stops so if you want to go out taxi is home there was meant to be a bus from airport to hotel and this never arrived after digging the hotel times people were not nice at all and it was crazy expensive we rang reception a couple of times and were told to walk down to reception as nobody could drop anything up to room better off staying in a hostel
