bar on floor closed on friday night for private party we were sent to lobby where they only had plastic glasses for wine which only came in small bottles and no glasses at all for beer us oldies do like glasses and a normal bottle of wine between staff in bar on saturday night most unhelpful and service very slow after a long day sightseeing it would have been nice to relax in a pleasant bar with staff as good as on reception
