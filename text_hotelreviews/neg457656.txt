the hotel shuttle is driving guests from the airport to the hotel every minutes it cannot accomodate every guest so people have to wait for the next shuttle this hotel has to arrange more frequent pick ups every minutes or use a bigger vehicle amsterdam has a busy airport when my husband and i entered the shuttle the driver asked us to leave the van cause there were people who should be on the bus who he could not accomodate on his last trip from the airport to the hotel if i would have known i would not have waited for this bus and taken a taxi which we did anyway the evening before we arrived i inquired about the shuttle via phone call to the ramada front desk someone said not to use the public transport it would take too much time and rather take the hotel shuttle the staff could make people aware on the phone that the bus might run out of space it was just a waste of time and experiencing a rude treatment from the driver and we paid a taxi at the end we should have done before we explained the situation to a lady at the reception of the hotel she listened to us and made sure we were taken care of which was nice overall i have been to the apollo ramada before and will again and i would suggest the hotel
