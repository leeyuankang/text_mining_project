the location is not very convenient in amsterdam there a lot of the other hotels closer to the city center this hotel is too business but with lack of the needed service restaurant is expensive with poor taste of dishes fitness area is very small sauna is not very comfortable and not enough hot even conference facilities could be better i would not recommend this hotel taking into account alternatives in amsterdam
