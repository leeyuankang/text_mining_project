the shuttle bus issue we had although a great service of free shuttle from airport being able to reserve a slot on production of your passport would be something you should think about as people that just exited the airport jumped on bus while we were putting our bags on as we were already first there waiting and then we had to remove our bags and shared a taxi with other people rather than wait another mins for the shuttle to return
