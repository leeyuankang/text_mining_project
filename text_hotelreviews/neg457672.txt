one member of staff was rude when we came in to check in so we moved to another person and the transport from airport to hotel the guy was also rude told us to get of the bus because we hadn t asked if we could go on but we just followed everyone else and we was there before some of the other people so had to mke our own way to the hotel it should be properly organised rather than just deciding who goes and who doesn t it should be who as be waiting the longest not who gets on first
