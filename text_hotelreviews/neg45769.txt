we stayed at this hotel a few years ago and the room we were allocated was excellent hence why i chose this hotel again this time the room was not as nice ie at back of hotel awful view of air con units on roof top also the bathroom had no separate shower there was no tea coffee making facilities the furnishings in the room looked a little tired no spa facilities not value for money
