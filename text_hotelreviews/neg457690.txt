as i booked a queen size bed room a few months back and on arrival i received a double room but it was with two single beds pushed together i didn t mind but the fact that i paid for a big room and didn t get it i did try and find out why this was we got upgraded to the top floor which i had already requested from the start yet the beds were still two singles as me and my partner this was our first holiday away together i paid enough for the hotel to not give me the room i wanted very disappointed
