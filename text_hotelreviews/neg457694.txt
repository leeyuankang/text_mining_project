staff were a little clueless took euro out of my card instead of for a safety deposit for the room i had no money left as they took it on the day of my stay and i had days left with literally no money they did nothing to help me with their own mistake the room wasn t ready when we arrived which wasn t bad but we were given a room on the floor instead of the floor that i paid for room was gorgeous but very small for the price that i paid also when we went onto the floor bar for food and drinks we were told to go change our clothes as we didn t meet dress code standards which was extremely rude as we were dressed very nice and neatly by the time we went back to the room and got changed and went back up to the bar we were told oh you were gone for so long that we haven t a table for you anymore so after telling us to go change they gave away our table then told us that we were gone too long in the end we got a table so far at the back that we didn t get served for mins when i finally asked for some service it was again another mins i asked to be moved to somewhere where we would actually be seen we decided not to go to floor bar again
