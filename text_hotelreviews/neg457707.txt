location was a lot further time wise from the centre of amsterdam than it appears in distance on a map cleaning staff don t seem to understand the do not disturb sign every single day they would knock on the door with the sign on waking me up i was out all night for ade and sleeping all day so as the sign suggested i didn t want to be disturbed also no mini bar in the room which seemed odd
