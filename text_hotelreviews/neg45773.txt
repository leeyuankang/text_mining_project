not much difference in size between standard and superiour rooms except room rate my room was facing noisy tottenham court road which gave me a hard first night even when windows were shut buffet breakfast tasted good but was a bit monotonous e g one sort of cheese in relation to the room rates disturbing continuous exposure to loud music during breakfast even louder at the bar in the evening
