we were not informed in advance that the bar and restaurant were closed for one night and therefore there was no dinner available then we had to order from an italian restaurant indicated by the concierge food not so good for the price charged room smaller than we expected would be better if there was a small refrigerator in the room would love to have decaf tea in the room only regular tea was available
