the seating in the bar and breakfast area is uncomfortable we were not allowed to have our evening meal in the restaurant seating area as we were eating from the bar menu the high bar like seats are ok for having a drink but not for eating breakfast or dinner didn t like the big space behind the bed we couldn t prop up pillows to read as they fell through the gap we stayed for three nights but would not be able to hang clothes if we stayed for a longer period not enough hanging space
