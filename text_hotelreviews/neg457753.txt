perhaps it is a cultural difference in how things are done but clarity on shuttle airport pick up and return procedure at the time of booking with booking com would have been helpful ended up corresponding directly with the hotel to get all my questions answered why not save everyone time and provide that information beforehand free shuttle pick up every minutes from to at the last covered stand portion for shuttles outside and to the right of terminals look for ramada apollo listing on an overhead sign crowded with other hotel names but be forewarned there is also another ramada apollo shuttle which goes to wynham only look for the printed sign in the side window not just the red painted sign on the silver color passenger van outside of those shuttle hours you ll need to take a cab there is a charge for the return trip and it needs to be reserved the day before the charge per person is added to your hotel bill don t misplace the business card receipt which has your shuttle departure time and room number it s your ticket for the next day drop off is at the same place as pick up arrival level our driver fetched and loaded a luggage cart for us that was unexpected and appreciated service well deserving of a significant tip you ll need to take the cart escalator or lift elevstor up one floor to the departure level this may be a minor point to some but not others we simply put up with it not a deal breaker for us facilities at the ramada apollo hotel were great except for the design of the shower stall not too functional plenty of towels are available just ask to deal with the splash through the entry way an open half of the stall no shower curtain possible in the design without destroying the aesthetic appeal not a very green approach
