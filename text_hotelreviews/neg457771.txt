shuttle is a joke only eight seats so you have to wait minutes most of the hotells are reachable easy by train or airport buses it was not a welcoming start rude staff then we reserve a full bed and it was a twin bed they change it but the worse was the mattress and the pillow it seems you are in a sleeping bag then no toiletries famous roof was close the four nights due to private event we give up about complaining and enjoyed our trip the city was wonderful
