food at the rooftop terrace of the hotel is well overpriced but that seems to be the case in all of amsterdam bus transfer to the city was convenient however driver was extremely rude he refused to let us on the bus at first as we didn t have tickets however we had paid at reception and booked the transfer the day before reception failed to give us tickets which was rectified quickly however no need to be rude to guests if its the hotels fault driver left us standing there and didn t offer help
