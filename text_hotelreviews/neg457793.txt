breakfast was average some of the dishes still had some chocolate sauce on when i went to get a clean plate some of the spoons seemed to be sticky too rooms were small and plain if this was a deluxe i would not like to have seen a standard beds not comfortable breakfast was very average price of the room was way too expensive for what we received i have stayed in a lot of hotels around the world at lower prices with much bigger and better rooms lobby could do with a referb wifi was also terrible check in time was supposed to be which in my opinion is too late but our room was not ready until after not a great start
