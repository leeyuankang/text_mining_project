food was enjoyable in the restaurant but felt could have been better for the price charged our room was a little late being prepared for check in when we were switched to another room and brought our bags to it someone else was already in there so we had to bring our luggage back down to reception and get another room this was only a minor issue and didn t cause a great deal of hastle overall very happy with our stay
