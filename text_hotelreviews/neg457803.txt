lady on the floor which lead to the roof top was very rude the tone she had spoken to me in everytime i went up was horrendous she would always stop me from going up and question me in a rude manner and i don t know if it was racially connected or whatever ruined my experience as i paid to use all facilities in the hotel as i was staying ther for nights so i shouldn t be stopped or questioned or hindered from access to anything
