i had stated it was my boyfriends birthday and it didn t get acknowledged although i had read that on others birthdays balloons had been put in rooms and i had also asked for an early room as our flight landed at and was told room wouldn t be ready until on arrival so was a bit disappointed as can only be expected i also thought the breakfasts were very expensive
