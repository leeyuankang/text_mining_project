we were checked in in a downgrade room and not the type of room we reserved the light switches were dirty and the bathroom was smelling like stagnant urine as it was not cleaned for weeks we had to stay the night since we werd extremly tired next day moved to a better room which firs our reservation but we were not able to sleep because of the ventillator in the bathroom too loud and never stops even if you switch off the bathroom lights all in all bad experience
