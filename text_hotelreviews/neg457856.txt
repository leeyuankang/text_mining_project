i liked everything about this hotel except one thing it was very cold in the room and the ac didn t go above degrees at night i told them from the first day that there is a problem with the ac and they kept telling me that they would fix it the next day but they didn t finally after three nights of freezing in the room a woman from the reception offered to bring a portable heater in the room and it was fine so if you are freezing at night ask for a heater
