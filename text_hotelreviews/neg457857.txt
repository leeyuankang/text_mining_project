the shower tray was too flat so both myself and friend flooded the bathroom both nights whilst having a shower the tv was also temperamental and wouldn t work majority of the time for whatever reason wasn t clear on how to use the air con so the room was very cool even when attempting to turn it up i also didn t like the unexpected fee i received for using my debit card to pay when i got home without warning
