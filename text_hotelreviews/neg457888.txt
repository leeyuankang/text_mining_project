while checking in we found the staff member to be inexperienced and that the reservation staff had failed to take into account a previous reservation that had been cancelled and as a result insisted that we had to pay for two rooms luckily after calling booking com they called the hotel and advised them that the initial reservation had been cancelled months ago in addition the bedding was below standard and the double bed consisted of two single beds pushed together with single mattresses that tended to slide off the bed each sideways each night the choices for food each evening consisted of either bar food snacks or an overpriced degustation restaurant overall a very unsatisfying and disappointing experience
