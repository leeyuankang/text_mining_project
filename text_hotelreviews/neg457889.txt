personally i would have preferred fewer mirrors and more convenient storage space in room very odd wardrobe behind bed was too small and too dark to see properly and too high for me to reach easily i am foot tall also a proper bedside table would have been nice beside the bed not behind it so you had to twist round another door to the shower would have stopped the bathroom flooding when my daughter washed her hair and a plug in the washbasin would have made it easier for me to put my contact lenses in without worrying about washing down the sink
