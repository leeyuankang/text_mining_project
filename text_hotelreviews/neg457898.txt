never got a reply if shuttle bus will be available to pick us from airport they only changed our towels once in nights the receptionist who booked our shuttle back didn t actually booked we were told by other staff in the day we left luckily places were still available if there is a corporate event restaurant is not available for guests shame the very disappointing fact was that they didn t release our security deposit until we called in the hotel working days later when we were told the person who checked us out never released the deposit so hours more to wait overall nothing extraordinary just pay to sleep
