i booked a single room over one month ago as a special deal on this booking site but when i arrived at the hotel the room i got was very small and dark when you looked out the window you looked at a big wall and felt very claustophobic i complained twice the second room was on the second floor very small too and smelled very much kitchen as the ventilation of the restaurant below was directly outside my room i finally changed to a double room for which i had to pay gbp per night extra that room was bigger but also very dark with only one window it seems that when you book via booking com the hotels give you the poorer rooms all rooms that i have seen during that stay are not worth the money paid of a radisson hotel with stars i would have expected better rooms
