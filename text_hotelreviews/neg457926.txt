although the room has a modern design wear is evident the cleaning was not through when i first arrived at the room for instance there was red stuff on the bathtub floor and water stains on the shower knobs the walls were dented with black lines and there was a huge stain on the sofa cushion i thought these imperfections would be corrected the second day s room cleaning but during the hours i m not in the room there was no housekeeping service
