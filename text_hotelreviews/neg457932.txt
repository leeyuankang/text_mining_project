a little bit more luggage space in the room and a marginally bigger bathroom would have been the icing on the cake but overall very happy with overall value for money of this hotel as a base for sight seeing a shuttle bus timetable on the hotel website would have been enlightening and information telling us that there is a timetable at the airport bus stop would also have allowed us to manage our time a bit better at the airport on arrival
