staff were not cooperative during my booking i asked for a top floor room with city view and when i arrived the reception employee gave us a room in lower floor and promised to move us the next day which never happened my girlfriend called the reception asking for a vase for flowers and no one came until i called again and finally they gave us an ice bucket i asked for sugar for coffee and as usual no one came
