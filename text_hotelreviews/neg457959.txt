being woken at by staff knocking on our door to give us a toilet roll woke the next morning to no shower gel as the container hadn t been filled unlike our friends we had no iron or ironing board in our room only sachets of coffee and container s of cream for the morning no milk for a cup of tea the safe was locked on arrival and we waited mins for someone to unlock it but they never came so had to take our personal belongings out with us all very small things but very annoying
