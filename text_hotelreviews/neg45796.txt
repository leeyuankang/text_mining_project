i asked for extra milk for tea in the room had to ask twice then received out of date tubes of milk which made me feel ill until i realised they were out of date also i had to go and buy my own decaffinated tea across the road as you do not provide it i have never been to a major hotel that didn t offer decaf tea there was a lethal step paces into the room which inevitably i fell down as the first thing that takes your attention in the room are the floor to ceiling windows directly looking onto warren st station so if you want privacy you need to keep the blinds closed wifi slow wouldn t stay there again
