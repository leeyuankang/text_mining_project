the breakfast wasn t great maybe just go out into town early and have your own not worth the money we were given single beds instead of the large king size as stated in the booking the shuttle service is free from the airport but euros on the way back which we didn t mind paying but as we wasn t told that you had to book them back to the airport they were then fully booked so we had to pay euros big difference
