arrived late and told there was no food by person seating people was advised at bar that food was available a particular temporary bar staff personnel was very rude and condescending and with little or no knowledge of the bar i refused to be served by her and was taken care of by a young lady glasses with dark hair tied up who i recognised from last visit she was excellent as were most of the staff it s not possible to have staff untrained and with attitude when dealing with the public on the strength of this experience i will look to avoid this hotel on my next visit to the city
