the first day the kettle is rusty the next day they changed the kettle but the heating plate is broken am in the morning someone knocking at the door asking for housekeeping should the housing keeping be in the afternoon for guests who are not going to check out that day plus the door key is not functioning so well making me come back to the reception times and they are still blaming me for keeping the door keys next to my phone if that is true there should be at least one key working but for me both keys are not working if the door keys are not working after the guests refresh it twice you should think about your own problem it is not appropriate to blame the guests about keeping their keys wrong
