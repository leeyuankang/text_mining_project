we ve booked a few weeks in advance an executive king room and for the first night we ve paid euros for it when we arrived at the hotel they tried to fool us by giving us a normal room when i ve told them that we ve booked an executive room they were kind of rode and i had to discuss to the manager he told me that we overbooked the hotel and there is nothing they can do for us he offered us free breakfast for the entire stay the room wasn t cleaned up for days during one afternoon i wanted to order something to eat in the room and when i ve called the reception to ask for a menu they told me that i have to go upstairs to get it myself i was in the restaurant and asked for a menu but they told me that i can t take it in the room and that i have to pay in advance if i want to order something
