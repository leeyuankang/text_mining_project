at the check in we were offered a breakfast for per person which we agreed for one day out of days stay after check out i found an extra debit in the invoice for the second breakfast instead of one only having called the reception this was corrected and i was promised the refund for this mistake but the price for the first breakfast went up from to per person the hotel contact explained that there was some sort of special offer for the breakfast which can t be used for one day only this was never announced to us and the reception accepted our one day breakfast request in the first place extra breakfast cost is not significant especially having paid for nights stay but the situation is disappointing and extra hassle to get the refund for a mistake in the invoice is not what you would want after a trip do check your invoice when leaving the hotel
