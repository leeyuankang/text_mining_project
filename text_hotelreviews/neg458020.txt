we were extremely disappointed with the floor bar restaurant not in terms of the quality of food and drink but because we were turned away on occasions the bar was quite busy and we were told that we couldn t just go in and have drinks at the bar even after informing the rather abrupt member of staff that we were hotel guests she told us that it didn t matter we still couldn t get in i specifically booked this hotel because of the roof terrace and floor facilities i wanted to enjoy the fabulous views over amsterdam and be able to smoke on the floor terrace i m afraid what was otherwise a lovely experience at ramada apollo was very much spoiled by our experiences on the floor i ve never stayed in any hotel before where guests could not use the bar restaurant facilities no matter how busy they were i d be very reluctant to stay again despite all other aspects of the hotel being very good
