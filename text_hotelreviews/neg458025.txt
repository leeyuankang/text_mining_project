the rooms could of had a little more lighting and a headboard so people don t have to sit apart from each other in order for them to lean against something secondly i was asked to pay deposit which i was told i was receive back when i checkout the staff member didn t make it clear that there would be a city tax which i understand was on the terms and conditions but people don t usually read them therefore i think the staff members should give customers a little reminder about that to avoid any confusion also i borrowed an adaptor and the lady that gave me it again didn t tell me there would be a charge to borrow it she handed me it and asked for my room number and that was it i was then told when getting the deposit back that there was a charge which i was not happy with and i wasn t going to pay it as i wasn t aware again staff should be clear about any payments and extra charges that will be given to their customers however in response to this a gentleman behind the reception gave me a complimentary shuttle ride to the airport which i was grateful for
