very unhappy experience from the staff when i have made the booking i have requested if it is possible to upgrade to a room with bath tub the reply from the hotel was it is possible to arrange but cannot guarantee we have arrived early the check in day around informed by the receptionist that we have been upgraded for free to an executive room which is still under cleaning so we would have to wait till later for the check in we went out for a few hours and got back to check in by the time around with a different shift of receptionist he had arranged us a standard room instead so we explained the situation to him about his colleague had said to us earlier about the upgrade his attitude was not at all good saying that we will need to pay extra for the executive room and no one had ever arranged to us the upgrade we have even told them the staff s name was robyn robin who had greeted us earlier instead of checking with his colleague he insisted his opinion and ask us to show him prove in writing of course we didn t have it in writing and he looked at us as if we were lying just trying to get some advantage after all we have paid money and time to fly a long way trying to have a nice holiday so we didn t insist and don t want to argue to ruin our mood besides we understand totally that the upgrade was not guaranteed but wouldn t it nice if we were treated in a better attitude and if the upgrade was not existed we just get a standard room earlier than waiting specially for that executive room since there were no shops or restaurant close to the hotel we had checked especially on one of the day before we go out to ask if they still can serve food late
