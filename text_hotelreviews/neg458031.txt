hotel is quite expensive at the bar and food we always eat out so didn t really affect us sauna is quite big and has to be powered on by buttons on the wall was in there around half an hour minutes and didn t really get hot at all not sure if it s because it hadn t been used all day or the type of sauna it is like electric heaters behind a glass panel
