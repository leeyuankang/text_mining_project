didn t like the fact we had to give euros as a safety deposit for the room this was unexpected and we didn t budget it for it the bed we had was comfy but was two single bed put together which split in half wasn t a double bed we asked for extra pillows as we were only provides with and no spares in the cupboard these pillows did not arrive with throughout our stay
