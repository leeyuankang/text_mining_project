it was hard to get my friend through the door on the wheelchair because there was no way to stop the door so i had to hold the door open with one arm and push the wheelchair with the other arm the curtains do not completely black out the lights from the window when the sun is shining the room is extremely illuminated even with all curtains closed as our room was a special room there was a door that connected our room to another i think it s for couples who travel with their children but still want to sleep in a separate room there happened to be people in the other room and we could hear everything that was going on in the room quite loudly
