the overall experience was really nice the only thing that let the stay down was the attitude of the staff the lobby staff downstairs were immaculate with their manners always smiling and welcomed us every time we came back from being away from the hotel however staff up on floor lacked the customer care quality on the second night when we arrived at the top bar for drinks at ish and took seats at the bar we waited for the two bartenders to come over and take our order after nearly minutes neither of them made eye contact but knew we were there and when emma from the restaurant came inside the bar and asked if we d been served she was shocked when we said no the female bartender then said to her we ve taken last orders already although she failed to make myself and my other half aware of this which i found quite rude the following night when we went back are jackets were taken because apparently there is a house rule that jackets are not to be worn in the bar area once we went into the bar about people had their jackets either on or with them however ours had to go downstairs once pulling up the host and the bartender up on this we were told with some rude attitude by the young male bartender that we weren t being singled out and you don t wear jackets in bars anyway just really unprofessional really and this was a let down to the stay
