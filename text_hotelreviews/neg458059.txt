it is a little bit out of town you have to get a tram which takes about mins to get to dam square we went out one night and had to get a taxi back and it cost euros i would suggest getting an uber if you can there was a bit of a mess up with our transfer i called the night before to arrange the transfer and once i arrived to the reception mins before we were meant to leave the bus was apparently full luckily another couple never appeared so we were lucky to get their spots i would suggest getting written confirmation about these types of things which we stupidly did not for a big hotel the bus they use only has seats so get there early to ensure your space especially when you land it was a free for all and we saw groups of people being turned away and they were told it would take hour mins until the next one
