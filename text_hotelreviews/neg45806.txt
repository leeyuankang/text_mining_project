when we ordered dinner to the room they brought burgers and chips up on wooden board with napkin and set of cutlery we asked for a second set but by the time it all arrived mins later we were nearly finished eating also the pillows were far too thick they were way thicker than ordinary pillows which meant that we both awoke with neck pain i suggest putting a fat pillow and a normal pillow in each room so that people can choose the placement of sockets in the room would have been an issue if i hadn t brought a multi plug extension
