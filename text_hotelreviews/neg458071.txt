one little hiccup before our stay i had emailed the hotel asking for directions from eindhoven all directions were clear and easy to follow until we got to amsterdam centraal we knew the stop we needed to get off at but did not know the tram number we spent an hour asking local people police information workers in the station and in the ticket office and not one person could help us eventually we got a taxi and found out at the hotel this got our first day off to a poor start but you certainly made up for it after that
