they need to better look after the rooms basically they are ok but in our room the door only opened if you kicked the bottom from outside or pulled heavily from inside several of the safe numerals did not work but then sometimes did so it was hard to be sure whether to use the safe or not only extra pillow per room plus you had to remove the ironing board to use the wardrobe space etc etc etc not good for the rates paid to be honest finally we had specifically asked for a view over amsterdam centre but got a room at the back
