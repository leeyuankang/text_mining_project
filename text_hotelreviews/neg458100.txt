there wasnt much we didnt like we didnt like the fact we had to pay deposit upfront when we arrived when it stated on our booking we didnt need to pay it there was a male staff member in the floor bar who wasnt very polite my partner asked him did they have magners and he just replied with a no not even sorry we dont have that but we have this he didnt look at us in the eye when he said no he just kept his head down making cocktails apart from these two things we had a fantastic stay and would stay here again
