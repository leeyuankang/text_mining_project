on leaving we removed and folded the bed sheets as usual to assist the room staff only to notice a very large dark red blood stain which while obviously dried was non the less neither hygenic nor welcome however this did seem to go along with the standard for the room dirt under the bed and in the bathroom add in the fact that the only room service offered over the weekend was on sunday evening this is the third time we have stayed here and certainly not or best experience dining and drinking facilities reduced by by turning those same facilities booked and payed for over to a private function without any advance notice and leaving little in the way of choice for food on the night when needed
