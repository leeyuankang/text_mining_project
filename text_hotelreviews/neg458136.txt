room could have been cleaner i was travelling with my son so when i pulled the beds apart to create space the carpet had quite a lot of debris on the bathroom had no toiletries in only bottles of the same cream in the basin and shower no shampoos etc i also had problems gaining access to the room and had to go between the floor and reception times to learn that the door entry system was faulty
