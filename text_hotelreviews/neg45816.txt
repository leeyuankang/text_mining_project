everything at the hotel was fine when you look at it it was clean in general but for that i paid for a double room definitely it was not worth it it was cold the the heating control panel wasn t working properly although the temperature was set te the max all u got was a ratteling noisy fan all night i ve previously paid half that and way better it has been also there is a minibar in the room however at the check in or when i booked the room at no poin it was mentioned that if u take anything out of it you would have to pay a fortune when i could of gone to sainsbury s across the road from the hotel and would of got bottles of vodka boyle of jd bottles of coca cola for way more cheaper only found out that i had to pay a fortune when i checked out i was asked if i ve taken anything from the minibar and i said yes told them what i had drunk and out of the blue with the smile on their face they said that would be i was shocked like i said i could of done a weekly shopping at sainsbury s including enough alcohol and soft drinks so yeah very very disappointing
