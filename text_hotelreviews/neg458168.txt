it was very cold in the room and heating is very slow it takes hours to heat the room and it is very cold when heating is not working the hotel card is not in the special place in the room euro of deposit till the check out is really bad thing because you should have extra money for that besides the hotel is not cheap i paid all the amount for the hotel on checking in and plus deposit euros but on checking out they asked me how would i pay buy cash or credit card it was a mistake but i was shocked the other bad thing there is the light behind the bad in room and it is turns on of automatically on moving sensor but in late evening when we were lying in our bad and this light turned on and off and on and off etc it was awful there is a shuttle bus for taking guests to the airport and it is not free for the hotel guests travelling back to the airport but it is not the real problem this shuttle is only for passengers and you should buy the tickets for it beforehand at the reception but they didn t told us this fact so when the shuttle arrived driver said it is fully booked it was one more bad experience with this hotel there is no minibar in the room in the restaurant on the floor after dinner they tried to charge from us extra euros when the waiter gave us the bill it was euros higher than should be we asked the waiter why our bill is so big and in a few minutes he bring another one with the right amount i will not recommend this hotel to other travellers
