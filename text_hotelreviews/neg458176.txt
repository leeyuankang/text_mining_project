very disappointed with food booked table in restaurant and chose fish of the day from the menu we were told it was a whitefish similar to sole or plaice we we brought two bowls full of squid and a bowl of chips delicious plus a bowl of salad each the chef who brought the meal could not explain why we had been given squid and not whitefish so we gave up and ate it not at all pleasant i think the hotel slightly exaggerates when it calls its eating facilities a restaurant
