bed was really weird in my room it had no headrest so i had to build some kind of pillow fort to support my head against while watching tv and to place myself diagonally on the bed so if my wife did the same we couldn t hug which is an issue for us mattress is also weird it s raised in the middle which doesn t help cuddling either so if you re a couple who fancies cuddling i wouldn t recommend this
