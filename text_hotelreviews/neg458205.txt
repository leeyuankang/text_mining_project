it is a bit far from the city center you can get there using the tram in mts which is great but if you are staying late at the center after am you have to look for night busses or cabs if it was closer you simply go back walking or by a bicycle there is no spa you can find a fitness room and a sauna but no real spa i think this would be a perfect addition the beds were good but not excelent from a comfort point of view
