party of of us stayed here and all rooms had cracked bathroom walls then there is a stench of dampness in all the bathrooms since the shower door is half a fixed door and only manages to cover half the shower so all the water gets out and floor is soaking which probably explains the dampy smell we were also not made aware there is a dress code to use their hyped up floor restaurant after driving hours with a young child to get there you just want to go in and eat sorry we do not make long drives about in our suits on a road trip for a star hotel i would say at most no toiletries at all except a bar of soap
