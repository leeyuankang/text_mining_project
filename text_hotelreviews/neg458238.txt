i wasn t too keen on the breakfast and the layout was abit all over the place eg bacon sausage egg and beans were all in different places would have been good if they were all together it was very pricey for a breakfast we also went up to floor for dinner looking at the website it described the bar menu which we thought we were getting instead it was the fine dining restaurant the menu was very confusing the food was good but would have been nice if we were asked which part we wanted to eat in as we hadn t been up there before and weren t aware they were separate
