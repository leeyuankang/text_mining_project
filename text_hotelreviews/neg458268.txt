room was very small and the location was slightly out of town although the tram no located just behind the hotel took you straight into central station the trams do close around midnight during the week so if you are planing late nights this hotel not for you as you will have to take a taxi home also no vending machines which i think would be a plus as they charge for a very small bottle of water which i think is a rip off
