the heating did not work in my room and the maintenance engineer was not available so a member of staff bought an oil heater it let off some heat but was not enough for a very cold winters day did not get much sleep at all also seemed to be an issue in the shower where the bathroom would flood each time the shower was turned on staff were friendly but my luck was that i happened to have a very poor room with many faults for the money i paid for the night and being my wifes birthday and our anniversary date i expected a lot more sorry for the poor review im just trying to give an honest account
