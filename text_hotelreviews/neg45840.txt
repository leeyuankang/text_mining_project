the staff new little about the area on arrival and made little effort to find out if you go to this hotel make sure they do not put you in a room next to the main road it s next to a hospital and i was kept awake by ambulances all night the room was mediocre and in my opinion not at all worth the money paid i m aware that this is london and you pay for the location but for a radisson i m very disappointed
