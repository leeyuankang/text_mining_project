the attitude of two or three different staff members when we asked for sweeteners for our hot drinks in the bar and restaurant they said they didn t have any even though we explained that they were on beverage trays in our room and so they must be available they went away to look and eventually found some but the attitude and lies created a very bad impression and was embarrassing
