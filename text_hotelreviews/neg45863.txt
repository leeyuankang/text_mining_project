superior room was tiny i doubt i would have paid for it but certainly not i barely had enough space to put my bag on the floor i was woken up every minutes or so by ambulances as the windows were right above the main street next to the hospital and the old windows did nothing to block the noise from the street below despite being advertised as having satellite television the channels were definitely not satellite tv and the wifi cut out every minutes or so staff were perfectly friendly though
