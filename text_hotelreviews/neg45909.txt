the room was very shabby and in need of a little tlc not quite up to star standard we also found half a carton of gone off milk in our mini bar the shower gel and shampoo were both empty and the seal on the shower door did not fit properly we went to the bar on the first evening and the service was terrible the barman was on his phone slumped against the back of the bar he didn t greet me or anything just looked up the only words he said to me was on your room not expected from a star hotel
