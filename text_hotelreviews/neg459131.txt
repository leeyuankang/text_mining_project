we stayed in room the shower attachment had a big leak due to which there was no pressure at the shower head there is no wardrobe okay for night but the space is inadequate for longer also the space is uncovered so whoever enters your room can see anything you have kept on the shelf wifi is not free we were asked to purchase a wifi package at the reception since i had a eu data bundle i didn t bother with the wifi no water bottle no information on mini bar rates finally someone had smoked pot in the corridor or one of the adjoining rooms so the smell was horrible outside
