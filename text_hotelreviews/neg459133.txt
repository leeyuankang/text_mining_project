this is not a five stars hotel not anywhere near one the room was ridiculously small given the price of it the ac did not work correctly which was a problem since i traveled during the heat wave in the netherlands when i asked if it could be fixed i was just replied that nothing could be done about that so much for a stars hotel the bathroom ventilation system s heavy noise kept me up almost all night they even have put toilet paper inside the device to limit the noise which does not work at all so much for a stars hotel dear mariott if you want to receive better ratings and comments better stop pretending to be what you are not live with what you are a decent stars hotel and stop fooling people i am not going to name any but there are plenty of stars hotels in amsterdam that are three times less pricey and three times better than this hotel
