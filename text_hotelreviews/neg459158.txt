absolutely disgusted with the room for a room plus tax and deposit on top with no breakfast the room was nothing like the pictures looked like it had been decorated in the s we had a dirty bathroom and found a half eaten apple left on the floor was completely disgusted as when we did raise this with the staff the lady was extremely extremely rude to us it was a one off joint birthday weekend away for myself and my sister and we were gutted tbh
