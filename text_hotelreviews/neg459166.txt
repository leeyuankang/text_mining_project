the renovated suites smells paint and since we have a kid we asked to change the room they changed our room from a junior suite to an old style suite and made us pay the difference that was unacceptable the cleaning of the suite was not done very good a dirty coffee cup was on our balcony since we checked in and stayed till we checked out but overall it was a pleasant experience would recommend this hotel
