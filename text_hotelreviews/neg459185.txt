breakfast was a little chaotic special orders when they are busy take a long time and were not delivered in a great way special orders on a quiet morning were excellent as was the buffet especially the fresh fruit check invoice before check out as there were some extras added to ours in error but were removed immediately and without issue when highlighted the excellent location is reflected in the price
