breakfast i had to wait longer than minutes to get a table and it was not a special event day the room was served by very poor powder coffee i think is very disappointing for a stars hotel to provide such a poor coffee the douche was leaked not enough water from the douch head and zero pressure generally speaking very old fashioned hotel bath rooms and lift require immediate renovation and the breakfast can be more diverse and less waiting time
