overpriced drinks in hotel bar euros for a glass of prosecco and euros for a large beer however this seems to be typical of large chain hotel bars so not really a surprise we booked a corner executive room for a touch of luxury over xmas mainly because it was a bigger size but it had the smallest bathroom i have ever seen in a hotel free wi fi very hit and miss all over hotel although you can pay to upgrade it
