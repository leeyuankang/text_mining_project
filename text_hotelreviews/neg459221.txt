wrong advice from reception staff that the van gogh museum was a five minute walk without considering that the guest was a yr old man the poor old guest was exhausted at the end of the walk and if we had more correct advice we would have booked a taxi one snobbish receptionist who said breakfast depends whether it is free or not when i knew well that i had booked a fare with free breakfast very cheap behaviour for a star hotel where a euro breakfast is hardly going to be a topic for haggling this receptionist was particularly unfriendly no smiles made me feel unwelcome then she appeared to teach me english when as you can see i write and speak perfect english was it because i had brown skin was this racism the hilton amsterdam just a few months ago had provided us with bathrobes and slippers in the room is this too much to have in your hotel the floor was cold
