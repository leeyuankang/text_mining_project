i booked an executive double for myself and my husband it was advertised on booking com as having a luxurious bathroom with a separate bathtub and rain shower there was a welcome note addressed to a different guest i was clearly allocated the wrong room no bathtub for a start it had a separate door to a shower cubicle the sink was in the main room there was another cubicle for the toilet it had an unnecessary extra bed taking up space perhaps that works if you have a child with you or are on a hen stag weekend but only chair to sit in the tv did not work and it took several calls before anyone came to fix it because the receptionist failed to pass on the requests to maintenance i was given a bottle of wine as an apology for the hour wasted getting someone to deal with it i disputed the room at the time and asked to be moved this was refused it was full and the person claiming to be a manager did not have any authority to refund me the price difference i requested a refund of roughly on my return when you pay city tax for a room for a night you should expect first rate customer service from the moment you enter the hotel and see the long line to check in with the receptionists taking other calls when they should be dealing with the person in front of them it is obvious service is not a priority here they have also failed several times now to respond to emails within their own service guidelines the first response was robotic and clearly used for all complaints i chased them up again and the second response failed to address the issue no separate bathroom i am told the room i had cost more really dream on that could only be if you are paying for an extra bed to be slot in more people i will try a third time i really feel this place is a shambles i wasted so much time while there and since my return no apology or acknowledgement they made a mistake with the room allocation
