this is my second and last stay at this hotel the desk personnel were rude on my first stay but i thought i might have caught someone having a bad day after this stay i know that customer service is not a priority i will stay elsewhere on my next trip to amsterdam and am so glad i booked a different hotel for when i return to amsterdam tomorrow
