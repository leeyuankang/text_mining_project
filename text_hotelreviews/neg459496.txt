although close to the museums it did take via tram to get into the foodie or city centre for the sights sounds there were no good food options around the hotel they were only tourist traps hard rock and a bad irish bar room service very expensive for mediocre food breakfast would not be worth the extra electronics in the room the telly and hair dryer didn t work room acceptable but bare bones no slippers robes or those other minor creature comforts loud next to the tram that ran between neighbouring walls were not sound proof we could hear the other guest and their telly service staff we had pre booked paid for a superior room we arrived around to check in and asked if there was a room available there wasn t but for a a day increase we could have an executive room available right now we did not take the option and opted to wait for the hotel s stated check in time of we left our bags with the porter and went out to explore the city we came back a little after to find our room was still not ready we were advised to go out and explore the city while the front desk found us a room we decided to wait this time in the lobby it was after when we went went up the desk where they informed us they had a room available we were advised to use a service lift at the back side of the lobby conference area it was strange but as we later found out all the nice rooms lifts were in the lobby and all the cheaper rooms had to use the service lift it wasn t a deal breaker what was was our room we step in and it stank of smoke regular cigarette we called down stairs and was advised a service agent would be up to the room the front desk agent came in and confirmed the room smelt of smoke ensured us as a property that does not allow smoking we would be moved
