the room was so small with an awful view out of the window the room was noisy throughout the whole night i can only compare the noise to furniture being dragged across the floor constantly therefore i did not get any rest at all but because it was for one night i managed i do not think it was value for money at all the hotel is over priced and over rated there were no luxuries at all i appreciate we booked a standard room but small gestures of things like a comfy dressing gown or some good quality miniature toiletries in the bathroom would have been nice touch and made our stay feel more special i can only compare our stay to that of other hotels we have stayed in around the same price of per night
