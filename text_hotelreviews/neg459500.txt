was given a room with two single beds instead of the double bed i booked early check in was not possible requested that beforehand so had to wait till there was some sort of mix up and at check out i was told that i have given a guarantee for another room to use the mini bar on my credit card never did that but was not charged in the end so that s ok the reason for the stay was my friends engagement i asked the manager whether it is possible to do something a bit more special for her free of charge but this was not possible the shower does not have a handheld shower head so not ideal if you have long hair and you don t want to get it wet don t like the shower cap solution was not told about the breakfast time at check in had to ask have to say the receipt did not make us feel welcome at arrival i think she was just finishing her shift and in a bit of a hurry the breakfast times are different on the weekend and weekdays so on monday morning we nearly missed it
