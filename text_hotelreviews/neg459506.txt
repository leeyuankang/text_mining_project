there is no extractor fan which would seem ideal when an open plan bathroom faint smell of damp entering the room had to air this out put do not disturb on the first day came back to a pile of new towels on our bed with a note that they didnt tidy up as dnd was on but had to access for security reasons didn t feel comfortable with this our hairdryer wasnt working and actually smoked when turned on i reported this and was questioned why i only reported this on my second day my partner towel dries and i only wash my hair every other day no milk provided in the free tea and coffee facilities so after brewing two teas on day realized we couldn t drink them forgot to buy milk whilst out so on his birthday morning decided to order x extortionate pots of tea at each doesnt mention in menu or hotel info anything about the additional charge for using room service euros for pots of tea id have been happy with just the milk pods or a cup but wouldnt have bothered if i knew about the additional charge overall lovely hotel but could be so much better if it wasnt for these little issues
