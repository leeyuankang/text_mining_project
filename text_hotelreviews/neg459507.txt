superior rooms are small cold and dark not comfortable i had to upgrade my room and pay more they tried to charge me more than my booking reservation i had to explain and discuss more than minutes to receptionist that they were doing wrong receptionists and other staff are not helpful you have to always wait at the reception because lack of receptionist i guess when you asked something to receptionist they said wait a minute and they were going to a room behind the desk and you had to wait them for a while for a simple answer i m totally disappointed with this hotel price value index is very low
