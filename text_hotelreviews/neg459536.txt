i didn t like checking in only to find that my bill had gone up by an extra euros before we started i didn t like the fact that for the per night we didn t have a wardrobe for this money you shouldn t have to live out of a suitcase i didn t like the the mis leading inference that we were going into a superior double room when in actual fact it seemed more like an abandoned staff living area the walls had black marks on every side and and we had to shuffle around the bed to move around the room which probably explains the marks we do this every year in a different place in europe and every other time we have given excelent for everything we were left with a sour taste with this one in reality out of season this stay was a complete rip off i would recomendamos amsterdam but not this hotel
