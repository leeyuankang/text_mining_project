communication from the manager when a pickup for a tour was cancelled her written note was delivered to our door hours after the cancelled pick up time and the note suggested the hotel would have provided a taxi for us however when this note arrived it was already too late the note was written two hours before the pickup time and if it had been delivered then we would not have missed the tour sad when all her staff were going above and beyond to be gracious to us and it was the manager that fell flat not her staff she should have made sure the note had some urgency to it and made arrangements for it to be delivered before the scheduled pickup and not after
