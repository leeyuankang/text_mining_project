the hidden deposit you must pay when you check in a night deposit i didn t see that written anywhere when i booked very misleading some people my age don t actually have to just put on hold until the end of their holiday or business trip especially if they re staying a week that s very very bad no other hotel i ve ever stayed in in amsterdam has ever taken a deposit i don t mind giving my card details incase of damages to the room etc but to actually ask for the money upfront is very bad
