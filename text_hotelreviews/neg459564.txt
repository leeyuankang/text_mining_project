i found the staff to be rude they took an extra when we arrived instead of holding a card so now i have to wait for the refund of that which is poor then when leaving they charged city tax which should be charged on arrival so that it s not a surprise what if i didn t realise and spent all my money because i knew i was going home did t like the hidden charges and they already upgraded us prior to going because we was unhappy with the shoddy service during booking
