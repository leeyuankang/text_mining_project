not sure if there was double glazing but as the hotel is on a busy inner ring road it wasn t the quietest but windows gave a panoramic view in compensation the stairs up to the bed bathroom are fairly steep and narrow so would not recommend for those with any sort of mobility problems the only thing missing to make it star was a swimming pool
