first room so small we couldn t even put our luggage anywhere and the bed was not a queen size as i originally booked and we were told twice worst part was the mattress was actually so soft and each sides hanging off the bed almost cm so you couldn t sit or sleep on the borders i had to make a complain and we were told they could put wood board under it to make it harder wooden board in a night hotel incredible we were told we couldn t be moved in another room as the hotel was fully booked and we would have to pay night extra for an upgrade i was so upset they accepted to move us to another room the night after the room was much bigger the bed was indeed a queen side bed and still hanging off on the corners and we were told it was the same room rate why the huge difference then at the end we were told the room was actually an upgrade they offered so the simple double room with a queen size bed does not exist staff was helpful but we were still disappointed second room was with a view on the main road and the windows were really bad noise insulated parking is night
