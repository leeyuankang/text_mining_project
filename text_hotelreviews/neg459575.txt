we felt the property was tired and not well maintained as visible repairs looked like they were made by an amateur when we arrived late at night we went to our room only to find we had been given single beds instead of the double requested it took approximately mins for the front of house staff to move the beds together and then the beds were so soft we almost disappeared into the mattress also for almost every request we made at the front desk over the weekend the staff at the counter had to check with someone in the back room before providing a response overall we were not impressed with the property and would not stay here again
