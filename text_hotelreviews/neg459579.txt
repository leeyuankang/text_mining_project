from arrival our experience was a bit tense we landed in the evening and got to the hotel around we waited for a long time by the front desk where no employees could be seen a couple of times bellhops or other sort of employees came past but apparently they weren t the sort who could check us in finally we called out hello and two women came out from a door behind the desk the one who helped us completely ignored me and asked my husband what name the room was under i jumped in and said i made the reservation the name is but that was a little bit of covert sexism the lady proceeded to check us in but mixed up what our reservation was tried to charge us for the room which i had to remind her was prepaid then she printed keys and sent us off when we arrived to our room it was a very small slightly musty twin room where i had paid a premium through booking com to have a superior double room i called down to the desk to point out the mix up and was helped by a man who seemed to have good intentions but informed me that there was nothing he could do about it for that night but that we d be changed in the morning to an executive double room so we made do but the twin version of the wonderful double bed that we eventually got was extremely uncomfortable so soft that i was constantly waking up feeling like i was falling off of it when we got back from sightseeing the next day we checked in again at the front desk to get keys for our new promised room the woman behind the desk asked several times for my name and seemed confused kept stepping into the back room and talking with a man who we couldn t see overall we waited for about minutes expecting to understand what the hold up was but ultimately she eventually just handed us the keys and told us the room number then went back to the back room
