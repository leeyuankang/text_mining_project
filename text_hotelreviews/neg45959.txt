the single room was extremely small renovated perhaps a decade ago the hotel had problems with credit card authorisation and the anxious staff would send me in the middle of the night to withdraw cash i was having a drink at the hotel bar at night and saw a mouse running through it i refrained from any intervention but it was certainly chilling overall the location is fantastic but the hotel is below four stars and offers little comfort i do not recommend it if you have any other decent options
