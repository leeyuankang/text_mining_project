we had the junior split level but was very disappointed especially when we paid about just for nights not worth the money at all the furniture is so so dated especially down stairs also our flight was not until and we asked if we could stay an hour extra for check out until and the receptionist refused it was also very noisy when the window is open as it did get warm in the room
