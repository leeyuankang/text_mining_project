the window in the bedroom rattled all night despite me attempting to wedge it closed room there was a strong wind in london that evening but i do think this needs attention very disappointed with breakfast shown to a table and told your server will be with you shortly no one ever appeared therefore apart from the glass of water i managed to get myself i had no beverages the cooked breakfast was lacking i waited a very long time for eggs to be ready by which time i d eaten the remainder of the breakfast as i was running out of time poor food planning and disappointing restaurant staffing hotel reception staff extremely helpful
