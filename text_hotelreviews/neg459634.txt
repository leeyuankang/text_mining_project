when we booked our room we were informed that there wasn t a superior double room with wheelchair accessibility and the room category does not exist with wheelchair accessibility we were offered an executive room with wheelchair accessibility with a supplement of eur per night we were not happy with this so we sent an e mail saying we didn t think we should pay extra for having a disability we were then told that we could have the executive room at no extra cost this should be a standard procedure and not expecting the guest to pay extra
