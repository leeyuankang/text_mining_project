the room descriptions are very misleading we booked a so called superior room assuming that as a fairly late booking there were standard rooms which had already booked up and were not available we found that the superior room was in fact their basic standard room it was minute with no separate bath room just a screened area it was no larger than a travellodge room at or times the price although we realised that the central location would be expensive we upgraded to the next size room which would normally have been euros more but they let us have one for euros more they need to make clear the sizes of the rooms and hotels should not use the description superior if there are no standard rooms as a comparison nb the room price was reasonable value given the location for weekdays but prices increase hugely at weekends our friday night there was almost double the thursday
