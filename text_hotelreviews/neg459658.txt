whilst the hotel was well located and had a very good restaurant the staff behaved appallingly every phone call from my room whether i was connected or not was charged on one occasion i asked the hotel operator to dial a number in sierra leone but i could not get through shortly afterwards i found four armed policeman knocking on my door and asking to come in they fully searched my room and myself and left it in an awful state when i asked why they had come they said that i have been trying to make a call to syria the operator had obviously confused sierra leone with syria i also booked my hotel on a daily basis as i was never sure how long i would be in amsterdam the hotel manager also commented on the fact that i ve been wearing the same pullover for over two days all this made them think i was a terrorist and therefore they called the police the hotel never offered to tidy up my room nor did they offer an excuse for their inexcusable behaviour instead they told me never to come back to the hotel i have stayed in many other good hotels in amsterdam and i strongly recommend you to choose one of these
