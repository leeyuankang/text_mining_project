i asked for a double room at the time of reservation but we got a twin one instead the mini bar charge was more than what we consumed luckily i spotted this at checkout and it got fixed immediately euro person day for breakfast is a bit unrealistic a bit too expensive from what it had to offer room was a bit cold even with the heater maxed out i started to get weird unauthorized transactions with travel reservation as a reference the day after the checkout and eventually had to cancel my card and get a new one not sure if related to the hotel but it s the only place i used the card in question while in amsterdam
