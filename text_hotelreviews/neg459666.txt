from the start our experience was bad there was only one person on check in so we had to queue having been allcated our rooms we had to change them as we had specified adjacent or interconnecting rooms which they failed to do we then had to queue up again for the one person still on reception and minutes later were allocated adjacent rooms but one of the rooms had a smell of drains which i reported and which the very discourteous duty manager thalia refused to deal with in fact she told me several times that i was wrong the rooms were small the beds very soft and the shower and toilet were part of the bedroom the smell of drains was coming from the shower for such an expensive hotel this was unacceptable especially the way the duty manager treated her customers i don t think i have ever encountered a more unpleasant manner in my many years of travelling
