the hotel is rated stars and the room was advertised as superior and spacious however the room was tiny it had a small double bed not queen size and no space to store luggage which are both basic requirements to be classified a star hotel i discussed this with staff and was offered portable storage racks but of course there was no space to put them disappointing
