rude and unfriendly reception staff extra charge of for early check in at pm they didn t accept any of my debit cards never had a problem elsewhere but they need credit card only regardless the fact that the full amount for whole stay was paid in cash at the time of check in asked to pay deposit in cash when we checked out and i asked for a deposit back we had to wait minutes while someone checks a room and minibar the price for the room displayed on booking com and booking confirmation does not include tax so actual price is higher this we found out at the time of check out when this tax was deducted from deposit
