this is the first time i encountered problems with early check in in these years that i booked through booking com and not the flexibility to change the room that i requested the hotel staff who assisted me has not much authority and confidence in assisting to my requests although she did try to help i was so afraid that she s on duty each time as i know i cannot get much help from her
