parking night breakfast is very little and no variety some of staff are bad in service they promise to do a service and they dont one day we did not have our room cleaned they forgot very very very small rooms and bathrooms balcony does not open only looks like a show some small light in balcony stays on for the full night so gets harder to sleep no concierge reception is always full if you have any questions
