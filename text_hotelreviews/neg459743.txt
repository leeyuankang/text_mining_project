front desk staff was very unfriendly upon checkin they appeared unhappy and service was slow also they told us we had a room with two beds but when we got to the room there was only one bed when we complained they said they could move us but would charge us an extra per night we ended up swapping rooms with a friend who had two beds at the same price as ours with one bed
