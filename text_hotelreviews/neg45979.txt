the windows to our room were useless they did not keep out any of the passing noise all night in a hotel of this calibre i would expect that windows would be sound proof from the outdoor activities to ensure a good nights sleep also the fire alarm was sounded apparently by next doors building as they are on the same circuit this disturbed our sleep and we had a dreadful night the air conditioning unit was very loud and therefore we had to turn this off resulting in being very warm
