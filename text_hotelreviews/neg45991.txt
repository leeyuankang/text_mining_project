the hotel did not read my booking properly and allocated a double rather than a twin initially they said that they were full and therefore nothing could be done which was highly irritating after a long journey however the house manager sorted it out admirably and we eventually got the room we should have had the girl on the greeting station on sunday morning breakfast was rude and didn t know what she was doing fortunately a more capable member of staff was on hand to sort things out and was wonderful
