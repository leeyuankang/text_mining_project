room slightly small but very comfortable i did feel rushed at breakfast as staff were clearing away at and i was offered just one cup of tea that was fairly lukewarm and didnt see a waiter to ask for another last entrance is but there wasn t much on the bars by one helpful waiter got extra juice as the kids there were finishing it before it settled on the bar then i heard a staff member appear to chastise him for it he wasnt speaking english so i dont know what he said though maybe they should speak english to each other seeing as we are in england also i m sure when i arrived when i was being taken to the table another waiter quipped lunch to the guy showing me to the table it was i think they must be under pressure to get things finished by so if that s the case don t say breakfast is served until other than that a nice hotel
