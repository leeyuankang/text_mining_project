the worst hotel i ve stayed in recent years we booked three rooms and paid by credit card five months ago when we arrived the receptionist only can find two room records but cannot find the one they asked me to call booking and said it should be booking s fault when i used the phone in the reception i requested to check the room in their reservation system again they found that the room we booked had been checked in by others wrong guest stayed in our room used our booking records though they found the mistake they didn t apologize to us and let us wait for a long time to get another room so rude staffs it s really bad experience in london
