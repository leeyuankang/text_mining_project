we booked two rooms with an inter connecting door this was supplied and but the staff could not obtain a key to unlock the door when we returned in the evening therefore two separate room which was not what we wanted very disappointing after all the trouble trevor the manager on duty when we arrived went to to ensure we had connecting rooms shame he was not there when we got back in the evening
