room could have had better air conditioning quite frankly i don t think it was working at all the wall panel setting indicated deg which would be like the north face of the eiger yet it felt like the tropics so no i don t think it was working and i ended up opening the windows which meant quite a high level of ambient noise this is not a real negative but i will mention it anyway the tv remote control was infuriatingly slow and made it was quite difficult to select a channel accurately
