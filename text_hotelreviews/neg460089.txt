stayed at this hotel three years ago and had a fantastic stay that s why i didn t mind paying over pound this time around for only four nights that is a lot of money to spend on a room for a short stay phoned room service which is meant to be and theh had nothing to eat so actually had to phone a take away service for food as the mini fridge did not get re stocked or did the coffees and teas for the room phoned down for extra and there was none facilities just weren t good this time at all when paying that amount of money for a good hotel you expect to have coffee in the room and room service when it says don t think i ll be staying again as even the staff were rude when complainging polity when i was checking out the amount of money i spent and all they could offer me was a free breakfast buffet if i stayed again when i couldn t even order myself food when i was there in the first place
