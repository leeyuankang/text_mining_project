i called a few days before to ask if we could drop our cases when we got to london the reservationist said that we could but he d also request early check in for us when we got there the room wasn t ready which wasn t a problem but carlos changed our room to a twin i thought that was what i d booked anyway stored our cases for us until our return we returned at about but the room wasn t ready but we were offered a double instead due to time constraints we took it the room was basically a single room with a double bed squashed in very claustrophobic and not enough room for adults over priced for what we got and very disappointing the only saving grace was the amenities in the room they were very good
