the ac didn t work in both the rooms that we had booked on the day we stayed had to cancel one of the rooms that my friend was supposed to stay my room ac also didn t work and when i called for assistance the lady who came already had a small fan in her hand when she entered the room and then said we didn t know that the ac wasn t working how did she know to bring the fan along when asked anyone can repair it she said its a weekend so we dont have anyone until monday a star hotel saying this reason is unbelievable so we slept that day in the same room because there was no other vacancy with the small fan next day we were moved to another room which again didn t work with the ac overnight and it got heated up to c again complained the manager on the day was helpful and tried to move us to an other room by evening better one of the lot so in a nutshell we were moved to different rooms in days not really impressed at all
