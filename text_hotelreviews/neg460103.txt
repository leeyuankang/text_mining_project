if you are travelling with pet the staff might stress you out i payed euros for my dog a really tiny dog and first they told me im not allowed to leave my dog alone in the room after trying to explain i ve booked some tickets to some museums they said i have to keep my dog in a cage and that also applies to when we go for breakfast very dissapointed abou the pet policy rooms are very small comparing to what i ve booked on booking the room is not part of a hotel rather a star hotel
