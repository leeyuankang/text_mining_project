the hotel was very overpriced for what it was breakfast was expensive with not a lot of choices offered the breakfast room seemed understaffed and lacking in items such as plates and cutlery and restocking of food items was very slow the concierge desk was sporadically staffed leaving the reception when there was staff available to handle enquiries whilst it was not an over all bad experience there were certainly more minuses than pluses and we do not feel it merits the rating it has
