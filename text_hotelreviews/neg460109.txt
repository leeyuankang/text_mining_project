we paid for a standard room with a view first they gave us room which had the view partially blocked due to the architecture of the building we requested a change and were placed in room which had a clear view however both rooms had old furniture which looks a little depressing the breakfast buffet was good with the exception of the scrambled eggs which were tasteless one morning breakfast was being served till and when we arrived at am alot of items like cold cuts fresh fruit and pastries were finished and not being replaced which i thought was rude since a few other guests were walking in
