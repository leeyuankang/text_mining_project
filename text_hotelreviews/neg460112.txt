rooms could be updated floors in the room were badly chipped and scored bathrooms are very small so small you could run a bath run the sink taps while on the toilet minor flaws i know i just want to give as honest a review as possible breakfast is well catered really suited for small familys or a couple looking for a quiet break dam spuare is about to minute walk with alot of restaurants shops and sites along the way or a tram or bus ride directly to the spuare right outside the hotel door
