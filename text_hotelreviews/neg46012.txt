i arrived at the hotel around which is way after their standard check in time the receptionist did not apologize and just said i had to wait because the room was not ready i had planned to get refreshed to go out for a musical so after i told her i had to drop my luggage in the room even if a cleaner is in it and head on she reacted as if she was doing me a major favour and passed me the room key bad check in experience never had this before then the breakfast it is supposed to start from and there were over people waiting at the entrance the staff were clearly not ready i happened to be the first to be asked for the room number then somehow the staff decided to take me straight to a table while rest of the guests started taking tables at random total lack of structure organization no explanation whatsoever how nor who will be serving tea or coffee after being seated i went for scrambled eggs but it wasn t there at so i asked and one staff just pointed at the display table saying it s there another staff said it was coming in it was delivered around and it was more like some milky soup than anything the pastries were of good quality but the coffee tasted like powder i would not pay quid for a breakfast of such low quality if i knew it in advance i hope this was one off like the change of management first day
