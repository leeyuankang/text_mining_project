on arriving were sent to a room which had been used by previous visitors bed had been sat on dirty coffee cups rubbish in bin and on the surface reception had sent us to a room change without telling housekeeping we were transferred to a smaller room at back of hotel very small and tired looking room chipped old painted furniture and tired wallpaper mould in grouting in bathroom bathroom need a steam clean the toilet was placed in such a small cramped space was hardly room to use it tea and coffee was not replaced daily the tiny piece of soap was not replaced as it became a slither pillows were different shapes and sizes the view was directly into the hillfiger offices to the rear breakfast was so expensive we gave it a miss the redeeming point was the friendly attitude of both housekeeping and reception staff throughout our stay a standard room may well be basic and have less features but should still be fresh bright inviting and have all the comforts for a restful stay the rooms need upgrading
