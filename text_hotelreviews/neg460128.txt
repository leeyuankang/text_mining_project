the staff were rude unhelpful and tried to charge things to our room that wasn t right they also only gave us back from a deposit because of city tax which was wrong and they only gave back the right amount of money once confronted so please make sure you check your room bill there is alot of building and road work going on outside so it can be loud and also it s not a pretty site
