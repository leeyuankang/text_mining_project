when i booked i asked specifically for a quiet room because i needed a good rest after days of work in amsterdam i was given a room at the first floor between the ice machine and the entrance of the mariott on the street those nights were hell i could not sleep i told the friendly reception people and they told me i could have a better room higher in the floors but more expensive they just don t care the room was not fresh the cleaning approximative found a long dark hair in the bathroom for me it was a bad experience far too expensive for the quality offered but when you have so many non returning customers it does not matter
