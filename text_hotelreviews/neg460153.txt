corporate hotel syndrome nothing is very bad but nothing very good either faceless beige room robotic staff ridiculously overdesigned shower and security box a demand to hand over guarantee of euro plus full price when checking in clean looking at first glance but an inch of dust on the radiators which they expect visitors to see as you have to turn them on so probably not all that clean at all in fact my room was not cleaned on my second day there even though i did not use a do not disturb sign had to call housekeeping to change my towels generally i got the impression of inadequate staff very likely to be inadequately paid
