restaurant staff some of them were rude and at times i felt bullied rather than served my table was not ready for the time booked and i was told to go out and wait in the restaurant there was a substantial puddle of some sort at the side of my table and it was cleaned only after me asking someone to do it there was no bedside table to accompany the bed and no saucers to accompany teacups in my room i ordered a wake up call but it never came shower facilities were primitive with water unable to sustain stable temperature the shower tray was old and scratched temperature adjustment button did not work the sink was blocked there was a wrong date displayed on the telephone display overall all this would be ok in a budget hotel but i booked this one because i know what radisson manchester is like and believed that the standards should be the same in every radisson hotel when a friend of mine stayed in manchester she even had a dressing gown and slippers at her disposal and she could choose between harder or softer pillows
