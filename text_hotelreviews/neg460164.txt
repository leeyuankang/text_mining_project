the price quoted for breakfast when we checked in was very high about euros when i asked about it on the first morning i was told that it was now more expensive euros although this had not been indicated when we checked in the manager said he was unable to reduce this price as the system would not let him as a result we took breakfast at the marriot hotel next door which was much more reasonable and flexible there were also issues with a room fridge not working and a room not properly cleaned
