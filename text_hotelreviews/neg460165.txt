during our visit the hotel clearly had some sanitation issues as the first floor was pungent with stagnant water sewage in our room the shower screen door seal did not work correctly and water went on the floor our room was so dark that i would suggest bringing a torch joking aside i would suggest brighter bulbs or more lights as it did not create ambience it just made it hard to see
