the hotel is under construction and this wasn t mentioned when making the reservation therefore there was a construction blanket on top of the hotel and the rooms weren t getting any light and all you could see out the window is scaffolding for a queen bed they had two single comforters which was really uncomfortable the heating system inside the room was working but the controller for the heating system was broken so it was really hard to navigate that considering the price of euros for two nights this was the worst hotel stay for that price i ve ever stayed at
