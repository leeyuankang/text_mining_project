we paid for a double room but were put in a room that was even smaller than the single rooms shown on the hotel website there wasn t even room to get into the bed on one side so i had to clamber over my husband to go to bed the bedside light didn t work and the window was broken and wouldn t close so we were woken up as soon as the traffic started and couldn t get back to sleep because of the noise there wasn t even a proper bed it was more like a cot bed with an incredibly thin mattress i was quite disgusted with the room and the fact that we were put in there when i complained the following day there wasn t much of an apology but at least we were moved to a double room i was told that the hotel was busy which i don t think is an acceptable excuse for putting us in a room far below the standard we d paid for in both of the rooms the furniture and floors were quite badly scuffed and chipped and needed updating
