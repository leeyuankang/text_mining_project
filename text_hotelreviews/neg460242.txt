room was very small and outdated especially for the price paid small bathroom handle on one of the windows was missing this was just taped over instead of being repaired had a bad night sleep because of a regular buzzing noise during the night the duvet was also very narrow small and of a horrible synthetic quality so i was hot and sweaty all night when we got up the next morning to have breakfast the hallway was filled with the pungent smell of marihuana i wouldn t stay here again
