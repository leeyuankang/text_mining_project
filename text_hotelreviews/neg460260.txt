due to technical problems on their part i didn t get a keycard to my room before hour before departure which meant the staff had to show me all the way to my room to let me in most of the staff was really friendly but waiting in line at the reception for minutes to get access to a room you paid a lot for is totally unacceptable the second day the staff started to ask for id every time i wanted to go the my room i m never coming back to nh room is quite small there was people sleeping laying down in the lobby at midnight which felt odd
