for a world class chain one would expect them to contact you back after you complain about a major miss from their front desk team but that feedback didn t happen who cares if any one ends up booing this place please be aware that you shall receive a text message with a link that will take you through a process of an online check in where you pick your room and pay for it that what has happened with me and an hour after my payment was successful i received another text taking me to the payment page again i contacted booking com team who kindly contacted the hotel but the hotel said they don t send customers any text messages to me it is now a fraud i cancelled my card and shockingly when i arrived at the hotel the front desk person said that they do send texts for the customers to do an online check in and that the card i used didn t go through and i have to pay again a few days after i found the payment they say it was declined appearing on my bank statement so again i called them and shockingly the person taking the call declined them sending any texts to customers so after speaking to many others they paid back my money i emailed a complaint and in vodafone kind of style they chose to completely ignore me thanks never again
