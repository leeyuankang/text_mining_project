the policy of thehotel is to charge the first night by keeping the amount as guarantee they say that in reality they do notcharge it but for me when i cannot use the amount they keep as guarantee is the same which of course is being returned back after a month and not days it is absolutely understood when i made a name change in my reservation and only that not change of number of persons or date they kept second time the amount from my card why since they secured my card was valid on the first time and since i did not change the card number of the resrvation just the name instead of mine i put my husbund s isn t it a bit over the top to keep twice the same amount from my card whn my reservation was free cancellation anyway that was the only drawback
