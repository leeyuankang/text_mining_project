the room we got was really small and we could hardly move around plus the guy who served us made us pay a completely different rate to what we initially booked online for arriving late at the desk no amenities except for the restaurant downstairs and rather a basic hotel in one of the many radisson blu chains ok if you re just stopping for one night and are heading out the next day but wasn t worth the price
