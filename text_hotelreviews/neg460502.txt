no parking space nearby on our arrival we called many time but no one picked the phone the walls need repainting as there are scratches on my room wall the robes are old and the threads are coming out the corridor carpet has big stains some of the evening time chocolate cake they leave at our rooms contained alcohol if you are muslim just be careful the concierge staff are so unprofessional any service they do for you they expect money in return the moroccan guy from the concierge tried to collect money from different members of my family for the luggage delivery to two of our rooms he literally asked where is my tip even though he knew that my husband will give him a tip but he tried to get a tip from both rooms and because there is no parking in the hotel which is so annoying we needed something from our car and another concierge member has offered to bring it however when we went down to the hotel gate i heard him complaining to the other concierge member that we requested something from our car and when he saw us he tried to patch the conversation he got us what we need after maybe hours then he was repeating that i got you what you need it was clear that he meant he needs another tip beside the good we gave him on the arrival day also on the third day we requested our car the concierge introduced a third member of their staff that brought us the car and they said our colleague brought you the car and he is a good driver pla pla pla it was also clear that they are requesting a tip i have never been to hotel where the concierge made us really nervous i hope the hotel work on their concierge staff
