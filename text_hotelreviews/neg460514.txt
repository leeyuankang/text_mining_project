the devil is in the detail and the designer should be forced to live in this room for a year why because it s a triumph of style over practicality the room funnels out from the doorway and at the doorway the narrowest part of the space you are somehow meant to store suitcases hang clothes etc but there is no closet space the hanging rail takes a couple of small jackets and the drawers are great for a pair of socks no kidding you walk backwards and forwards over metres up and down steps to find anything the bathrobes are greying and frayed around collar and cuffs the hand basin is black glass chipped sends water everywhere and never looks clean the chambermaids must hate it and when you look at the detail of steps skirting and so on you realise the interior is tired and well past its refit date because if you operate a design hotel that s intended to be cutting edge in style these are the small things you have to keep on top of
