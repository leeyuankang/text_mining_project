if i had to pick anything only slight thing was no tea and coffee making facilities in the room i requested an high floor room as being in the main square i thought it would be noisy one thing to note is this hotel is upside down in that reception is on floor and rooms on floors and we ended up on floor six which meant we could hear the bar at night from our room wasn t an issue for us but if you want peace and quiet pick a lower floor
