the breakfast is not quite as good as it used to be it needs granola or muesli fresh berries and would be enhanced with bircher muesli which it may have supplied in the past they do make a cappuccino but i d like to see it made on a large italian espresso machine so it is creamy rather than the usual froth on top of the coffee style it would help in the bathroom if the great heating towel rack worked for drying clothes the toilet door also keeps closing on you i had this problem in another room too
