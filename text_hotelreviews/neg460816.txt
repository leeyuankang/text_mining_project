the only thing i was disappointed was about the size of the room i thought our room would be bigger as like on the website however on arrival we were told as i requested twin beds there wasn t a room with a city view river view available but yet i did book this in february this year and as my request was acknowledged at the time of my booking i would of expected a room with the better view i also felt the room was smaller than the deluxe rooms advertised on the website
