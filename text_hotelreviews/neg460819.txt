the room was very disappointing as ordered junior suit with river view whilst river view was lovely room was quite small with only chair and no facility for having breakfast in room no floor length mirror in room also having paid a lot of money for room we were charged for sunday papers which we thought was appalling dinner dance saturday evening very disappointing as venue was poor due to constant coming and going to and from bar and main restaurant didn t like music and had to wait long time between courses
