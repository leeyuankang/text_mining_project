poor service at dinner regarding gluten free options when asked for a salad it came covered in croutons the waiter was asked politely if it could be changed it was taken away and no replacement came it was an expensive meal and not worth the money we ate out at lunch time and if we were late back we went to sainsburys across the road and bought a sandwich much simpler to get a gluten free choice there the room was clean but smalla and had a view of the alley at the back of the hotel which was noisy with people talking at night breakfast good
