we had a room in the floor on the carting ln side of the building there is a kind of logistic centre dhl in this street it also seems to be the main access for delivery trucks and waste disposal for the hotel the noise after in the morning also sat sun felt like sleeping next to a recycling lot we were actually too lazy to ask for a room change and just lived with it however noise sensitive people should definitely ask for a room on the other side of the building i also think that a hotel of this standard room night should make the investment in modern window insulation in areas where noise from outside is unavoidable
