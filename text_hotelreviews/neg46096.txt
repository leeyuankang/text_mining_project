be careful to sleep at the right side of the hotel meaning not at the side of the street we first got a room at the street side and it was very noisy i knew we could not sleep there so we asked for a room on the other side which was great and quiet bring your earplugs just to be sure second what we found very strange is that the breakfast could be better organised every day there were lines waiting for breakfast we had a min wait on saturday morning if you come around am the waits are gone
