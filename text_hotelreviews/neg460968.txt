at some point i was running late only had quid and wanted quid to tip the doorman when i got into my taxi i asked the receptionist to give me three pounds and to put it on my bill he gave me a story about it not being hotel policy to give clients cash advances at quid a night if you cannot accommodate a client for pounds with a charge then there is something wrong either with the receptionist or with the hotel policy i explained to the guy that this really made me feel not at home and that keeping clients really meant that u made clients feel at home he was not interested i waited for the colleague who was also not perturbed by my story to bring change for my banknote from some other place in the hotel i find it crazy that you keep a client waiting who tells u he is late because u dont want to give him pounds and charge it to his room they actually lost a client over quid and besides booking with you i have used other booking engines to stay there i think i have stayed there at least times in the last months which is more than rooms as i often travel with other parties i dont think this would bother them it would bother me if i owned this hotel they will not see me again there is some thing wrong with the mentality of assisting a client and extending hospitality anyhow we all have our opinions and clearly theirs is different from mine they will survive without me lol and ill certainly find other star hotels n london in which to stay
