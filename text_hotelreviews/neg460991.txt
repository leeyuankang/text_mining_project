we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and choose the savoy as though it was the best hotel in london but i think the hotel staff could of done more to make our trip an experience to remember maybe a card bottle of champaign in room or fresh flowers the room was very basic had a lovely view apart from the net overall i will probably never stay again but enjoyed the experience
