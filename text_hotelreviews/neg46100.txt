room was so small and smelled as an ashtray staff was not really helpful the hotel need a serious renovation as it s outdated and shabby the bed size was also smaller than in any hotels i stayed before the breakfast starts at which is too late already but they start it at on saturdays so i had to go to the airport without having breakfast and yes they do have a huge construction site right in front of the window and you can hear all the sounds of constructing from avoid this hotel
