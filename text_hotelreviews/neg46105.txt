we stayed for a full week although the breakfast food was good it could be more varied e g breads cheeses eggs cereals it would be nice to have some basic vegetables in addition to nice fruit that was offered the dining room staff could be more efficient in serving coffee actually good coffee re filling items on the buffet table etc the toaster is awful several of the tables wobble room is very nice and quiet but the bathroom is so tiny and hard to maneuver in it
