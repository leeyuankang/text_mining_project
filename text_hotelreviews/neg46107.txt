room far too hot air con didn t work but there was a window which opened rare in london but still hot room the corridor outside the room was the part of the corridor floor which was laminated tiles and not carpeted so ladies heels clumping pass all night meant we didn t sleep much and people s voices carried down the corridors shame because we liked the hotel and staff and room layout though bathroom would not fit someone bigger than size between the door and sink just wish we had managed to get some decent sleep reported it to staff next day who did apologise tip check your room has carpet outside
