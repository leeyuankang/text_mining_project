a screw fell out of the wardrobe door and it was hanging off for the duration of our stay we didn t report it until we left the soap dispenser in the bathroom was broken and despite reporting it it wasn t fixed until we left a written note beside it the steps inside the room which my husband managed to fall down when he got up in the middle of the night and no he hadn t been drinking no bedside lamps so i had to read at night by the ceiling light room was comfortable but the word deluxe has been much misused here
