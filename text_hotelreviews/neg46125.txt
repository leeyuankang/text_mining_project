breakfast was not well organised apart from toast all food was on one counter so even if you just wanted a croissant or a bowl of cereal you had to queue with everyone else we waited mins to be asked if we wanted anything off the menu and having finished our breakfast still hadn t been asked about tea or coffee i eventually went off to find a waiter with a coffee jug we were obviously sat in an area where our designated waiter was off having his own breakfast a shame as everything else was good
