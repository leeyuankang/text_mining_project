nothing was what i was expecting rooms very small boring design staff kept changing their statements of what they said and what they did not say i arrived after long travel at about i went to the room it was like a prison cage when i asked to change my room they asked me to wait in the room and they will call me back no one called for more than minutes i tried to call reception was not picking up i had to go down to the reception around they said nothing was available so i had to upgrade the lady at the reception told me the smaller suite sells for more than pounds per night i said this is more than my budget she asked how much is your budget i said pounds she made a few calls and said she found me something i had to sign a paper and i am all set tired and late at nigh i put the pen on paper and went to the room the room was really really horrible a small living area with stairs going up to a tiny place the could hardly hold the bed i thought i was in one of those fairy tale dreams in a bad way of course after three nights what i was checking out they present me with a huge invoice at the reception i asked what is this they said this is the pounds that i had already paid at the time of booking online plus the pounds upgrade it really blew my mind i said the lady clearly said the room sells for per night and she will lower it for me to how come it became suddenly doing all the math they could not explain the situation finally i was confronted with a paper that i had signed late at night trusting their words that it was the upgrade price not total price i repeatedly asked how will do the math saying the room was selling for and now you want me to pay no explanation after making a lot of fuss one of the staff told me we can waive one night upgrade price very unprofessional worst rooms and bad location
