bar used to be so busy but was lacking any kind of atmosphere although the drinks were good it was more like a luxury budget hotel than a luxury hotel i usually stay at the bvlgari which to me is absolute luxury but wanted to give the mayfair a chance only one towel in the bathroom upon arrival it always intrigues me when the minibar is one that immediately charges you if you move any of the drinks it makes me wonder what type of people stay here for them to install such a minibar
