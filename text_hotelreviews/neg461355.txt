the room was quite basic and lacked finesse such as no trim between the carpet in the room and bathroom tiles with a bit of a gap present and generally just did not feel as luxurious as you would expect i have stayed in many hotels around the capital and abroad and have never had to pay extra to use the spa and fitness facilities which you would expect included in the room rate the amount of money is negligible but you end up feeling like your on a budget flight to kavos rather than in a luxury central london hotel disclaimer i have never been on a budget flight to kavos
