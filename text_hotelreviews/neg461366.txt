breakfast staff didnt seem to have a clue what was going on and had to order breakfast twice i felt this stay in this hotel was not a five star experience long walk to an upgraded room at a cost and felt it was not worth the extra per night that i paid i have stayed at the radison blue in manachester and that was a five star experience i just do not think our two night stay room only was worth it was five star cost but not star quality the view from the small window in the room was just over looking over rooms
