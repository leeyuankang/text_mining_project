unfortunately i didn t sleep a wink we was in a room at the back of the hotel which housed several generators these kept humming all night and to make things worse we had scaffolding approximately meters away from our window with workman starting work early in the morning approx ish these were really loud with all sorts of hammering and drilling spoilt my experience really as i was too tired during the day
