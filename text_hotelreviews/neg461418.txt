the trouble with this hotel is that there is really no place to sit down if you just want to relax you can go to the bar but after early evening this is a very noisy place with loud music they have again redecorated the restaurant and made it modern in a way that it is not a cosy place anymore the lobby is too busy crowded with people checking in and out all day and not at all a place to sit down it then leaves you with your room my room this time was rather small with one little chair in the corner and no bedspread when you pay around pounds per night you expect a bedspread or something like it on your bed all in all this is a hotel for younger rich people if you want your hotel in london to be a home from home then this is not the place
