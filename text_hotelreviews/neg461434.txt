don t bother with this hotel they cater to businessmen therefore the rooms are not functional nor conducive to a woman s use the closet and bathroom is one large room with no separation so if someone was using the bathroom than the other person cannot access their clothes luggage without disrupting the person who is using it cons not enough lighting no outlets in bathroom none no shelf in shower no place in shower to set personal items no seat in shower no door on shower no water pressure heated towel bar a foot walking outside the shower handheld shower heads are placed at waist level way too low on wall in shower and spray right out the glass opening getting the bathroom floor all wet polished natural stone on bathroom floor creates an extremely slippery floor in bathroom not safe clothes hanging in closet portion absorb moisture from shower and orders from toilet use closet area has black walls and black floor with insufficient lighting we had to use our cell phones light in order to see inside our suitcases no privacy men in the building directly across the way stand in the window and talking on the phone and while they conduct business they stare directly into our room at the same floor level no nespresso maker they said they would bring one and never did even when we asked a second time no help from the front desk who kept referring us to housekeeping who we had already spoken to and they were also no help restaurant is extremely over priced they only sell tapas we had each total small salad and glasses of wine and it was pounds they automatically include a service fee on your dine in service which is an optional tip only they don t tell you that it s in there or that it s optional we would never stay in this hotel again very poorly designed if you are a businessman and don t need to see in the mirror then it might work for you
