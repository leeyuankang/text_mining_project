wait time to check in arrived and has to wait to check in only out of checkin desks were available room was okay though quite basic for in mayfair very clean not much character in the hotel seemed quite cold mayfair kitchen was amazing and staff very professional and friendly however the ending was extremely disappointing i reported my necklace from my wedding day and my bracelet missing and i m still waiting for a call back it s appalling both extremely sentimental pieces of jewellery and not one member of staff cares or has taken ownership of this and i have spoken to the duty manager house keeping and fitness centre i m extremely upset about this experience and wouldn t expect this level of service from any hotel but certainly not the mayfair hotel in london worse of all we were staying there as it was our wedding anniversary and i left without my wedding jewellery
