i booked a superior twin room but were shown to a beautiful double on arrival after i contacted reception we were moved to a twin which did not compare to the double at all the twin was very small and was overlooking a set of stairs it was the only twin left apparently but it did leave rather a bad taste after seeing the lovely double
