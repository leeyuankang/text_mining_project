on arrival we were shown to our room there was no view from the window except some steel staircase also the rim of the leather bed had splashes of some liquid around it the lady from reception who showed us our room said it was a really busy weekend however i don t think that should jeopardise our stay especially as we paid the same price as every other customer at the hotel the pillows were too thick gave me earache
