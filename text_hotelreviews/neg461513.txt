poor electronic communications in relation to our request to ensure our bookings for consecutive stays were coordinated resulting with us being locked out of our room on the second day this request was also made to staff when we booked in having to wait over minutes for the room key because they claimed payment for the stay was out standing despite payment being made at the time of booking in december the overall experience spoiled what should have been a relaxing stay
