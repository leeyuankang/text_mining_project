very disappointed with our room it was very dated and needed a revamp messed up my booking and had to be moved also as i and my elderly grandmother were about to go to sleep a maid came walking in to our room without knocking or warning for no apparent reason after calling down to reception to speak to the manger they told me he would call me back after waiting minutes i called down and said that i was going to sleep in the morning the manager came up and spoke to us absolutely unacceptable for this caliber of hotel i also left my phone charger behind and didn t realise until i got home i called up and they told me they would have a look and call me back and that was days ago and i m still waiting i will not be coming back
