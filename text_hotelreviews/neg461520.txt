booked two twin rooms as ladies traveling together booking com had twins as an option which we selected however these were not available when we checked in and was told there was no alternative to the double rooms after some discussion one twin was found and later that evening another later room was found and we moved with a z bed not ideal as we are all adults and not young but i appreciate they made the effort to accommodate us
