for a supposedly luxury hotel the deluxe room at the mayfair was sorely lacking a very bare minimum in furnishing no separate sitting room very small bathroom with only a small shower tub combination instead of a spacious place to bathe and groom the bathroom was reminiscent of a cheap motel in the usa the closets are a strange lineup of doors that have to be closed in order to open another etc the view was the wall of another building did we get a discount room instead of the deluxe by mistake also the upstairs restaurant was being renovated to what looks like an open contemporary space not the rich warm feel of the former space
