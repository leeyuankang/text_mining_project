really poor photos do not represent the rooms at all poor mismatched furniture worn carpets and a complete lack of warmth in the rooms coupled with the rioting footballers blowing gas canisters and jumping on their beds next door and above us the hotel bar full of wannabes hookers and security guards who look like they ve just returned from the ukrainian front this place is appalling why i decided to freestyle the booking and not just stick with the langham or the rosewood i ll never know don t bother
