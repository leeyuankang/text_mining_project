from my room window i could clearly look into the offices opposite so i had to keep the curtains closed all the time not a nice experience breakfast was decent good variety of food fruits and yogurt of good quality fresh pressed juice was also appreciated all in all not bad but nothing fancy however when staying days and there is no diverse everyday the same menu it does get a bit mangy and last but not least the rate was overpriced considering the room provided
