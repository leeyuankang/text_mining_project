the room wasn t ready until even though we checked in at the staff were extremely rude the complaint of the room not being ready was dealt with very poorly we had to wait minutes to be seated for breakfast although there where empty tables the service wasn t explained to us and the hot food was cold then the complimentary breakfast and drinks where charged to our room and had issues trying to remove them from our bill
