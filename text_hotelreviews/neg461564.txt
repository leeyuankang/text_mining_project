the location it used to be a quite quiet area very upmarket and exclusive but things have changed in central london and what really frustrated us about this visit was the level of very late night street noise i was woken in the early hours by music from a nearby bar club and then the roar of supercars going up and down the street this hasn t happened before maybe we should be more specific with our room location by the way the bar we got back to the hotel late afternoon and headed to the bar for cocktails for four drinks they were good for that money you would expect it but the experience was slightly tainted by the fact that there were a group of male overseas guests who thought it was the done thing to scream at the top of their voices like they owned the place maybe they did i don t know there were huge doorman in the bar and on the doors at in the afternoon this is a five star hotel in mayfair they were unobtrusive we never felt uncomfortable in any way but it sort of says something about the place that they have to do this that said it didn t ruin the experience in anyway maybe its just how it is in central london hotels these days maybe our tastes are changing but for the cost of the room it wasn t outstanding its good but not exceptional on this visit there s a lot of choice in london these days and the mayfair does a lot of things well but for our wedding anniversary trip i just had that feeling it could ve been so much better for the money we spent if we had tried somewhere else
