there is a bar within the hotel also having a separate entrance from the street when i tried to enter the place at new year s eve using the entrance from within the hotel i had my hand stamped i have never been treated in such a disrespectful manner at any hotel and i am shocked that the management of the hotel tolerates such actions from the staff of their bar absolutely unacceptable and i consider it as a good reason to avoid this establishment in the future
