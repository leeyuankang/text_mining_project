firstly a drunk woman kept us awake by banging on our door during part of the night secondly whilst relaxing myself in the bath and partner asleep a staff member knocked at our door we couldn t answer so i d thought they d understand well they didn t and they let themselves in with my partner running to door the member of staff kept saying he needed to check what we used in the mini bar otherwise he s charge us i found this totally uncalled for and rude and its sad that little things like this didn t make it as perfect as it could have been
