check in was a little chaotic and our room was not ready at they did upgrade us to a duplex suite but this was very dark and we did not really like the room at all the bed was very low and not very comfy and the bathroom is downstairs there is a fire door from the bedroom into the hall upstairs nor good with a sleepwalking husband had to barricade it to avoid him locking himself out i the hallway i speak from experience
