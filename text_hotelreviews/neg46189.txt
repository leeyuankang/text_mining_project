the room was tiny the ac blew directly into my head the windows were also too close to the bed the blind was ripped the room was dirty the bathroom sink was blocked the wrong room service menu was in the room which delayed my order as i had to wait for delivery of a new menu there are only two hot vegetarian options on the menu the fire alarm went off at i called reception to ask what i should do they said they were investigating and would call me back they did not the ac meant i woke up with a head cold and was feeling ill and missed breakfast i asked for another room but was told the hotel was full i had just come back from paris so was tired and had to do some urgent work i did not have time to follow up on my complaints my stay was awful and made me unwell this is not a four star property and i will not be staying here again i would like a refund i was asked for my email address but have not yet heard back from the hotel they fobbed me off with a free stay for a special occasion but feel i have been fobbed off
