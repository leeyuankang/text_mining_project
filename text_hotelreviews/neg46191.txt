the staff was slow and not very helpful at checkin and first insisted we had a reservation for a single room only eventually they admitted we had booked a double but the room and the bed were so tiny it might as well have been a single the room was way too hot and the thermostat did not work properly there was a very long corridor with many steps to the room which made it rather difficult with heavy luggage
