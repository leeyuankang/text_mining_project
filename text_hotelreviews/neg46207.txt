on check in i found a used piece of dental floss on my floor but otherwise the place was spotless i had an early morning check out and as i walked down the stairs to the reception i noticed a drunk man asleep on the stairs i alerted staff immediately and they got rid of him you d have to swipe your card key to access the area where the rooms are so he wouldn t have gotten in there but more staff awareness of who comes and goes would be good internet went down on last day but a call to staff helped me out very good service
