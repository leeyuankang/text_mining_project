the parking was very expensive at and very very tight i asked the receptionist about the street parking as there were lots of places she said that she didn t know anything about street parking we didn t want to get fined so we parked in the tiny hotel car park the room was really small the hotel is on the floor and the receptionist had to close the reception to go with you to move your car we were asked to move our car so that other guests could get out although they had the keys i wouldn t stay there again
