booking com website was very misleading this is a small pension on floors of a large building reception is via a lift to the second floor entry to hotel is through a heavy iron gate at street level the terrace in the photos is a very narrow area of chairs just outside the dining room our room had chair table on adjoining balcony note there are no flower boxes as in the website photos due to the website photos and the only room the website indicated was available i was disappointed with the room provided as it was not what i was expecting for the price no tea coffee making facility in the room
