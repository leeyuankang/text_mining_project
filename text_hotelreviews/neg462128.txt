the hotel is based on the second floor in what looks like a regular residencial property so no standard hotel entrance from outside ater taking a lift to the floor where the hotel is based there is closed door to the hotel and we had to ring a few times before somebody opened the door a few minutes later slightly odd arrangement if you got used to regular hotels
