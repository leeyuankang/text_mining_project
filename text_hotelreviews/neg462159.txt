we encountered very serious problems during our stay here regarding the water supply on the first morning there was no hot water in any of the rooms when we contacted reception we were given a variety of excuses only to find out at the end of that day the boiler was broken another morning one of the couple got up to no cold water and this was only found out when attempting to use the shower and getting really hot water as unbeknown to them the cold water supply was unavailable causing a serious scalding risk which was only narrowly averted by quickly getting out of the shower and slipping on the tiles in the process even with this quick action some minor scalding did occur which really needed some immediate attention with cold water but there was none available surely there should be some thermostatic control on the showers due to the lack of cold water their toilet could not be flushed so they had to fill a waste bin and use that to flush it apparantly the problem with the lack of cold water affected all the rooms to the front of the hotel we in the rooms at the rear did have cold water but again an issue with the hot water being only tepid this time the other friends in our party of six were given a room that was specified disabled which they are not however how this room was very spartan with an univiting appearance and it had no curtains at the window only nets and when they asked for some curtains were told it would be looked into by housekeeping but it never was as our friends like to sleep in a dark room this again was very unacceptable also how it could be classed for a disabled person we do not know as to get into the shower you had to negotiate a high step how it could have been in the same price bracket as the other two of our rooms we do not know these problems severely affected all six of us and spoilt our holiday considarably
