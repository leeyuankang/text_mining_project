the single bed room was extremely small literally had a single bed in it which i haven t encountered in a hotel ever before really there is no cable tv the wifiis spotty at best the front desk hidden away on the second floor has a bit of an off putting attitude no way to control the temperature in the room with staff being unwilling to provide the remote for the ac or any way to heat the room if it s too cool it s too cool the room was very stuffy upon arrival so i opened the window to the central courtyard which lowered the room temperature to very cool levels fresh air but too cold and no way to heat it the room itself has a view onto a featureless inner courtyard no way to see the sky and really nothing to see so keep the curtains closed
