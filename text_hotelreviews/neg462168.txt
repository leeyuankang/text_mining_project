when we arrive it was totally what we didn t expect for a standard room with twin beds we travelled europe for the last few years and everywhere we been a twin beds is considered twin beds made into one king size not a two twin cots and a room a size of a closet for five days that cost use can we did talked with the main desk and the next morning we were moved into a superior room with twin beds made into a king size and very uncomfortable i think the mattresses were as old as the hotel but the room was much bigger
