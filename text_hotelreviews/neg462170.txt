the entrance is confusing and and overall hotel has a creepy feel to it when i arrived one of the lifts was dis functional wouldn t open unless the button was pressed a few times my room was small very low light and ventilation one of the nights the main door would not open after hours pm onwards i was lucky since there was a couple coming in at the same time the third night the lights would not work in my room when complained the receptionist came looking for a key card wall slot there was none in my room and she was surprised then she went looking for the electricity boards and we had to spend mins working out how to open the hidden electricity trip switch normally i would have complained to the manager but after reading the reputation he has i didn t bother
