in the days we stayed there they only made the bed and gave us clean old towels floor and bath were never cleaned i made a mistake when i did the booking min later i tried to cancel but they absolutely refuse to cancel way overpriced breakfast is set up in the lobby not good no space to move it was a terrible experience
