staff is friendly and tries to be friendly but can really use some skills training in customer service no tea at breakfast you have to ask for cooked water yourself several times on the and morning morning we just received warm water which was not cooked also there are more people in the hotel than seating available for breakfast staff bothered us in the room up till times during the stay guests need some privacy one night we forgot to buy bread so we asked for just two slices offered to pay as the stores where closed it was late and it was a national holiday staff refused which made it awkward especially since we where told friendly to just ask if we needed something food it was not like we were asking for much
