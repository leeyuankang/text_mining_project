we got a very small room more like a closet we upgraded to a very nice room but late in the evening persons other guests entered our room while we were sleeping and we had locked the door how is that possible the next day we didn t have towels and than they phoned us to tell our taxi was arrived but we didn t ask for a taxi the reception is very unorganized
