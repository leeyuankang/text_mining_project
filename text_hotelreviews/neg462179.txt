the pictures and the description are terribly misleading as we walked into the building we realized that hotel was located on two floors the pictures featured on booking com do not match at all the conditions we met there everything in the bedroom was falling apart the bathroom was ancient and had fungus on the wall the taps were extremely unpractical to use the hotel has no restaurant only a generous breakfast with very low quality food the manager treated his employees very bad yelling at them in front of guests which was quite embarrassing to watch it is a big surprise that this accommodation is awarded stars because it doesn t have half of the things that a star hotel should offer big disappointment after staying at a very nice star hotel in ljubljana that is also part of best western hotels
