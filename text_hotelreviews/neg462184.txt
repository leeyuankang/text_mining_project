this hotel has one big problem the director is very unprofessional and really unkind with my family i had to stay twice in this hotel the first time we found long black hairs in the bathroom the second one we had problems with one bed sofa when i talked about these things with the director he said he do not wanna talk with the guests he used not just scream but also use very low style expressions as shut up i travelled all over the world and this is the first time i met a director who talk and act in this shame way
