the very first pic for this hotel on booking com shows a big elegant looking building which we thought to be the hotel when in fact it is the building across the street kind of misleading as we thought we were paying to stay in that nice building the hotel is in sort of an apartment block and ou have to take the elevator up to the floor for reception also they won t give to the controller to the air conditioner unless you request it even then i was told we didn t need it as it gets cool in the evenings and we could leave our windows open i said it was too noisy with traffic and sirens but they replied that no it wasn t and it was quite quiet i felt like they were playing the jedi mind trick on me these aren t the droids you re looking for
