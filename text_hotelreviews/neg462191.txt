definitely not a star hotel was expecting a luxurious and comfy hotel with good location and good service non of my expectations were fulfilled so disappointing place first of all there was unfriendly and unheplfull staff the place is shabby so not were comfortable and did t feel like spending any extra time in the hotel our room was old and nothing i had expected from the pictures of the hotel rooms i have nothing good to say about the hotel
