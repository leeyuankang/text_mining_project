not sure where to start i booked this hotel for one night as i was traveling from the airport the next day firstly there is no lobby at the hotel you come in from the sidewalk into a scary foyer you know you are in the right place because of the signs and labels but other than that you have to figure out the spiral old stairways or elevator when you think you have come to the right place you ring a buzzer and hopefully someone clicks the door open for you then you are in i had requested an early check in only an hour because of my genius status on booking com which i learned was nothing or meant nothing in order to check in earlier i had the opportunity to upgrade to a superior room for euros waste of time and money the room was small and simple floor carpets and rugs very dirty not happy at all with the place
