the staff s attitude i asked nicely for changing a double room to a twin room the manager made me felt like i shouldn t ask if i don t want to pay extra plus the key card didn t work every single day i had to go down to the reception to change a new card every night at the night the manager said you must have done something to the card i kept my card in my wallet in my backpack fyi the bed was terrible when someone moved another person would be bounced didn t sleep well for nights
