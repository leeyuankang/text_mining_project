the hotel tried to transfer my booking to a sister hotel on the morning of my journey to vienna due to technical difficulties i refused due to the location of the alternative hotel and the short notice they relented the hotel is housed on two floors of a building in which the entrance foyer and stairs are cold and bleak but once you have entered the hotel entrance the surroundings are much more inviting
