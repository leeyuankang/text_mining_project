my wife missed the choice other hotels often offer of shampoo and toiletries we had a simple squeezy soap dispenser i would describe the room we had as adequate not large but then we were late booking so missed any choices the morning scrambled and boiled eggs with the cooked breakfast were excellent but an omelet or fried egg choice would have improved the offering the rest of the buffet was choice
