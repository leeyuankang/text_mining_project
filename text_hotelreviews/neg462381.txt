we paid euro night for superior double room incl breakfast for ppl even though it is high category room hence the price we believe we didn t get value for money i e the room was regular size overlooking the inner courtyard two beds connected together nothing special so we believe such room should be priced lower few problems in the room you could hear loud music into the night until coming from club adjacent to the hotel we slept with open window since room was hot for each of the nights we stayed over weekend very annoying pillows were very uncomfortable we got new pillows after we asked no kettle for tea coffee although we saw in other rooms we got after we asked no body lotion in the bath we believe is basic for such hotel and room category we got after we asked but were told it is exceptional
