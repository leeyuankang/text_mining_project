well here goes the room was so uncomfortably hot and we stayed in feb so it was winter it was a sauna therefore felt i was sleeping in degree heat we did not turn off the air conditioning after day and still unconfortably hot for a winter stay then they have these green soap dispensers in the shower and by the basin empty and no soap cakes no little shampoo or conditioner either hubby and i raided the cleaners trolley in the morning after day realising this was intentional and not a mistake
