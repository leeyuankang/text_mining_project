it s the oldest hotel in vienna so expect all the great but also the not so nice things it brings so there are a few issues that one could expect in an old hotel some parts of the hotel had a not so nice smell and the doors have classic keys so you must remember to lock the door when leaving the room also some furniture parts look a bit worn
