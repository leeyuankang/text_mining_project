the bed was very uncomfortable we traveled as a couple and we had two twin beds pushed together and two separate twin duvets the staff were also extremely rude and didn t help with any suggestions of the city also the maids did not clean the bathroom properly they didn t clean the toilet replenish the toilet paper or replenish the tissue box i was actually pretty appalled that it had a star rating as service was star the location was also min walk from center which in the winter feels like a lot
