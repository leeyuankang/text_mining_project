cleaness can be improved the breakfast is nothing special also on the first day there was no place to sit in the restaurant so they asked me to sit at the bar in another room i accepted only to find out that the journey from the bar to the table were the food was placed was quite a long walk when i asked the waiter who attended at the desk to get me some help to carry the food he seemed very annoyed not only did i do him a favour he did not do anything to help
