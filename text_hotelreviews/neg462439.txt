we booked a room months in advance and specified that we wanted two twin beds when we arrived they said they had no rooms with twin beds available at this stage it was too late for us to change hotels eventually we were given a single room with an uncomfortably small sofa bed to be fair we were given a small discount when we complained at check out the bottom line however is that we did not get the room we booked and the bed issue is hardly a minor detail they could have at least mailed us in advance so we could have booked another hotel
