the only negative was the heat the controls on the wall do nothing and are not connected and there was a hidden radiator behind the headboard of the bed below the window causing a far too hot room opening the window helped but it was only when i worked out how to turn the radiator off lift out the metal grill on the window ledge reach inside and find a knob to turn wash hands as it is absolutely filthy and dusty in there
