not a major issue but being used to uk indoor temperatures usually quite low we felt a bit stuffy inside the hotel particularly at night it is possible to switch off the heating in the room but the rest of the hotel was so warm that it didn t really cool off we had to open the windows at night which was fine as we had a courtyard room so no noise from the road
