me and my boyfriend had a nice meal it was a new experience for me the meat i had it was very cool inside and i thought it was undercooked but apprently how it should be i got up that night with stomach cramps and had a bad stomach for days my boyfriend was also a little off i have never been ill before from food and usually have a pretty hard stomach we told reception and all he said was that he hadnt heard anyone else be ill on checking out nothing was said either bit of a dissapointment for me at the standard of hotel with the customer relations that no one offered us any water for the room it was a sunday all supermarkets were shut and had to pay for a small water or how we were also we were told our room had a courtyard view when arrived we had the view of a side street not a complaint im just saying advertisement wasnt correct
