the bed in our room caused us severe back pains bad they were split beds for a double size and were so old that they might never have been changed bad we filled out a survey and do not know if the hotel owners got it on a very noisy corner too too much heat in the room made the room stuffy and in the cold weather the only thing to alter the temp was to open the double glazed windows and let in the cold night air bad no ramp up meant that the luggage bags had to be carried up to the rooms on level bad
