the room it was too small for two people we had to request another chair the bathroom was bijou the bed was very comfortable we are senior citizens this was our third visit as we love the hotel staff we requested a room near lift as my husband has limited mobility we were offered another room but we had unpacked this was too much hassle as it was only for one night we think that the price we paid for this was over priced
