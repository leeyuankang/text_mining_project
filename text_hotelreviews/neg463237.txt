the only problem i had was that there was a lot of noise on the street outside the hotel and the noise carried all the way to the floor where i was there was first someone playing a saxophone and then someone else playing loud music till well after midnight it disturbed my sleep even though everything was great in the hotel the noise outside is the reason why i probably won t be staying at this hotel another time
