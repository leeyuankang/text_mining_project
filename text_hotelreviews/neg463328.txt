at in the morning the cleaner let themselves into our room no knocking before entering and we had to yell no don t come in to stop them from fully entering the room the manager at reception defended the cleaner and told us that the cleaner had knocked and waited a moment before entering he also told me that i can use the extra lock to lock the door so no one can enter a very disappointing ending to out time in london
