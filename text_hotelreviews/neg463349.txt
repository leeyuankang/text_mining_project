there were many issues with my reservation and room initially and my card key consistently did not work the staff also packed my bag and moved my room when i had specifically said to wait until i could return and pack myself staff was great in solving the issues and very friendly however many of them shouldn t have happened to begin with also i the hotel seems more geared toward tourists than business travelers
