just want to caution travellers that if you book non cancellation the hotel will still charge you some properties will waive the penalty depending on your circumstances or perhaps charge you for one night but the amba will charge you for the entire stay they do have the right to do that based on policy however i had hoped for better customer service given i was unable to travel they did offer to allow me to book a room in the next months if i booked within a week of cancelling however i will not be able to travel for at least months ideally a refund would have been the best option or at least a partial refund
