only two things to note checkin took an extraordinarily long time no line just whatever they were doing i am unsure after hours travel we were so weary and just wanted to quickly get to our room also due to the busy location convenient and the adjacent train station lots of litter crowds and sales stalls just outside the front door do not make a good impression coming and going probably not within the hotel s reach to improve that lack of ambiance but it is significantly trashier than anyplace else we have stayed in london
