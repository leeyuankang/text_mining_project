the wi fi in the rooms isn t great it isn t easy to have conference calls for work on skype the bathroom needs a better shower curtain room was flooded after a shower the location is very central in one of the more attractive parts of the inner city but the street the hotel is located on is pretty unattractive boring walk to the main road but that isn t the hotel s fault
