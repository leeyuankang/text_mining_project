the bar in the hotel while offering off drinks because of the building work opposite could not manage a whiskey with ginger ale and when we asked for gin and tonic the bar man took out bitter lemon not tonic however we learned later that he was a new member of staff it would be nice to have a lounge to sit in that is not the main reception area
