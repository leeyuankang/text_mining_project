there s construction going on on the opposite side of the hotel but we didn t experience any noise problem during our stay no ventilation in either the toilet or bathroom the ac was a bit warm i didn t want to open the windows as the street noise may disturb our sleep the pillows were my biggest complaint they were way too flat and fluffy to my liking very flimsy door card signage it kept flying away whenever we open close the doors most of the interesting channels were not available in english language
