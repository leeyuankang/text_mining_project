construction across the road not the hotels fault but there was a little noise in our room facing the construction side upon check in we were told if it was too noisy we could move but it was mostly in the morning when we were getting up anyway so it wasn t an issue there isn t anything much to dislike the only thing i wasn t a fan of is you have to ask for coffee at breakfast it isn t self serve but it isn t a big deal i would stay here again if i went back to vienna
