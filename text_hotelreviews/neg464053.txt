we drove to vienna and when we checked in the woman on front desk directed us to the parking lot she said it was easy just a few streets away but as it turned out she sent us via closed off streets so we sat in bumper to bumper traffic for an hour in a strange city trying to find a new route and ended up back at the hotel and grabbed one of the porters and he knew the roads were closed and took us a different way in mins she never even looked up as we walked past saw her a couple more times waiting for an apology but no also the room was quite noisy with a building being demolished across the road and for some reason they have taken the doors off the bathroom and toilet and replaced them with glass doors maybe they thought it would modernise the room but it takes away any sound proofing and privacy no hot water on the last day other guests reported the same thing to reception
