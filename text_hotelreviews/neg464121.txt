the individual duvets i was not surprised because i had seen this in previews reviews but really single duvets in a double bed not a good choice and went against comfort even though the bed itself was good the welcome could have been more enthusiastic the taxi to the airport while it s not the hotel s fault the driver did not seem familiar with the bus station and was not able to communicate in english not a flaw in itself but necessary for what we needed to accomplish resulting in him leaving me past the station entrance where i could not see it and telling me that he did not know where i should go i was about meters from the entrance but the moment was very stressful until i discovered that as no one in the street was able to help either it would be helpful if when calling a taxi the hotel could ensure that either the driver can communicate with the passenger or knows where the tourist needs to go for his travel they changed to nicer thicker round soap on the last day of my stay the previous super thin tablets were inconvenient
