didn t like how blunt the receptionist was she didn t smile or greet us politely seemed as if we weren t people but just a name on the computer screen she wasn t rude just quite blunt would have ordered room service for food but on the menu it seemed overly priced for a burger and chips hated the view could see land fills rubbish everywhere the fridge didn t work didn t get cold at all spent some time trying to work it out gave up in the end just got some ice from the bar despite how the room was already at a discounted rate it was still a bit too much for our personal preference
