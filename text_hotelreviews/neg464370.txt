restaurant was closed on the saturday evening i guess due to staff shortage i had to sit in the bar area to eat although this wasn t necessarily the fault of the hotel but there were alot of young football supporters putting their feet on tables and making alot of noise right next to me when eating my evening dinner and my morning breakfast the staff available seemed really busy but were still pleasant need more staff to cope at weekends
