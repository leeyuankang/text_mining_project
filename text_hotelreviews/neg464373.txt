for a supposed star hotel or indeed any hotel i find it amazing that as an older woman with a lot of luggage when i requested a porter to help i was told that we don t have porters you will have to do it yourself had it not been for a very helpful taxi driver i would have been stranded outside the hotel in the rain after my insisting someone did help me and the same scenario was repeated as i was leaving eventually someone with a very bad grace helped me get luggage into the lobby but i was left to get it all outside myself i will never stay here again i had to point out the sign in the lobby which said if anyone needed assistance they would be happy to help blatantly not true dreadful customer service and when i checked in i was not told anything just handed a key card and dismissed
