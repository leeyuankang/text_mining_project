we arrived at pm but were not going to be able to return from work in london to collect the car the following day until pm there seemed to be some confusion at reception about the car parking charge it is a bit disappointing to have to pay a car parking charge at all if however having spent nearly for two rooms b b the car parking charge for hours did not afford some flexibility i would have been really disappointed one of the main reasons for choosing the hotel was the shuttle bus to and from the local underground station the drivers were lovely but the service was only available from and from therefore i had two minute long walks to and from brent cross station i would probably have stayed there anyway but the absence of this service from to should have been clear at booking
