how can parking be charged when the hotel is in a remote place relative to central london there isn t a way to get to the hotel except by car and the land is huge so parking isn t usually a problem and isn t charged at such hotel locations furthermore i stayed here before and wasn t charged previously so it seems like it s charge on discretion wasn t happy about this you re a traveller s hotel as you re located on the so how can you expect people to avoid having their cars just man up and reflect the parking in your prices rather than charging it as extra once the guest arrives or make sure it s clear when the customer is booking that he ll pay extra for parking
