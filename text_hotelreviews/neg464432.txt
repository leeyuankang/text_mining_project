bar staff and dining room staff including chef need training on customer service service very poor food cold and some of it poorly cooked i was part of a group so they seem to be totally confused if they get a few orders for food together food was also cold for breakfast overall hotel fine but definitely would not recommend it as a place to eat even for bar food
