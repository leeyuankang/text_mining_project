the evening meal was awful i chose lasagne which was very dry as there was no sauce in between the layers of pasta this was an executive room for which i paid more than the previous room we stayed in last june on floor i would therefore have expected it to be bigger but in actual fact the cheaper room from our previous stay had far more room so this was very disappointing given that i d taken up the option to upgrade this time
