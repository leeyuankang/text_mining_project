my room had hairs all over the bath and the floor the bed had hairs on and was not very neat the teabags in the tea and coffee facilities were opened so i didn t trust those luckily there s a costa minutes away also i got charged twice on my card the authorisation when you first put your card in to book doesn t get used for the actual payment they took a further payment from me so my bank account was wiped out the phone in the room didn t work the tv barely worked properly the breakfast was mediocre price was included in our room so i wouldn t complain too much but the food quality is not the greatest our key stopped working the night before we were due to check out so had to get a new one issued and also the bath and shower were diabolical the bath took minutes to fill up to a decent level and the shower went so slow and not very powerful at all
