when i arrived around the member of staff at the desk was unfriendly and his manner was abrupt he wasn t able to manage a smile or a good evening i am unsure if that was his general way but it wasn t what you expect when checking into a well known hotel chain after travelling from far and a long day i used to work for a hotel chain and we were advised to be welcoming and accommodating when i entered my room there was such an awful smell possibly drains or possibly someone had used the bathroom before i checked in this was quite off putting and made the room seem less clean
