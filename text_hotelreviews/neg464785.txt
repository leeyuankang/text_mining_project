the hotel did not come up to my expectations of a star at all it was definitely not worth the price i paid i had to pay an extra on my credit card i was told it was if i required any extras even if i didn t want any extras i still had to pay the i had no choice it was mandatory no mention of that one before i booked on checking out i was told that the would be back in my bank account by the end of the week not at all happy with this
