my teenage daughter and i were given a room with a double bed i thought i had asked for singles but i wasn t too fussed when i found out i was given a double since we are both petite for people with a huge suitcase each the room was relatively small one of us spread out luggage on the floor and the other had to spread our suitcase out on their writing table behind the bed head i think the room we were given would have been perfect for the business traveler carrying a small suitcase
