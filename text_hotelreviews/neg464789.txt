customer service our first room didn t get a wifi signal and some staff flatly didn t care or showed no interest in remeding the issue it was only after raising the issue with a manager was some action belatedly taken second room had wifi but a partially broken a c it pumped out cold air but did so with a loud high pitch drone unless we turned it to a low setting to offset the drone again staff didn t seem to care that much
