the only problem we had with the entire visit was with the booking we booked this in january to stay in may and only found out the week prior that there was some problem with our booking and the payment had neither been taken or contact made with us to advise so we were advised that there was some problem between booking com and the hotel where the card details had not been transferred across a simple call as soon as this was discovered would have resolved this had to call the hotel several times and then booking com in the evening to resolve when finally resolving the problem with the hotel i did request a room on a high floor and thought this was little to ask by way of making good but we were allocated floor so not even this was done as a gesture both parties blaming one another
