we were told on arrival that alcohol was not served at this hotel this was not advertised on their site also we found out at breakfast that they did not serve any pork products we are extremely angry that we were not informed of this as we would not have booked this hotel the bed was awful and far to soft the air con did not work and the shower flooded the bathroom
