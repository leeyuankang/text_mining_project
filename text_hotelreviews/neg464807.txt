we paid for one night with no breakfast i know it is in the heart of london but still quite pricey especially as they also could not offer any parking facilities the reception is small and the staff although pleasant were very matter of fact there is no alcohol served on the premises which is unfortunate as it would have been nice to relax in the comfy chairs with a glass of wine
