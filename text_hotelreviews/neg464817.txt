just one for me catastrophic problem was that in most of the rooms the windows are hermetically sealed with no opening i find it impossible to sleep in a room without access to fresh air even if somewhat diesel laden once i discovered this was the case i found out that there were a few rooms with terraces which of course did have opening french doors so i had to pay for an emergency upgrade at extra this for me of course reduced the value for money as i had to pay more for access to fresh air a commodity i view as standard
