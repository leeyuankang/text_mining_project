the walls were pretty thin and i felt like the room wasn t safely closed because there was a gap between the doors and the recess at night we could hear someone being really loud in the hallway i didn t like the decoration of the lobby but that s just a preference the decorative pillows and duvets weren t clean and even had some stains on them in the area around the hotel there wasn t that much to do but there is an outside gallery where you can find food stalls and take a look at the tower bridge we asked for a second duvet because the ones that the give you are quite thin
