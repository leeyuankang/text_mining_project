new management has imposed a no alcohol policy obviously many of us think it is nice to have a glass of wine with a good meal although i can perfectly well survive without and certainly respect other peoples different preferences on this however being imposed a hotel management s biases is something that i am not expecting or happy with at all and never experienced before this feature of the hotel s policy is also not advertised on the webpage or its profile so it appear management realize it could impact bookings on the contrary the webpage advertise it is located in the heart of ever evolving bermondsey with its thriving restaurant bar and club scene the omission of this policy on the webpage makes people like me feel there is a not full and honest transparency of the hotel s profile i have stayed many times at this hotel before but this new policy will make me reconsider returning i would suggest management consider changing it back and respectfully let their guests decide for themselves their approach to alcohol
