the bed was very uncomfortable felt like the mattress was very old room very noisy couldn t work out if it was the aircon or not room also small decor is tired and in need of some maintenance staff were not particularly welcoming or helpful food choices for breakfast are odd for the price i would not recommend there s a premier inn just around the corner and i think i ll just stay there next time
