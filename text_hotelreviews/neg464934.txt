we checked in quite late around but having advised the hotel of this earlier that evening and were a little baffled at their disinterested attitude approach to check in we were pretty much left to find our check in sheet and chase up staff who were sitting around although the rooms are very modern labelling them superior when they re actually very small and the smallest room on offer is a little misleading there s also no storage space which means manouvering your way around the room with stuff everywhere is a little difficult
