the reception told us that breakfast is until but when we came waiters have tolds us that on that day is just until that we have to hurry up grab the food that we want because they will close everthing they repeated this message over and over again in a quite rude way so the relaxing moment of having breakfast was completly gone and plus this was a misunderstanding between reception and breakfast staff
