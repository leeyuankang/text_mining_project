for parking by day for the circumstance that there is no other possibilty to parc the car even not for me as a leg handicapped person this is to be informed directly and clear before booking for me such surprises make me angry the hotel is quite far from the center so it is already nescessary to take much more time and cost to come and go there should be a free or very cheap parking for hotel guests
