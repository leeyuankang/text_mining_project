they musn t have had occupants in our room for quite a while as there was dust on the bathroom countertops and the bathroom itself smelt of mildew disuse not very pleasant at all we did not bother with a room change request as we were only staying one night and had already unpacked there is nothing to do or eat in the local area so you have to plan around being in the main city hub for entertainment and food
