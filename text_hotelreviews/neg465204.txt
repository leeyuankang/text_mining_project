getting the right information from the front desk staff was not easy i called and inquired about how to get from the wein train station to the hotel and was told i could only get to the hotel via taxi which in fact was not the case also getting a map of vienna that was readable was non existent as the map i recieved was so hard to read it made my trip harder and more time consuming very frustrating when you have only a few days to explore
