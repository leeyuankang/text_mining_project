breakfast items were very poorly maintained on my last breakfast there were no scrambled eggs and the container had obviously not been filled for some time as the edges were covered with dry and congealed egg the orange juice was awful not really juice the bacon was just dry and almost inedible i like crispy bacon but this was a step too far the many yoghurts were not labelled so you had no idea what you were eating actually there were hardly any labels for the food
