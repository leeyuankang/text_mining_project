location is not that good if you are not planning to watch a football match in camp nou stadium the closest metro is m which is not bad but to arrive the city centre it will take you at least minutes and the metro close at midnight during weekdays so if you are planning to stay late you have to consider a taxi or night bus i booked for a superior room since i have a kid years old but when i arrived i was given a small standard room then i complained to the staff and they gave a superior room with a sofa bed which was fair enough for us to get rest and relaxed the bed is slippery because it has wheels
