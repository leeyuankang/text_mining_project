the location is perfect for camp nou and an fc barcelona game although it might be noisy and chaotic on game days i assume because there were no games while i stayed otherwise it is far from the centre but public transportation is very good accessible and takes you there in minutes walk metro the main attractions in barcelona are far from each other anyway so there is no perfect location
