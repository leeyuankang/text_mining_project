although we paid pounds a night the staff refused to give us a kettle so we could boil water nightly for formula milk for our baby we had to keep going down to the restaurant to get it on our last night the restaurant had closed by the time we got back and the receptionist was reluctant to get up and boil some water for us it would be better if the hotel could employ some more helpful staff
