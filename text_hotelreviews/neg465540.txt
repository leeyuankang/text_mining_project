the hotel reserves the whole price of the stay on the credit card already during check in plus eur extra which will be released later but you have to take that into account when booking this hotel also when you stay in the club room you have to take note that a breakfast in the main building is not included in the price i did not know that but the hotel did not luckily charge us as we used it only once
