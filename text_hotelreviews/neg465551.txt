the swimming pool was freezing and very uninviting we had been looking forward to a relaxing swim in between sightseeing disappointing the cleaning of the room was very poor the television came as a package very strange it did not work and there was no signal therefore no movies the music in the main lobby was to loud and intrusive in the reception area difficult to communicate
