no tea coffee or kettle in the room the air con wasn t the best and the shower was a bit rubbish in the bathroom also i felt they are a bit stingy with the free toiletries silly but i would use the soap in the shower and rather than give us another one for washing our hands they would move it back to the soap dish every day all very silly little things all the above didnt really matter what did upset me was how rude the lady in the swimming pool area was i asked for a towel and it was a huge inconvenience to her to simply pass me a towel i didnt dare ask for a robe as well also there is a big sign saying remove swimwear in the sauna that is disgusting
