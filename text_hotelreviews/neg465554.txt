although if my german understands it there was a notice in the locker room of the health suite about nudity in the mixed sauna being forbidden there were still fully naked men hogging the sauna and no one was supervising this although there were two receptionists on duty this is something which frequently goes on in european hotels and needs to be monitored at the hotel in berlin recently this was happening at o clock in the afternoon while women and a year old female child were around which upset the child it is selfish behaviour and hotels need to have segregated saunas as they always do in finland and separate times for using the plunge pools
