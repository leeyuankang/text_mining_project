on arrival we were told that we could not have a twin club room for our whole stay as our booking com reservation was only a preference and not guaranteed i have booked many rooms and have never had this problem before this was very disappointing given that i had also messaged the hotel in advance about our room preference the reservation staff tried hard to fix our problem and about an hour after check in they visited us with the welcome news that we could remain in the same room for the duration of our stay they also brought drinks cake and fruit i have no idea how they sorted this but would like to say thank you very much
