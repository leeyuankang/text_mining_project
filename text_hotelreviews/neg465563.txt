overall i would stay here again there are some minor issues but you should focus on the positive comments i ve made it s a shame the negative ones get top billing on this site the swimming pool and changing facilities are small and the pool was a bit too chilly for me the temperature control in our room was non existent other than for warming up which was unfortunate because it was degrees outside and certainly not needed even after turning off the heating and opening the windows the room was very warm they did offer us a fan though in the summer they will have changed the air conditioning over to cool so it was really only a problem because of a hot week in spring
