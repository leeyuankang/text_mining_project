ridiculously the hotel charges for wifi and the sum itself is ridiculous this can be avoided by becoming a marriott member something that is free but then you have to go through a process that proves to be a painful rigmarole on a mobile the internet connection itself then proved to be poor there was nothing in the fridge bar and no complementary water tea coffee or kettle in the room for a visitor like myself who is used to travelling in central asia china and poorer parts of central europe where all of this is par for the course this is pretty frustrating you wonder what other problems will emerge i avoided finding out other disappointments by taking my custom elsewhere and not having the very expensive breakfast for example slippers are another thing that would be standard for a moderate hotel in kazakhstan or china for example but weren t available here but that s just a minor issue overall the entrance to the hotel looks nice but the decor in the long corridors ages the establishment the staff were pleasant but fell short on some pretty standard questions
