it was really unpleasant the fact that we went there and were informed that the visa card we gave wasn t for payment so we had to pay on the spot then i gave my visa two time and was declined while it worked just fine in other places as a result i paid cash and they still hold half amount of the payment that i have already paid by cash in my card until this day without me knowing something that i think i saw in the reviews from someone else as well before we went so checking their visas could save them and the tourists lots of trouble i found that to be quite a mistake because i tried to get that money out on the last day of my holidays and couldn t not even knowing why good thing i had more cash with me overall it was a very good stay we used the pool the pool and the rooms were good just a bit smaller than the pictures i didn t try the sauna but the fact that they closed the facilities at it was a big plus
