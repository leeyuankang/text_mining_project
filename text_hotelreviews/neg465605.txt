everyday there was a collection of dirty bottles and glasses in the passage outside our room clearly this is where house keeping felt it was appropriate to store dirty things i personally cannot see it as acceptable to store dirty crockery in the passage in the evenings there were groups of students playing guitar and doing singsongs in the public areas this is very much a hostel rather than a hotel please see then photos for the typical appearance of the passage outside our room
