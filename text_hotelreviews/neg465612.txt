the staff on check in the guy was ok but when i asked if we had single beds or a double he was not polite on his reply on check out the woman was moody and no smile and when i was asked if i enjoyed my stay i said it was ok small ok then she looked shocked and started to be more friendly i had little time to tell her so here it is regardless of it being in vienna there is no excuse for unfriendliness especially at reception or in any service industry anywhere in the world on saturday evening it took minutes to be served drink drink at one point there were staff members behind a tiny bar area not doing much there were not that many drinks poured to customers either they were disorganized there was no system and because of this they served who ever was in front of them which was not always the first person waiting i have to say that even though i had a long wait they bar staff were friendly when they did serve for this standard of hotel i expect friendly staff at reception and bar service quicker than that
