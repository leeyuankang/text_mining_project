we travelled with friends asked for rooms on the same floor with big beds upon arrival we realized they didn t keep us the rooms requested the receptionist did his very best to give us very nice rooms although no on the same floor to bad there is no wifi in the rooms i do think paying for this service is unnecessary other then that we had a great time
