when we got to our room it was smelling very strongly of cigarettes even though it s forbidden to smoke in the whole hotel and the receptionist warned us that there are smoke detectors it is not clearly stated that the standard studio doesn t have open able windows and it also doesn t have a door between the room proper and the kitchen beware the superior studio has both but is more expensive worth it in our opinion
