i landed there on a public holiday after a hr flight it would have been handy to keep at least some milk biscuits and water in the fridge i could not buy anything due to the public holiday expected to have laundry facilities in the apartment night was hot without aircon i was told that it works only when it gets further hotter street noise was excessive on opening windows no service cleaning for days
