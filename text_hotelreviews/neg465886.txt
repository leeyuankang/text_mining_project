while our room was very clean the rugs in the hallway were stained and the floors in the elevators needed to be mopped one other negative consideration that some may want to take into account is the fact that i was informed by email two days after departing the hotel that my accor account it s a hotels loyalty program that includes adagio and mecure hotels among others would not be credited with any points for our day stay at adagio because i had booked it through a third party booking com the adagio staff apparently were not aware of that policy and had assured me that my account would be credited but accor disagreed and denied the credit that s not the hotel s fault but anyone who travels extensively and likes to accumulate loyalty points as my wife and i do should be aware of that accor policy for adagio mercure and other hotels
