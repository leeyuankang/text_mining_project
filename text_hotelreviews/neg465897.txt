air conditioner is very weak and does not keep the room cool at all we even switched rooms thinking it wasn t working but there was no difference in the new room also there was no housekeeping service we had to ask for fresh towels and toilet paper they were handed to me at the front desk carrying my toilet paper to my room was a bit awkward we were expected to take out our own trash too we stayed for six nights i would not have booked the room if i knew the bathroom would never be cleaned our sheets would never be changed and i would have to ask for toilet paper and fresh towels there are washing machines available for washing your laundry but only one dryer unfortunately the night we did laundry another gentleman was also washing we started washing our clothes at pm and because he kept using the dryer and feeding it more coins we were not able to dry our clothes until am we sat and waited patiently for him to finish it wasn t his fault there was only one dryer disappointing since it is a four star hotel
