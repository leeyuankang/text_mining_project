we were informed by reception that we could not open any windows in the category of room we had booked but could upgrade at an extra cost knowing that the rooms had air conditioning we did not think it was necessary however the room was very stuffy and the air conditioning was totally ineffective the pillows were very hard and uncomfortable we were somewhat surprised that for a night stay we were not entitled to any cleaning or any change of towels or bed linen goodness surely after nights towels etc could be changed
