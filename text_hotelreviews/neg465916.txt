the hot water system is dangerous and unsafe we had to be careful when having a warm shower when someone else in apartment or in the building used cold water it would instantly get extremely hot no exaggeration but it was like pouring boiling water on yourself just be careful with children babies and have it on a cooler temperature also the fold down bed in studio apartment is quite heavy with no pneumatic assist to stop it from crashing down on top of you my husband opened it but for the elderly anyone suffering from a back injury etc i would recommend asking for assistance from the helpful reception team we enjoyed our stay here and still highly recommend it
