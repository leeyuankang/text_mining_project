internet is a weird beast of the hotel hotel has options free and a payable one the option that is free i have chosen that one works but sometimes can be very very slow for the tasks that i have it was not a problem but if a high speed wi fi is a must then the guest should consider a payable option and it is not a bad or good fact it is an apart hotel but if the guest is still wants to have a breakfast then be prepared for the quite mediocre thing but again if you choose an apart hotel then you are choosing it because of the possibility to have the breakfast of your choice
