we booked standard apartment room and were very disappointed that all rooms of this type have windows which could not be opened air condition system didn t work properly so it was really taugh to maintain comfortable temperature inside we asked staff at reception to air the room but they didn t manage to do it eighter it was too late or they didn t have a key to open the window another don t like apartment wasn t cleaned throughout the whole week we stayed there according to the contract they clean if you stay days if longer not
