previous guests have already mentioned how the cleaning service is really weird at this hotel you get cleaning if you stay nights but don t get any cleaning at all if you stay night we knew about it so it wasn t really a problem the only thing that really bothered us is the fact the window could not be opened and we didn t know about it beforehand
