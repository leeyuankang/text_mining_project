the staff was not very helpful we asked them to book an airport taxi but they made a mistake about the time so they had to rebook it nevertheless the taxi didnt come at the desigated time at the end when we asked them to call the taxi driver they said the taxi was coming but didnt give us any license no of the taxi we waited for half an hour and end up got into a taxi randomly
