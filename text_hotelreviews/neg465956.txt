the room could have been cleaner rests of pear in the sink water stains on toilet lid there could have been two chairs in the apartment for two persons although we got a second one upon request the pillows in the bed were too hard and too high althoug the personnel was not unfriendly they could have been friendlier the apartment could have been bigger the hairdryer is not suited for persons with long hair the aparment does not get cleaned if you stay between and days the place was too expensive for what it offered we expected more from a star hotel we would classify it as max star
