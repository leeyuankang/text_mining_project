the only detail that i thing is very important to improve is the floor carpets they where stain and dirty smell bad and did feel clean for guest s that are allergic to mold or fungus or has asma its not save place to stay my wife had to take medication during are stay since it activated an allergic reaction i would suggest cleaning all carpets or installing new floors that would make the hotel adagio a star hotel beside that issue it was great place to stay
