the bathroom was not really clean upon arrival there were hairs in the shower from a previous resident not nice to look at also upon entering the room for the first time it was stuffy and i had the feeling it had not been aired for a few days remember barcelona has a hot climate after the cleaning staff arrived the next morning the room was up to scratch
