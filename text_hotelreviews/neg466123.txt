we didn t like the fact that there were no hooks on the doors or somewhere to hang a jacket that wasn t in the wardrobe you don t always want to put your outerwear on your clean clothes there also needed to be more lights and the shower needed to be much more powerful our room was for people single beds one pillow a piece and a sofa double bed in another room no duvet on the sofa however the room wasn t particularly cold so this wasn t an issue where the room was supposed to be a living room it was a little difficult to open the balcony door some manoeuvring was required
