i wish it was an adult only hotel it is a little small to allow for the noise of screaming children through the thinnhotel walls and ruining the calm mellow music on the roof top bar pool it was be in my opinion if there were no children for this reason we will not stay here again and instead look for an adults only hotel in the same area
