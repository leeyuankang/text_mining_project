switched to a room with a window to the street as the rooms with window facing the courtyard were quite dark booking com did not clearly differentiate between the rooms the hotel was great but that issues with booking com they also charged me a higher rate than i initially selected when i checked out were unacceptable i ll book with the hotel directly next time
