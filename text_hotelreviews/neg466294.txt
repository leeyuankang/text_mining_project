room stank of sewage when we complained they sent a cleaner who sprayed some air freshener which masked the smell for twenty minutes we asked to see the hotel manager the next day but he wasn t available we were told he would get in touch with us as soon as he was available nobody got in touch and we had to suffer the sewage smell for two nights this took the shine off what would have been a great break in a lovely hotel
