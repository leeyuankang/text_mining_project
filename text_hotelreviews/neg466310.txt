not much that we didn t like the rooms are small but who cares really the walls are thin so you can hear people walking on the wood floors this didn t bother us though breakfast seemed very expensive but they had a pretty good selection i would just walk down the street and grab a quick bite for euro instead of euro though roof deck bar was just ok but glad they had it it s worth grabbing a drink one night the hotel staff is very friendly and helpful but you will get better deals in the bus shows etc if you just order online
