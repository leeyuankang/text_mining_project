extremely disappointed by points firstly i asked many week in advance for a bottle of sparkling wine to be delivered to my room on arrival as this was my wedding anniversary this was confirmed nothing arrived the day before i asked whether we could check in early this was confirmed albeit subject to availability however when we arrived there was basically no chance as the hotel was fully booked which must have been known the day before we were even told to come back at even though the official check in time was the main point here is that i asked very specific questions and both were confirmed in particular the bottle of wine to the room i could have asked but the moment had passed and given the cost of your hotel i really should not have to unfortunately its the small things that make the biggest difference and im afraid this has left me very unlikely to book with you again
