very very loud with thin walls could literally hear what tv show was on in next room could hear conversations bad but worst was the ac you have to put your room key in a slot by the door to turn on the ac when you leave obviously you have to take the key out and so the ac is always off when you aren t in the room so when it s degrees outside as it was when we were there it is boiling hot when you walk back in the room from being out sightseeing and takes a couple of hours to cool off and even after several hours we figured out how to stick a piece of paper in the slot so the air would run while we went out it was still barely cool at all would never use this hotel again for that reason along with the noise bed was adequate but sheets felt like sandpaper had to climb a foot tub wall to get into the shower cheap toiletries makeup mirror loose and no washcloths not a great experience to say the least
