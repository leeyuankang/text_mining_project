we visited in june and rooftop with pool was closing at o clock basically they were closing the door with access to roof top or pool even though it was still not dark so you could not see the view take fresh air or smoke after that rooms quit big but no balconies never tried breakfast because thought it was very expensive euros each besides that plenty of bakeries around in the area where you could enjoy coffee and breakfast where you could pay much less
