the lobby has a bar but it is not open at any time that seems to be a big mistake for a four star hotel also at the pool area you got to bring up something to drink sunbeds and the whole area looks unfortunately out of shape however lots of new clean towels are placed here for use instead of bringing up towels from your room that was in fact very nice
