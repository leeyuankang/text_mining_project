room facility said patio but this was mis information as the said room window opened onto an internal non accessible patio just facing rooms on the opposite side following my complaint i see that there is now now mention of patio also the room description said wheelchair accessible but the bathroom was in no way wheelchair accessible and a wall along inside the bath meant one had to get into the bath to access the taps which themselves had no makings to say which was shower rain shower hot or cold
