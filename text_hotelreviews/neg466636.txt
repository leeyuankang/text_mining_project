the ordinary rooms are not suitable for disabled persons they gave us a smaller room with no physical barrier in the bathroom but the room itself was too small and we had paid a larger sum of money they refused to give any refunding for this downgrading quite disappointing absolutely not recommended if you are a person with special needs
