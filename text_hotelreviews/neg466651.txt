no air conditioning despite the rooms being sweltering too noisy in the night to have windows open as located on a main road walls are very thin and you can constantly hear other people including every time they go to the bathroom i appreciate it wasn t the most expensive room in the hotel but for you expect tea and coffee making facilities very disappointed
