room furniture was old very old fashioned and lacked personality bed was small and not very comfortable bathroom was smelly as there was no ventilation we didn t have breakfast there as it was too expensive for what was offered and not appealing at all overall the stay was ok but certainly way too expensive for the value offered definitely not stars
