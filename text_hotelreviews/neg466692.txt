uncomy bed very loud maids waking us up at no view run down street came back to my room to find one trainer missing asked staff if maids had picked it up with sheets or something in error was accused of lying asked to have my bags searched and made to look like a criminal at the front desk offered no compensation and wouldn t take any responsibility i even offered them to keep the other trainer to prove i wasn t lying after kicking up a fuss they phoned the laundry service and half hour later i was told just as i suspected they had the trainer treated so poorly before this i was gobsmacked
