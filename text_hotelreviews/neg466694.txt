this hotel is exceptionally noisey sound from the corridors transmits into the rooms you can hear the other rooms tvs clearly in your room and conversations etc from other rooms out of nights we had undisturbed nights sleep beds are not comfy there is no room service or restaurant other than the breakfast service the local restaurants are not of a good quality all but one of the reception staff we encountered were unhelpful and unfriendly some renovation work was also occurring during our stay so paint and varnish fumes seeped through the air vents
