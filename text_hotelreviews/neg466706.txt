internet connection is awful in this day and age internet shouldn t be this bad bedding was dirty had spots of blood and goodness knows what ever on it pool on the roof is nice however no one supervises the area and there was lots of empty glass bottles and cans of alcohol everywhere especially the hot tub no bedside sockets in fact there is only one free socket to plug your items into which is beside the window i e cant have phone plugged in to charge this socket is used for the provided kettle so you have to unplug this and hope your room mate doesn t want to use things like hair straighteners etc
