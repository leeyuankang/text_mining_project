the bar was a bit disappointing and felt a bit tucked away on the floor it was quite small with seating relatively pokey or on large communal tables dj music admittedly after dinner was unappealing and surprising in a hotel the hotel deserves a large stylish bar with comfortable seating in a great setting and a bit of wow factor instead it feels like a small rather average nightclub the impressive glazed atrium is probably tricky space to make work but the present set up doesn t feel like it quite does it the lounge with uncomfortable low backed sofas gave the feel of an airport transit lounge whilst sharing the atrium area was the bistro but we didn t eat there it felt a little soul less for what was an expensive menu uncomfortable pillows were flat soft and too large insufficient support stiff neck guaranteed every morning
