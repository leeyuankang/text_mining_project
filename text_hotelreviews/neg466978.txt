there was an incident with our check in our room was delivered with two and half hours delay the duty manager apologized for this situation and offered us a discount on first night as well as s late check out at our room was with an inside view to the lobby which makes it a bit noisy in addition one of the windows has only a night curtain without a day curtain therefore people from the lobby can see you this is a bit annoying if you want some privacy
