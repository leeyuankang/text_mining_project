the duplex room was beautiful but awkward with kids we were adult a teen and a child and the room configuration did not work well for us it had a sofa downstairs that made into a toddler size bed the only bathroom was upstairs with the king bed and no extra space the only closet was very small and downstairs basically unusable with the bed and bath up a steep staircase
