the tech can get pretty confusing as there are a huge number of light switches many without labels the two story rooms can get pretty uncomfortable especially when packing and unpacking some ceiling lights hang so low that i was hitting my head extremely frequently but then we moved a table underneath it the shower in my first room deluxe duplex smelled like excrement three housekeepers and an engineer couldn t fix it so we were upgraded to the royal duplex the manager who moved us forgot to mention that a prior guest had ripped off the closet door so the closet had no door this was made more annoying by the motion sensing light that turned on whenever anyone walked within a few feet of the closet at least one wake up call never came to make up for the issues the hotel begrudgingly gave us complimentary breakfast and a massage each for me and my wife but the manager who gave those to us made it very clear that he was unhappy about doing so he was extremely gruff and rude although another manager that we dealt with was an absolute pleasure every time we spoke as we were checking out the nice manager let us know that apparently the hotel had reserved us a pretty amazing suite for our last night but the front desk had neglected to tell us about this so we did not get a chance to try that suite while the trip had some negatives the nice manager fantastic breakfast staff ideal location and stunning building will bring us back to conservatorium i am hoping that all of this was simply our bad luck and not indicative of the hotel s general quality
