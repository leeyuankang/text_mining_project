when i arrived in the hotel at the staff informed me that there was a leakage on one of the floors and they were unable to rent out the room they rebooked me to nh in amsterdam city centre it s oke if you have a problem that s out of your control but then it s all about how you manage this problem they failed miserably with this they didn t call me which would have been much better as i just came from the centre i got a smaller room in the city centre and i lost hour of sleep they barely apologised for the inconvenience apart from this the bed is terrible it s like sleeping on a rock the shower barely worked and the breakfast is bad value for money wouldn t recommend to stay here
