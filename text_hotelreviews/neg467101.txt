i booked four rooms at this hotel for my family and friends i was extremely disappointed with the level of service they provided because of the incompetent staff we wasted a lot of time with issues that were rather trivial in general the communication with the staff was very poor almost every request e g extra bed faulty cooling system needed a follow up because either the staff forgot to address it or it wasn t completely understood even when i asked for the manager of the hotel the staff at the desk seemed puzzled and somewhat reluctant to my request prior to my family arrival i double checked with the hotel that everything was paid and in good order however on the evening of their arrival my family had to wait hour to check in late in the evening because of the incompetent staff who couldn t find the evidence of my payment
