there was a mix up when i added the breakfast at the time of check in i was chased up by the lady at the breakfast counter to pay up for my breakfast i believe that you only charge the guest when they check out as a result i was late for my business appointment and had to rush to get there in time i think this hotel needs to have a process setup in place where there is proper communication between the reception and the breakfast counter however i was offered a day s complimentary breakfast this is a good gesture from the reception staff manager but it doesn t change the stress i had to go through to get to my business appointment in time i would think twice before staying here again i would definitely stay at the crowne plaza which doesn t have anyone charging you before you check out
