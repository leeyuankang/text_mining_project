i know the nh hotel chain very well but this tone was a total surprise for me check in was fast and ok but later on i had two rooms in order to accomodate my kids their room had issues heater didn t work out and shower was not working properly either both issues were communicated to the front desk but only the shower was repaired i asked twice for the heater to be serviced but no feedback and no repair either in front of this hotel there are many parking lots but be careful they look to be property from hotel but they are not i got a fine euros from the city i am sure lot of people do the same mistake i saw other cars with same yellow paper on the windshield why don t they ask if you know about that in the check in
