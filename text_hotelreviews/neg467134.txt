the fact that we could not make changes to the reservation approx days before arrival was a problem the shower head fell on me twice whilst in the shower it s quite a big one i have a big blue bruise on my shoulder i phoned reception to order food and the the receptionist advised us to order out this bill was euro s for two pizzas after i only wanted to order something from the hotel menu for euro we did have burgers on another day at the hotel and they forgot to put our eggs on the burgers the staff was very friendly but i wont recommend this property its to expensive for what it is there as no usb charge point in the rooms the blinds are old and we could not block all the light off as we tried to sleep during the day coming from an american flight and was exhausted we were charged euro s per person city tax per day we asked for a wake up call that never happened this was one of my many stays in amsterdam but it was the one i liked the least i think the hotel needs work on the rooms and they need to rethink the cost of their menus and service dieter eric emma were lovely staff though
