the air conditioning was not cooling enough and when we complained we were provided with a small table fan as they were unable to lower the temperature below c the housekeeping in the room was appalling stayed here for nights but everyday noticed that only the beds were done and the garbage bins cleared nothing else besides this don t think the room was even being dusted or swept as bits of paper n dust used to be lying around in the room the same bed linen was used even though it had stains on it toilet bowls were not cleaned it s a long walk min to the metro and another min by metro to the central station if traveling by tram it s even longer
