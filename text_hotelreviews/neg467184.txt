very limited food choice the food arrived very late limited choice on breakfast as well the free wifi is extremely pathetic if at all you are able to connect still the pages would take ages to load definitely not recommend this hotel to anyone i had also asked for a late checkout which was confirmed by the hotel staff checkin but on my last day the hotel staff got into an argument with me asking to check out early since i had a year old baby with me this was extremely annoying further the attitude of the hotel staff is extremely bad
