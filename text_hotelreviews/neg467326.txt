the entrance of the hotel at night can be a bit weird it s just in front of a night club and even thought i was there during work days i saw people drinking around the entrance every night also even thought i emphasized that i wanted a quiet room i was given a room just in front of the elevator which is also near the room where the cleaners have the trolleys etc which made me have to sleep with ear plugs because of the noise i didn t asked for a change of room scared that i would get a lower floor and hear people on the street also not ideal if you are on a business trip since there is only a very low tiny table to work so i had to work on the bed lastly you had to introduce the details of the wifi every time you wanted to connect to it which made it very annoying when working all these things probably don t matter if you are going on a leisure trip for which i totally recommend it
