this is a lovely hotel but i did have a few issues during the stay nothing major but something for the hotel to think about the aircon is poor it was extremely hot on the first day of my stay but i just couldn t get the room to cool down and had to have a cold shower on the second night i was kept awake until due to loud music outside either from the bar or club downstairs the wifi code was not easily accessible i had a busy schedule so didn t manage to ask reception for it until near the end of my stay i think it should be provided in the hotel room or given at check in without the guest having to ask for it
