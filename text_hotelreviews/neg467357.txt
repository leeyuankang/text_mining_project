we stayed for nights it was a bit confusing for us on the complimentary bottle water first night there was a bottle of water available second night there was none and third night a free bottle of water was available again the same for the bed side chocolate at evening turn down service we did not get the chocolate on our first night but there were chocolates on second night and then we did not get any on the third night it is small issue though it did not affect our liking of this hotel
