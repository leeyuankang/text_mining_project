there was only one drawer in the bedroom for shirts etc we mentioned this to reception and were told that other people had made the same comment also on the two days we were there our room was not cleaned until pm we were told this was because the hotel has a big turnover and priority is given to cleaning the rooms of those leaving first apart from this we really liked the hotel and would stay there again
