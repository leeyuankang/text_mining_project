breakfast look amazing but not good eggs and croissant are really not i arrived very early and asked for an early check in the blond girl who welcome me at the front desk was really nice and speak a good french i was the first people where leaving and leaving very early this day i ve waited for hours and still no room for me finally i left for a walk and came at one hour before schedule check in and asked and they replied still no room available just started to be nervous people where still checking out that means one hour late from the normal time which is noon usually i got nervous and in mns she found a room by surprise i think the policy of the hotel is not giving rooms when you arrive early which on my opinion and not really good i told them i think this is the first time it happened to me on a business trip i am aware check in is not before pm but when you can arrange something for a client as a service it s good won t come back to this hotel just like my room and the staff
