they made me loose a reservation for nights and for two rooms as i requested to waive my cancellation and cut an amount of some nights but not the full payment as i had to cancell the reservation the same day they were not helpful and hold to their policy as an excuse rather than making an exception to satisfy a guest who already been there on another reservation they are not flexible as any other hotel my advice is be careful when dealing with such hotels
