how is it possible that such a hotel doesn t provide any gym facilities at all calling the reception they told me there is no gym in the hotel but there is a gym across the street and the hotel has an agreement in place for their guests what she didn t tell me was that the hotel guest needs to pay eur for a single day admission which is even more expensive than what you pay in zurich for a single day admission without any hotel
