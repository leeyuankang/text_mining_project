the first night we ate on the rooftop terrace restaurant no complaints about the food but the service left a lot to be desired we were in no hurry but over half an hour for desert from a chiller cabinet yes it had been forgotten not that many people there but so disorganised the waiter even had to ask us what we had to eat then made the bill at the table
