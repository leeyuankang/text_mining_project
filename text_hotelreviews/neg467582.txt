wifi was terrible and spotty do not rely on it also the lack of normal hangers makes my stay terrible as i came during fashion week the hangers were cheap and bulky took up too much spaces and not efficient also there was no steamer and tooth brush and tooth paste in the room also the bellman just stood there at the door never helped me to bring the luggages out to the taxi only until i was leaving the hotel
