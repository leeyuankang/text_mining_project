my kids were given an accessible room but as they didn t mind i didn t bother to request a change but is unusual both rooms mine and the kids had no views and i thought it s a bit cheeky from them but again i just thought this time i ll enjoy myself with what i got which i did this hotel is highly recommended even with what i said
