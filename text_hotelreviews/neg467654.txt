the staff need major customers service training specialy the reception the hotel is not next to the duomo as the name suggests its a minutes walk there is no parking at the hotel you have to park the car and pick up the car yourself in a near by carage which is always crowded with non english speaking staff if you plan to bring your car this is not the hotel for you with this rate i could have stayed in another and better hotel
