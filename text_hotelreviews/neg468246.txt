the hotels traditional restaurant recommendation solferino may look traditional but food was average tourists everything is charged as an extra and prices at least triple of that in a really good restaurant in milan felt completely ripped off and sent to a tourist trap i am happy to pay but was not worth the money at all spent half the price the night before at a top milan restaurant with wine will not go to restaurant solferino again
