the team at the concierge desk have no experience it was our first time in milano and we ended having a not very good time because the concierges suggestions were not good for example we needed a sim for the mobile and the concierge sent us to an inaccurate address and after we finally arrived she forgot to tell us that we needed a passport the restaurants they sent us were not good and other day we ended walking in a street where there was nothing to see
