i had a room on floor just below the breakfast restaurant the noice was so loud from chairs moving around and people walking and talking that it was impossible to sleep once the breakfast was open furthermore we were not informed that the aircondition didnt work in our room so i had to call the reception am in the night at which point the room was very hot after calling the reception times some one finally picked up and just turned on the air condition and then hung however we still couldn t adjust the temperature meaning that we both got a cold it seemed to me that you knew that the aircon was turned off and didn t work but didn t bother to tell us last but not least i was locked in the bathroom for minutes just before leaving the hotel and going to the airport the effort from the personel to get me out wasnt exactly very impressive had to kick the door open after the minutes in order to catch my flight that resulted in a injured foot for the following days the keys were removed from the other bathroom stalls including the girls which go me thinking that this had been a problem before all this would have been okay if i was simply informed and at least compensated in some way but there was only a sorry
