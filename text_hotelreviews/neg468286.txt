i requested a no smoking bedroom but told there were none as all the bedrooms were available for smokers to use i refused the first room allocated as it smelled of stale smoke the second was better although when the room got hot it was noticeable if your a non smoker it is off putting air condition was not controllable in the room hence the room temperature was much too hot for the weather conditions outside and unable to leave a window open because of the mosquitos i was very disappointed that was not addressed during the five days we were there and the handy man leaving a sugar sachet in the card slot to keep the air con working was not a fix of a problem it did nothing to reduce the temperature making sleeping uncomfortable and from what we saw at reception it actually appeared to be controlled centrally rather than by guests in their room
