the shower fell off the wall on top of me we reported it to front desk who got the maintenance man to fix it whilst we were out the outside of the hotel is shabby as others have remarked we asked for early check in but only got in at a quarter to so had to go and rest on park benches and cafes for a few hours after an all night flight next time i will choose hotel that will guarantee me an early checkin
