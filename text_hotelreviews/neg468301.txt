closing the room doors is very loud because the doors have outside a doorknob so many guests pop the doors when they leave the room the wifi is bad for this reason the hotel is not recommendable my sleep pants disapeared because the room service put it together with the bedsheets when they cleaned the room the hotel management gave me no compensation for this inconvenience this is an absolutely do not for a service company
