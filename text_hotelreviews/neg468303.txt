i paid through booking com with the company s credit card which of course i didn t have with me at the time of my staying although the payment was authorised by the managing director by email sent directly to their back office they didn t want to process the payment with that card so i had to provide them with my personal credit card which is something i never do when i stay at hotel on business trips as usually everything is paid upfront
