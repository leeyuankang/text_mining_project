the employee that did our check in was rude he didn t seemed welcoming at all and didn t replied our questions which is a shame seeing the rest of the team all of them pretty helpful and lovely on top of that he never offered us the welcome drink we were supposed to have according to the booking reservation we missed some clean towels the second day although we did leave the dirty ones on the floor the smell of humidity and the lack of ventilation were a bit too present it would be lovely to have more light warmer as well
