there was nothing about the service or comfort that i could criticise the only thing i would say as a recommendation to the hotel would be to refurbish the outside artwork the lights on the garden wall they are really cool but need to be revived the inside of the hotel is spotlessly clean and in great condition so they are just lacking that last bit of attention to detail by looking after the outside
