the balcony made me sad the only reason you d go out there was to smoke not to enjoy some time outside the wifi isn t very good it doesn t work in the lobby once you get to your room you have to enter in a username password on a daily basis very annoying the room was tiny and the bathrobes towels have seen better days elevator is incredibly slow
