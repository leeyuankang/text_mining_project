have to say this has been the worst experience that i ve ever had in milan given that i travel to milan every year on business and have stayed in many star hotel this rates poorly the reason been that i booked a non smoking room and then was move to a smaller room which clearly was for one person on complaining my complaints were not directed to someone in charge and if they were then the person in question didn t have the gumption or the manners to speak to me directly shocking my request was that i was not prepared to move again and that the rate should be reduced this was to no avail so you have my vote of and i will make sure this is heard
