not satisfied with the overall customer service reception staff was not too kind nor welcoming the hotel does not provide conditioner and body lotion and i was advised from the staff to go to the nearest supermarket to buy some also they are not able to guarantee the use of an iron when you need it this is not what you expect from a hotel in this price range and not suitable for people travelling on business
