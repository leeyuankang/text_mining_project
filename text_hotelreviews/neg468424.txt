really really noisy our rooms were out to the street over the hotel entrance with an unacceptable noise level even with windows closed there are a couple of bars opposite and people outside until well past in the morning delivery to the supermarket across the street and trash collection starting at am on top of that our rooms floor were directly under the breakfast room so lots of noise from above from early on as well the climat control in the rooms did not work and it was hot and stuffy a real problem when one cannot open the window
