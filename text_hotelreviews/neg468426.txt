we stayed at the hotel for nights for the first day they offer us room the room was very old dirty the shower was very weak and the water went to all different directions unable to wash your hair nothing like you see from the photos definitely not what a star hotel would offer the next morning we requested to change the room they moved us to a room on the second floor the room was bright and clean we paid the same amount of money for both nights we have no idea why the rooms can be so different
