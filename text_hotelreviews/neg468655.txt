room service food does not have many options when we got to our hotel after waiting in customs for hours after a hour flight we just wanted to relax in our room and not have to go explore for a restaurant the food was eh but it fixed our hunger problem this was not a problem for us though we were not in barcelona to eat hotel food there is a mcdonalds across the street around the corner that would have been a better option just for the night but again this was not a problem we were just hungry and needed something so their food sufficed
