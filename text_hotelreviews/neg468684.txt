location is not the best ok commuting by metro to e g plaza catalunya but by walking it s a bit far standard rooms have basically no windows or they face the next building just a few meters away so opening the curtains is not an option difficult to adjust water temperature in the shower and you can hear everything from the hallway so bring earplugs feels expensive for what you get
