misleading room type while booking booked interior room which means windows face the wall but for the hotel apparently interior room means super tiny bed not suited for people tried to change but staff was very rude especially the old guy on the reception did not sleep the whole night as the bed is too small and it s too hot to breath in the room the next day apparently there were no free rooms changed for last nights and were charged extra it s not the first time staying in this hotel plus recommended to our friends will never go back
