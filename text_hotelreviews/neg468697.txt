when we arrived the receptionist was not very helpful even though one of us speaks fluent spanish we d reserved breakfast and a parking place and the receptionist struggled to give us either on the other hand when we checked out on sunday the great receptionist was able to refund us the breakfast we missed due to sleeping too late she also made sure we could leave our car in the parking for a bit longer
