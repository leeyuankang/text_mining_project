i like this hotel and always stay there as it is a good business hotel and close to where i work but i was truly disappointed last time i stayed at balmoral we had booked three different rooms for me and my colleagues and arrived at am they wanted us to pay an extra amount for early check in knowing that the rooms were already available as a regular customer i will reconsider staying there from now on
