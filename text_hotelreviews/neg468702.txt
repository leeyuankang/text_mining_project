we were quite disappointed with our stay at this hotel the room was not as it was pictured on this website the original room we were given had torn sheets and was much smaller than described then upon moving rooms to a bigger bed and room it left much to be desired from a four star establishment the cleaning lady walked in our room at despite a do not disturb sign and honestly for the price it was a disappointment with lacking facilities such as a sauna and steam room that weren t turned on and a sun deck with only a few deck chairs i was really disappointed because it was the low point of a great trip
