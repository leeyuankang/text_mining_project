the rooms are very outdated and badly in need of a refurb the tv didn t work had no channels and no instructions but i didn t ask as i wasn t that bothered the first night my air con was so noisy i couldn t sleep they couldn t fix it that night so i went and spoke to reception again in the morning and they sent a maintenance man who repaired it quickly it was disappointing that this fault had not been checked and repaired as part of the room inspection cleaning work before i checked in no discount was offered despite my complaint about being unable to sleep and they could not give me another room instead overall this hotel is cheap for a star and there are very good reasons for that i wanted the central location so i got that but for the same money you can get much nicer a bit further from the duomo i think
