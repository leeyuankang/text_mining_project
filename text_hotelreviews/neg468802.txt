from the second we arrived until we left we were made to feel completely unwelcome by the front desk staff and the bellhop at one point the bellhop literally tossed our luggage into our room the problems started when we arrived by car it was not clear where we should park to unload the car when i ask the front desk clerk a tall grey white hair man he gruffly stated that was the bellhop s job then in a loud voice said something in italian and a portly bellhop appeared from wherever he was hiding the bellhop was clearly not happy to be disturbed with the bellhop providing instruction in italian i don t speak italian i manage to pull the car onto the sidewalk in front of the hotel to unload the bellhop was clearly not happy with the amount of luggage i do admit we packed way more then needed but the bellhop did manage to begrudging get us to our room and i gave him a generous tip the room was very stuffy and humid but we could hear the air conditioning was on so decide to allow it to cool the room while we walked around milan for a few hours returning to the room it was just as stuffy and humid using a chair i placed my hand in front of the air conditioning exhaust it was blowing very little air and what air there was was warm because i know we would not be able to sleep in such a stuffy room i reported the problem to the front clerk the tall white hair fellow he gruffly said they would look into the problem while we were at dinner i strongly suspected from his attitude that the problem with the air conditioner was already known after returning from dinner i stopped by the front desk before going to the room the white hair fellow informed me that they had looked into the problem and hopefully the air conditioner was working better we returned to the room to find it was just as stuffy and humid i again placed my hand in front of the exhaust to discover there was no change
