the staff at the restaurant was no friendly we arrived at without any booking and the restaurant was full we asked if we could come back later we were willing to wait even untill if needed but the staff did not seem to want us arriving so late and preferred to tell us that they did not know when they would have a free table the restaurant was supposed to close at the room are very poorly isolated there was a lot of noise from the street especially with the tram passing right in front of the hotel the wifi was extremely weak in the room or non existent
