the check in was not welcoming the staff at reception seemed to be very casual without even a decent smile on face this gives a very uncomfortable feeling the hotel was absolutely old fashioned the room was very small to even accommodate a single person with his luggage looked like a hostel bunk bed there is no complimentary water bottles provided no coffee maker in the room the hair dryer in the bathroom is years old and with old technology hence doesn t serve the purpose while i was checking out i asked for a taxi and told i have a train to take to the airport the guy called for a taxi and told me it will be here in minutes and then he disappeared and neither did the taxi arrived he turns out after minutes and i miss my train there were also signs of racism towards asians with a very rude behaviour not worth the money you pay
