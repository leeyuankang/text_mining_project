the most unfriendly staff on reception i ever met in hotels although guys on breakfasts were very nice ruined the experience completely no wifi in rooms but it works on corridor when i gently asked to fix it i was recommended to use whatever works since it s free and won t get any better soundproofing isn t good to we heard tv from the nearby room
