the worst most unprofessional reception front desk customer service i ve experienced in my entire life the receptionist on march had zero customer service skills and shouldn t be in the hospitality business after driving for five hours we reached the hotel s area and all the streets were blocked because of the pope s visit being not from milan we called to hotel for advice on how to get to the hotel the moment i asked the question of how to reach the hotel the front desk only told one thing with his voiced raised on us i dont know i explained that we just need recommendations of where to stay because it seems like we are in a residential area and we don t want to waste our time their specially that we only had the weekend to explore milan he wouldn t even let me finish a sentence and would interrupt me with i don t know how else can i explain to you that i don t know as i don t want to engage in such unprofessional conversation i said thank you and then he hung up we ended up parking somewhere and had lunch at alice restaurant when we asked the waiter at alice about the road blocks she explained to us the roads that are close told us the open roads and gave us recommendations the point is the waiter at alice was able to give information no excuse for a supposedly star hotel reception staff i m pretty sure it wasn t the first time the pope visited milan if this hotel is okay with a receptionist who do not have people skills management should at least write them down a script or give them a brochure they can read to their customers when in situations like that the unprofessional behavior didn t end there when i checked in this receptionist was stone cold and already irritated when i asked the question on where we can park the way talked to me was so condescending that it sounded like he had years of grudge against him
