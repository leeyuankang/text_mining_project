one of the most important criteria for a hotel is to provide a quiet environment for a good nights sleep unfortunately i was in a room on the floor facing the main road the noise from the street was intrusive so much that i thought the windows were open i could hear peoples conversations outside they should invest in soundproofing their windows also as a business traveler i travel light and need to refresh a shirt and suit trousers they do not have an iron and ironing board in the room or available at reception they charge for ironing services which for an overnight stay is asking too much since the turnaround time ie i need to refresh my shirt in the morning before breakfast but they can not provide the service to do this
