we booked two rooms in my son s room air conditioning did not work properly i have read in the trip advisor reviews that other people also had similar problems reception staff looked slightly aloof there were no tea facilities in the single room i also did not like their peculiar system of light switches where i pressed a room service instead of lights by mistake
