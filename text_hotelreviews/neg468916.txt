when i got to the hotel at pm i checked in and got my room number but when i got to the room it was not ready and there was a cleaning lady asking for more minutes even the check in is from pm in this hotel on the other hand check out is at pm which is very generous but probably a reason why this is not working the staff seems to be confused or just not bothered enough in general
