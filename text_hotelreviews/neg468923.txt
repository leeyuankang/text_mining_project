the only thing i did not like we decided to have sat dinner at the hotel restaurant there was one waitress on duty and one waiter and we were only four small tables occupied our table x were totally ignored while the waiter spent the whole evening chatting to a couple with young children he was so rude the waitress although not as bad also busy chatting to a woman eating on her own while we were ignored never had such bad service in a hotel restaurant also they only give you one key to the room so if you are not with other guest when you return to the hotel you have to ask reception to come up with you to open room
