the reception staff were stiff and rather unhelpful when approached and we felt rather uncomfortable asking questions or their suggestions about any matter we had i being pregnant we came on this holiday to feel relaxed and if possible i would have enjoyed more warmth from them the room they gave us was dull and windows on looking to other rooms so we had no choice but to keep the curtains closed the entire duration of our stay on a another note i was very disappointed that booking com could either help us with the cancellation of our booking or help us get the best price which it promises with its best price guarantee policy
