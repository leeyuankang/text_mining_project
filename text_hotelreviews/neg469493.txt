no bar finding reception on arrival was not that obvious upgraded to junior suite which was ok bath small included a jacuzzi which was not connected oddly a wall mounted shower attachment was provided but was too short to be a proper shower so it was bath or nothing slippers but no bathrobe twin beds were pushed together but separated during night which was irritating coffee and water not replenished after first day not really a suite no hotel facilities so more of a bed and breakfast
