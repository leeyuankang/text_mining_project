the first room was very cold despite we had the heater turned on at c maximum had furnitures very worn the cleanliness wasn t the appropriate for a stars hotel and the toilet flusher needed fixing the hotel was fully booked so after two days they moved us to a better room in which we had the heater on at c i m writing this in order not anyone to think that we were eccentric weird customers but again with very worn furnitures
