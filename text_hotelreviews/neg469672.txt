this is not a star hotel the hotel said that they would be able to provide gluten free bread for my sister however on the morning when we were expecting the bread they informed us that they were not able to provide any this was clearly too late the dining area only sits people and considering there are rooms in this hotel breakfast was a tight squeeze in an area smaller than our actual room also they don t wash the blueberries before they place them in the serving bowl hotel is down a pretty quiet street if you re on your own i wouldn t book this place it s quite isolated even though it s off a main road no kettles in the rooms hotel is down a quiet street small dining area blueberries were not washed before being placed in the serving bowl not gluten free friendly making a mistake with our rooms we checked in and they gave us a suite then told us to move out traveling as a family of in rooms we were not put together put on different levels not good definitely not returning this is a shame because the location is great
