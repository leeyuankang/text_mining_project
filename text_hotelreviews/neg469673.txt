this definitely was not a star hotel it was not even comparable to the star in venice we stayed there was essentially no air conditioning it was so hot in the room we sweated the whole time and it was hard to sleep to top off the hot room the shower drain was broken and plugged up so we had to wait for the water levels to go down to finish a shower and before the next person could go there was no laundry service on the weekend which we didn t find out about until after we got it all bagged up there was no ice this was a miserable experience
