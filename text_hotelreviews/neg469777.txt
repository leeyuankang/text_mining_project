i did not appreciate the fact that my room was not ready i had an early check in but i am sure there were a lot of rooms that are ready and could have been assigned to me there were a couple of people who checked in the same time i did and were given their rooms no issue of early check in i was extremely tired i have been to busier hotels and had early check in with no problems
