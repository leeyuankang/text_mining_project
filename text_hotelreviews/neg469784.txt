the hotel overcharged us by quietly changing the room rates we had booked via booking com we knew about the additional city tax of course but they had entered the wrong rates on the system unfortunately we only noticed after the payment had gone through at which point the receptionist who admitted the mistake told us that refunds could only be processed centrally but someone would be in touch the next day i have since then emailed the hotel twice to request a refund but have not even received a reply they also tried to charge us for the minibar which was included in the room rate we did spot that one in time so i do wonder whether accidental overcharging might in fact be the norm here i find this a completely unacceptable level of customer service from a hotel and will never book with this chain again
