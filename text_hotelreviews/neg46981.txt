the room it s self was very small not enough room to even change i choose the room based on size i thought it was suppose to be a special weekend and our room was way smaller then it appeared in the photos i also wanted a bath tub and the way the bathtub was set up if was hard for me and my partner to get in i paid a lot of money for this room and we couldn t really move the pool was nice but the curtain hanging in there were very dirty and had a radish brown stain on about half of them we really didn t want to touch the sides
