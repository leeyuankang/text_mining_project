we were located on the floor where there was an alcove window the aircond didnt work and it was stifling hot made many calls to the front desk n told the compressor would be reset but aircond stil didnt work no solution was given other than asking us to leave the window open it was so noisy and as it was an alcove window the shutters could not be closed if the window was open imagine trying to sleep with ambulance and police sirens going off people shouting and traffic alongside night lights shining into the room bad nights the next morning when we asked for an explanation the guy at the front desk said all airconds in milan is turned off after oct if that was the case why werent we informed the night before and why the next hotel we stayed in which was the sheraton had its aircond working the way the staff handled the non working aircond made our stay horrible
