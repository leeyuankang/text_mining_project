don t be fooled by the pictures the actual rooms look different and smaller even though their parking was expensive parking was an extreme hassle too small you can t park or move to get in and out you have to take permission from the reception and they have to keep your key room service they actually charge you euro every time you order something breakfast was cold basically the hotel is average but it s overpriced for the actual value overall i would not recommend for the price
