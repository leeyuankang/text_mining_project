the hotel wants to give an impression of luxury and while this might be a quite good hotel they try to overdo and fail at some basic things it took me almost minutes to check out as there was only one person preparing the invoces there were actually only two people before me the invoice i got was wrong and i had to get it corrected via email upon arrival they took a copy of my personal id which afaik is illegal in most european countries the personnel tries to be nice but to me they seem to be disturbingly artificial in how they do it i came back at and the room was not yet cleaned for half the price it might make sense but given how much they charged me i will definitely avoid this hotel next time i m in paris
