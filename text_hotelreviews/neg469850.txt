the staff were discriminating although i had booked a classic double room for an exorbitant price i was first put up in an attic room which looked cramped i was offered no wifi login details although the site said free wifi available in the hotel i was thoroughly offended by this behaviour of the staff i would not recommend this hotel in my company for future travels absolutely no value for money
