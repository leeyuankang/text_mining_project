i believe this is a star hotel not based on its amenities there was no hot water pot or coffee available in the room there was no free drinking water there was no hour room service i wanted coffee at am i was told to wait until breakfast starts at breakfast was included but i was told that i could only have what was served not order eggs as i wanted them cooked there was only waiter setting up and serving coffee it was strange to say the least
