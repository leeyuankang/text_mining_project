the room was small the breakfast was disappointing the potatoes eggs and sausages were cold we ate there everyday as it was included in the room rate it was also difficult to get the attention of the servers it took a while to get the coffee every time we went there it was a bit of a surprise for us as the food we had in italy had always been delicious
