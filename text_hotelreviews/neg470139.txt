the room was rather small and utilitarian i had expected something more stylish but this was more like a functional business room it was very nice to have double doors leading onto the fragrant walkway but would have preferred to have had a terrace with a table to sit out the breakfasts were frankly poor juice not fresh coffee indifferent not much choice all very bog standard
