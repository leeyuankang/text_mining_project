the kettle in our room was old and when i served it s very hot water it spilled it everywhere we weren t harmed but this should not happen ever also from our room we could see some lights with their cables almost on a puddle of water with a good rain i believe the cables will be sumerge hopefully someone can make sure it s a safe connection we re having a lot of issues with marriott itself we did book one room thru booking com because marriott s web page was unable to do just that book a room but we got a second room on site now they won t honor points for our stay on that room and it seems they are unable to check if we were there or are unwilling or believe we re lying this is very frustrating and seems ridiculous
