one of the robes that was left for us to use appeared stained could not tell if it just hadn t been replaced or if it was newly washed would advise only putting out robes that are like new the hotel offered free breakfast but the only thing included was fruit juice and coffee tea for the price of the room it would have been nice to at least be offered a continental breakfast that included coffee tea juice and a pastry croissant
