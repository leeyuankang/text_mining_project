we went to the terrace bar and selected an open seat that was upwind due to cigarettes two girls non hotel guests came in and pointed our seat to the waiter he came and told us they were reserved and we had to leave we asked where he pointed to his head and said in here we informed the desk manager who said no seats are reserved a phone discussion followed between him and presumably the bar staff with frequent use of word americanos the desk manager said that if anything preference should be given to hotel guests i asked to speak to the hotel manger and i was informed that the manager was off for the weekend the next morning the staff failed to serve us in the breakfast room instead only serving a different ethnic persuasion it is quite apparent that anti u s sentiment is prevalent we are canadians and did not correct their mislabeling in many countries this conduct would be considered racist at the very least discrimination this behaviour is unacceptable and booking com should remove this location and their corporate partners from their service the hotel also failed to turn on the a c leaving the room at the centrally set rate of c i by passed this control but our travel freinds could not and the hotel took hours to put them in a smaller room there is no excuse for this practice and we do not know if it was the same anti u s discrimination or just plain incompetence
