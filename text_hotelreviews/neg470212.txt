my trip to milan was a business trip for nights only i arrived in a taxi to scala hotel and asked the front desk to pay the taxi then charge my room but refused so i asked them to support me with a change in order to pay the taxi but had zero support as thier excuse was no change was available i was literally stranded between the taxi and the hotel at night time without any help in addition i had no one to help me with my luggage during check in or check out not to mention the very poor wifi which was good for nothing moreover the breakfast variety was poor i had two nights paid in full but used only one night i had to look for another hotel the next morning i d rather lose my money and pay for another room at a different hotel than staying at scala hotel
