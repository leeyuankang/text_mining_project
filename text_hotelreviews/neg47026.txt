the bathroom was very tiny i expected more considering i had booked and paid for the king deluxe suite it appeared that it referred only to the size of the bed it was incredibly clean but it was a basic room no hd tv only one comfy chair and a desk chair there was no ice machine as stated but an ice bucket on the table fortunately i got a good deal through booking com i would not have paid the full price and the windows were dirty because it was called king deluxe i expected more however the hotel staff were absolutely fabulous this was a surprise for my husbands birthday and they were very generous in giving us a complimentary breakfast and went the extra mile and made him a fabulous birthday cake all in all it was a very pleasant stay the hotel staff were so attentive polite kind and very helpful
