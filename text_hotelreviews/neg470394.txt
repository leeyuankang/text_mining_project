floors in a room were not cleaned properly every day in breakfast room glasses for water juice were dirty it would be nice to have bedside table or smth on both side of double bed if you are there for a longer period and have a lot of clothes there may be not enough space for these in our opinion the ordered mojito was the worst we ve ever tried but maybe we were just unlucky if you have a light sleep you wake easily because of different sounds you should use earplugs as trains and neighbours sounds are easily heard
