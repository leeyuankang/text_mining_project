the restaurant bar wasn t amazing not a big variety of food there also didn t seem to be a huge amount of restaurants open around the area when our room was cleaned one morning dirty dishes weren t removed and were left all day which didn t leave the best smell in the room would be good to have a few more brochures around about tours to do etc
