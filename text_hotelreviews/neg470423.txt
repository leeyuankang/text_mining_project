everything was very fine except the receptionists that were cold and uninterested and the location that was very very far from the center don t event think to stay here if you are going to milano by summer because you will be exposed to horrible efforts to go back from the city to the hotel there is no bus station near the metro station on your way back and if you mannage to go to the first one you will be horribly exausted cause all of the bus stations are at the sunny part of the street with no any protection above your head definately bad location
