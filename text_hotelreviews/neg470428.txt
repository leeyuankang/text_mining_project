shower tray did not drain quickly so had to stop water in middle of showering to ensure shower tray did not overflow coffee cups were very small and there was always a long line for it a little bit out of the way and not close to the nearest metro station would highly suggest getting a travel card to catch the bus to the station otherwise it s a walk no good restaurants nearby big supermarket offered fresh pasta and the like but no microwave or other facilities to heat up food would have liked the hotel to have a restaurant as the location to the nearest food isn t so good or have communal facilities like a kitchen etc to heat up food from supermarket wall near my bed had dents in which was off putting mini fridge was not cold didn t even freeze the ice for the days we were there
