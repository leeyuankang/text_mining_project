the breakfast was poor i was waiting for half an hour for greasy oily bacon the choices were underwhelming food cutlery wasn t replenished you had to ask several times to get staff to bring out new stuff the wifi is poor in the hotel the staff are rude and dismissive there was no information or welcome pack when we arrived although it said it was a star hotel i beg to differ they couldn t give us any recommendations of place to go which i found very odd overall i wouldn t stay there again
