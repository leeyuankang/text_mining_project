although the hotel has stars i liked it much less than the milan hotel i stayed in although i was convinced we booked a double room we got a twin bed room with two separate beds although the facility in general was in fine state there was a small rip in our room curtain that i reported since i didn t want to get charged for it personnel apologized so it was fine but it does set the overall property as used there is no closeby subway stop which was the mode of transport we generally used next to walking so the long walk to the hotel from central it got a bit annoying at the end of long sightseeing days do have to say that there is a parking garage of the hotel so presumably it is good if you are travelling by car as parking in the centre seemed quite an issue in general the professional but impersonal approach put me off a bit since the wifi is really slow i wanted to use the only pc in the internet room it didn t seem connected to internet so i asked at the front desk and the man literally replied what can i do rather than solving the problem luckily his colleague was more helpful the next day and explained me that this pc also needs to connect to wifi rather than network cable so it was sorted fast also during breakfast i felt sorry for the people that worked there because they felt understaffed or under organised to deal with it in a huge rush slamming new plates and cutlery on the table after guests left to make place for new running around to refresh food platters etc the people were polite but seemed under pressure also i missed tea coffee facilities in our room leaving you to use vending machines in the corridor which i didn t use
