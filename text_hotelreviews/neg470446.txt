the staff of the restaurant was impolite they did not speak english very small space for restaurant we had to wait to eat not to mention they didn t refill the food on time so we had to wait for ten or more minutes to eat and i had to go all the time back and forth to ask for it they didn t have roomservice and there was no place to eat or drink something in the hotel
