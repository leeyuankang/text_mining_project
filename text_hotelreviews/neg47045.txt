the beds were not that comfortable and the pillows were like soft marshmallows we asked for firmer ones which were brought promptly there wasn t three bottles of water left for us but two even though we were three people there was also only just enough tea coffee for a cup each and they wasn t replenished we also asked for more toilet paper as one was misteriously taken after our room was cleaned strangely during the saturday evening as we were getting ready to go out a quiet knock on the door came swiftly followed by a member of staff walking straight in i was sat in a towel drying my hair and she just said she was just checking we were okay i looked blankly as i tried to adjust my towel red cheeked and said we were fine thanks she apologised and left think it was a mistake but all the same strange and awkward didn t like the fact that the hotel debited my account each night to cover any expenditure and then refunded most hotels just take your card details and use as and when you spend
