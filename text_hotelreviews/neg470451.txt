hotel property is far away from public transportation upon our arrival to hotel and checking to room we realized that toilet was broken no water glasses in room no opener for beer when we asked on reception to fix that they said tomorrow but tomorrow never happen then coming to breakfast we discovered that for that large hotel room was no more than sqm and we wore sitting like in public canteen not enough food and people for fitting for seat and to grab some food i can expect that in star hotel price for this hotel during eurosalone was enormously high
