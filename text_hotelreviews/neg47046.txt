my booking was for adults and the room was only suitable for occupants with which on arrival the hotel did raise they did say that they had had issues with booking com and the booking should not have been taken but the hotel was going to honour the booking as long as we were happy with the arrangement which the last thing i wanted to be doing was to start looking for a new hotel the hotel did what they could to make our stay as comfortable as possible with offer of further bed covers and pillows if we needed them
