we booked a double room and they gave us a twin room and told us there aren t any double rooms available in my opinion this is a major problem considering the fact that it s a four star hotel you can t just change the room without notifying the client and you can t just decide which client gets which room basing on the country he she is from however when asked for an explanation they joined beds in about ten minutes so why couldn t they do this from the beginning secondly they charged my card with euro in advance although the cancellation of the room was free even if this is the hotel policy this is not what they sold on booking
