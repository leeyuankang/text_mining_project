the breakfast was a little bit poor than i expected and some of the food was tasteless the juice machine was constantly remaining without juice and the coffee was horrible if you want you can order good coffee from the guys that take care of the tables and they will bring you the goodies from the back also we had to wait for cutlery because there weren t enough and some of them were dirty
