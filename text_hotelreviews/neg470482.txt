room was too hot apparently we should have told the reception staff so they could regulate that for us also a note on the bathroom wall said if we left the towels on the floor they would be collected but if we wanted to use them again to leave them on the rails but the towels were changed every day anyway not as environmentally friendly as i had hoped
