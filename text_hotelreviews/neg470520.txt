breakfast is terrible it is one of the poorest breakfast i had in italy juice from syrup the cheapest one and the coffee is extremely bad from a nescafe machine this hotel should be stars instead of but probably they know as well so that s why they offer you so low price do not expect too much so then it is ok otherwise it is far away from a star quality
