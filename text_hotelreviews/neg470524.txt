the location of this hotel is really not good i dont mind staying a little bit out of town as long as there is a metro station near by the nearest metro station istria is about km away but i whould not suggest walking from there late at night or with a big suitcase another metro station sondrio is about or km away and you can take a bus for about half of the distance ok for one night if you dont mind a little extra walking
