relatively good hotel location room size breakfast etc were ok for who and why added forth star is inexplicable wifi was very slow and you have to enter code every min but biggest problem is breakfast kitchen definitely is unable to service everybody in time so getting spoons forks cups and food itself is a challenge you have to ask staff about it all the time please bring forks please bring eggs etc really annoying
