in my opinion it s not the hotel we had stayed in other european cities in italy as well in hotels before and we had bigger and cleaner rooms and much more variety for breakfast thus in average ih hotels milano gioia is not bad at all but it s rather hotel for instance you almost do not get any vegetables for breakfast and do not have fresh juice at all the room was not that clean for example we had some small garbage in the garbage pin but in average you get the adequate service for the money you pay
