the organization of breakfast is poor the coffee machine generates a huge queue as it is in a corner staff at the front desk is quite not friendly or knowledgeble asked for advice regarding open shop for cigarettes but they failed to know any location in the neighborhood be prepared for groups and go to have breakfast as early as possible otherwise like us have to line for enter for breakfast the breakfast is very understaffed only two ladies were doing their very best but they could not cope with guests at the same time
