there was no ketlltle to make hot drinks i could not drink anything i had to buy everything the directions were poor it took me hours to locate it the fridge in the room was not working the breakfast was basic and if any item finished it was not replaced so if any guest came later most food stuffs were finished the staff had poor english language content so communication was a challenge i had chosen a twin room and was offered a double room and had to explain to them in the whole i would not stay there again and would not recommend it to anyone
