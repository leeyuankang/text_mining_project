the breakfast was very simple a lot of cakes but very little notmal food i had a feeling that the boiled eggs were min week old the room was very small and the conditioner was very loud during the night besides of that there was a door in the room leading to the neighbour room you could hear everything happening behind that door this hotel is definitely not worth that price
