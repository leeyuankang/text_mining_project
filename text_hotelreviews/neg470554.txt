the hotel is located in an area that looks derelict with abandoned grafitti covered buildings it is about minutes from the closest underground station and the walk to it is bad looking although the hotel sports stars it actually felt more like a star accomodation of course the price too is star so no complaint on that the staff is not particularly helpful or welcoming we sometimes had the impression we were inconveniencing them the whole hotel gives the impression that it has known better times it is perfectly clean but there are things that do not work and that have not been repaired e g noisy climatisation clogged shower bassin stained carpet toilet button not working etc it feels like they are struggling for money and cannot afford to repair such minor things
