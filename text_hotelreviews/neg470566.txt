the rooms were obviously being cleaned often but the mold persisted between the tiles of the bathroom and other corners and the water spots were either scrubbed away by a very hard working cleaning staff along with the chrome finishing or were just persisting in lack of proper cleaning substance a lot of spots on the floor chair covered in extensive spots of sweat and other bodily liquids the toast served for breakfast had a moldy smell throughout the occasions we were there for breakfast the towels were smelly like they were being just dried rather than washed the management is definitely cutting costs from every angle
