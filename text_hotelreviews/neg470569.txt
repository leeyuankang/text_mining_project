poorly organized in many ways internet did not work at all one whole day a disaster for a business traveler always a line at reception sometimes a long one with only one person serving customers while two or three did something else this scene repeated several times during my stay staff failed to order a taxi as requested location very desolate although not far from everything coffee machine not working at breakfast and it serves only instant coffee anyway no restaurant but there is a very good and inexpensive trattoria nearby
