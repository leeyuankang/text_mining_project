the personnel has poor english skills they gave us a room for disabled people and we had already paid for a double room with queen bed they changed the room but not with the one i paid for and saw on booking saying that the pictures were old and rooms don t look like that anymore the room was small without a wardrobe and no slippers the wi fi can be accessed with a code but it would disconnect every minutes which was unpleasant
