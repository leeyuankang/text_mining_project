i have been in so many hotels around europe but i haven t seen such a worst staff first i don t know who gave stars to this hotel but for sure is not there is no concierge porter the reception staff is answering to any questions and people are in que i needed to wait min they don t know basic stuffs like direction busses we went there after the football game and my girlfriend asked the reception for a bowl with hot milk they told us that everything is closed and they dont have even a bowl so they gave us small coffee take away cups total no more than ml milk and charge us euros for less than ml milk bathroom was very dirty the shower cabin is meter very small the shower rose is full limestone the water canal was blocked so takes min to leek i have been i stars hotels in milan which are way better than this star hotel so if you want proper hotel for this money choose something else wifi is terrible they give you hours code and you need to enter this code every time when you want to connect if you are not using you device for even a minute the wifi automatically disconnect you device
