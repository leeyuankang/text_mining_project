showerhead was very dirty pressure was poor and the water cold we did not have a good shower for the duration of our stay the room temperature dial was a mystery it was boiling hot for the first hours you need to get a new wifi code every hours from the front desk good selection of food but the quality was poor and i would advise sticking to the croissants and fruit
