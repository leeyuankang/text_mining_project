the hotel had mold basically everywhere we have changed room three times for the first time because of dirty bathroom and lack of tv set second time because of the mold which still persisted in the third room but the conditions did not change when i saw that in the third room we stayed there was a mold over our head i completely lost patience i wanted to talk to the booking manager and ask for refund unfortunately during three days we stayed there the manager was not in the office on the second day we woke up because of the water dropping from the ceiling we contacted hotel via email provided at the reception and via complaint email received by booking com but after days there is still no sign from ih hotels milano gioia the conditions are not acceptable for any sort of hotel this is four star hotel but neither the conditions nor the service is of we recommend you to stay out and choose another hotel
