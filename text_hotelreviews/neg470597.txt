we experienced a multitude of events which led to us not enjoying our stay our first room was okay but noisy due to the location of the hotel near train tracks and presumably industrial sights there were often loud banging noises and train noises that disrupted us other than that it was okay but on the night we returned to our room to find the pipe under the sink had broken off and due to a dripping tap the bathroom floor had started pooling water this is when our trouble started when we approached the staff to have the situation sorted out we were made to feel like we were inconveniencing them making us uncomfortable as a whole the reception staff were rude in our second room there was no toilet seat the lamp was hanging out of the wall socket and electrocuted me also the hot water in the shower was malfunctioning when we returned to the desk to ask if there were any other rooms available all we were told was no even though we later checked the booking com app and saw that rooms were available for booking on the sight also facilities that were advertised on the booking com listing were non existent these were laundry and shuttle bus the breakfast was expansive but the quality especially of the coffee and hot food was not great in general the facility was not what you d expect of a star hotel stained carpets and walls one wall of a corridor outside our first room covered in mould the location itself made you feel like you were in a ghetto with abandoned buildings and dark streets however it wasn t too inconvenient to get to the city centre if you don t mind walking and waiting for public transport all in all we did not enjoy our stay and will not return to the hotel however we did love milan
