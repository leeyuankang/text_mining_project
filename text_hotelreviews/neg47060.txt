the breakfast service would be improved by one person in the dining room being assigned to several tables and an offer of tea and coffee rather than an everything is just there approach i was told only the chef could order the gluten free toast but the chef who was cooking and serving hot breakfasts had a long queue the hot water dispenser for the tea was part of the complicated coffee machine with no signage the water dispensed straight into a mug and teabags on request all of which i found out after asking four members of staff location wise the hotel is actually several minutes walk away from marble arch not at marble arch as i had thought there were problems with the lifts stopping and starting the weekend we were there and very long queues to use them when i mentioned this on checking out the receptionist apologised but said they were not aware i was charged for wifi and had thought as a marriott member it was included so beware of extra charges
