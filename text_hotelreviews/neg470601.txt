the most problematic aspect was the position at the end of a dark street not very close to all the transport means metro is about walking but at mins walking there are busses that connect to the very centre of the city it is just a matter of studying public transport around the area the indications from the reception were not really helpful i also noticed some small details the licking tap in the toilette repaired the last night the toilet paper holder was broken small things but i would not expect to see them in a stars hotel
