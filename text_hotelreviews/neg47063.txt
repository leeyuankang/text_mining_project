we booked a room for people we had glasses coffee cups towels when we asked for extra bits to be brought to the room they didn t arrive we also then had to ask for sheets for the sofa bed we were told a member of staff would make up the bed he didn t and just chucked the sheets on the floor if you book a room for you expect people to be catered for this experience was very poor and a real nuisance
