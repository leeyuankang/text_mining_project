this is an ageing hotel that needs a makeover i paid night you can get better quality for this price i paid for high speed internet with poor connectivity and slow response that s a historical way of doing business in a city where free internet is omnipresent in every coffee shop bookstore and corner restaurant the mattress was awful big dip in the middle and i was constantly rolling into the middle of the bed they need new mattresses the gym was decently equipped with a small pool and jacuzzi but really squashed in a tiny space in the basement reasonably located near the center of london but nowhere near the standard i expected nor close to that of sofitel s nearby i have stayed at the neighborhood has many middle eastern establishments adding to the usual cultural diversity of the swinging city
