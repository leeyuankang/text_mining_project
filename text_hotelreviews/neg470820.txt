this is not a hotel by any stretch it feels like it s run by amateurs and is basically a glorified guest house following many requests to fix the air con and a plethora of excuses ranging from it s broken i can t adjust the program etc to italian law states that we can t allow you to use the air con i had to demand that the staff turn on the air con only when i threatened not to pay did the air con suddenly turn itself on everything is an extra from the tea bags to the jacuzzi breakfast is the bar restaurant is in the basement and is tiny don t stay here take your business elsewhere
