unfortunately the person serving in the bar put the invoice from other drinking guests at my room so when i payed the bill for my room and what i had in the bar the evening before it also included what my neighbor had ordered to his table when i payed attention to this fact the chief of the hotel started to blame me for i had noticed this and complained after i already had payed the bill before i left the hotel he promised reluctantly to see to it that the difference should be payed back at my account today one week after this happened i still have payed the bill also for the neighbor some tables away from my table that night so instead of apologize and correct the mistake of the barman he blamed me for having noticed this to late so unusually and astonishingly bad bj rn andersson
