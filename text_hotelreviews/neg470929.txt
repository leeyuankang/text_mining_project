we were forced to stay in this hotel as other ones where overbooked on those particular dates overall the hotel is ok if you re a businessman with a laptop and a suit however if your are a traveler and adventurer in your soul then you should go for other options there is nothing bad in this hotel however ir feels so best western or intercontinental it s boring it s also a bit worn out there is almost nothing italian there
