this is not a star hotel we have stayed here multiple times over the years and always loved it but now they had no computer for me to use to access internet and print boarding passes the air conditioning in our room did not work and no one could fix it the tv lacked any channels with english sub titles as we were told there would be at least channels to make matters worse the person they sent to fix it couldn t even operate the remote control we spent our entire time there unable to watch tv while sweating the neighbor is now run down and dangerous
