the man at the reception desk when we arrived on sunday night was extremely rude tried to charge us more for the room and then gave us a room where the a c did not work when we complained he promised to fix the a c but left his shift without doing it the nice woman who replace him gave us a new room still i am sure there are other hotels in the area where all the reception staff is polite go there
