the staff at the reception very unfriendly no smile didn t want to give two room keys for two adults when i requested he was like giving an attitude and without saying anything ran the second card through the machine and gave it to me without even giving an eye contact it was a look like why do you really need two cards if you are a couple well mr if you need to insert your room key in the slot in your room for the light to work and if one person stays in the room and the other has to go out for whatever reason they have each one needs a key one for keeping the light on in the room and the second one for the second person to enter back in the room without bothering the other person and why do you not like a guest requesting two keys is that asking for a lot
