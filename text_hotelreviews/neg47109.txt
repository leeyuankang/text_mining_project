very small room and beds for three people we where three friends in a tiny room that they sell as a triple room with two double beds we where supposed to sleep two people in one small bed not at all what i expected according to the price and the name you had to pay for wi fi in the room which costs gbp for hours i have never tried not to have wi fi included in the price and it is extra disappointing at marriott for that price
