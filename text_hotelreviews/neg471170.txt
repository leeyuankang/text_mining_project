it is not probably a stars hotel the rooms are a bit dated but large and sunny and even if clean floor cleaning could be more accurate towels and sheets are perfectly clean my bathroom was with the bath tube and a glass to allow a shower but due to a bad sealant the water drips on the floor part of it generously furthermore the windows are very new but there are no curtains and the glass is transparent in the bathroom so you can either close the external shutter or perform exhibits for the people living in the building on the opposide side of the street this should be corrected because it is not so good having to do everything with the artificial light on this problem is not present in the room overall i rate these problems as minor issues that the property will surely periodically address so overall i think it s ok last largo domodossola is quite noisy in some hours of the day mainly because of the trams
