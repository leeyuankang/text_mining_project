the breakfast was not the greatest it was adequate but not nearly as good as the the previous two hotels we stayed at more fresh fruit instead of canned would be an improvement also scrambled eggs were watery and tasted powdered boiled eggs were a better choice but it would have been better to have them soft or medium boiled instead of hard boiled coffee was excellent however
