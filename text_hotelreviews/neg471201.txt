wifi connection was really poor and also if you needed bathrob or slippers you had to call and ask when you go to the hotel tired after flight and you need a shower it is really uncomfortable to find out that there are no bathrobe and slippers and that firtstly you need to call to the reception ask for them and then wait when they will deliver
