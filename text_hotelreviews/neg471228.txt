we requested for a simple packed breakfast for our last morning as we had an early train to catch this request was made twice upon check in and again on our last night there both times we were assured that it would be possible to get it however we did not get the packed breakfast and the morning receptionist told us that the request was not put through to the kitchen as the night staff had personal problems and did not focus on her work that is surely a sorry excuse
