location since the property is in a business area and surrounded by other buildings there were limited places to visit see or eat and there was hardly anyone around on the streets this did make walking around in the evening more difficult if not impossible as there was large groups of homeless stationed on the street corner that felt more like skid row they didn t bother us but being females we didn t leave anything to chance also not the hotel s fault and the rating does not apply food drinks limited selections on both we had breakfast included not worth it unless you are in desperate need of food in the morning and a firm no on the room service
