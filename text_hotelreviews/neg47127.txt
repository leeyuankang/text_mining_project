the lift was broken that enable you to go to the leisure club so the alternative was to go out of the hotel down flights of stairs through the underground car park it was absolutely freezing also i had to carry my daughter down two flights of stairs an absolute nightmare the main reason we chose this hotel was for its leisure facilities i understand that this was an issue that was out of the hotels control however the manager on duty at the time was totally unsympathetic and kept saying it was out of their control i knew it was out of their control also the beds were too soft so we had backache
