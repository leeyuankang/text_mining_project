highly incompetent staff with poor personal skills i was part of a group of people family with children with rooms for nights stay during a voice controlled dispute about a quoted rate not being honored a manager ripped my phone out of my hands and then called the police the issue was thankfully resolved by the general manger who realized how inappropriate his staff had acted prior to this act i mentioned that i would be contacting booking com to let them know about how they are not honoring the rate i also mentioned that i would be posting a review on the manger s aggressive demeanor i then proceeded to take my phone out to take a picture of his badge when before i even took a picture he had ripped the phone out of my hand borderline assault this all took place in front of my children and family there were numerous other issues but obviously this was the most striking one i will never stay at this hotel again
