the receptionist was not friendly and welcoming we had to park our car in their parking it is very difficult to find we received just a few explanations you have to have someone from the hotel open you the parking door and you have to leave your keys at the reception it was not convinient at all when you have luggages plus it cost eur just for one night this is really a scam the location is close to a business area which makes the place completely dead during the week end with several bums on the streets no decent restaurant in the neighbourhood
