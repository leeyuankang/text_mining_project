i had a very unpleasant experience at that hotel the cost of my stay was prepaid two months in advance before we arrived upon checking in the guy at the reception made a mistake and blocked the cost for my stay from my account even though it was prepaid total amount pounds that was the money i intended to spend during my short stay in london instead i had to borrow money from a friend i didn t receive a single word of apology not a thought of compensating me for this horrible inconvenience instead i was charged pounds a day for using wifi i am very disappointed i checked out and my money has not been released yet i just can t understand how any hotel can treat its customers in such an arrogant manner
