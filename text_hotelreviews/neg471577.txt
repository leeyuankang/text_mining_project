we rented two rooms mine was fine but my parents accommodation had some problems the air conditioning wasn t working and it wasn t easy to convince the staff that it wasn t a matter of not knowing how to use it they changed rooms in the following day and provided a fan for the first one but if they believed them sooner they would probably have a room in the same day and to be fair they wouldn t have to endure the not so polite complains from my father their second room had great ac but was turned to the street and the noise from the public transportation was heard until late hours overall if you re a big person bathroom s douche is going to be small for you the extra blanket for winter was super itchy the tv is small and in a strange position just one room key card per room
