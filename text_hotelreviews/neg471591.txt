although it wasn t a problem for us the location might be a little less convenient for those who are not fit and mobile it s a minute walk from the central station and a minute walk to the nearest metro station which has lots of steps although a tram runs past the front door the routes don t go directly to the city centre having said that the metro from piazza repubblica once you ve got there whisks you to the middle of milan in a few minutes
