i did not get a reply from my message when i booked and this was annoying at first once sorted and understood staff were happy to help us out with our request info given to us about train times and platforms and how to get tickets is not current so really put pressure on us when we went to the station and we had to work out how to get our tickets and then were to catch the train hotel needs to update this if they are going to give this info out to travellers
