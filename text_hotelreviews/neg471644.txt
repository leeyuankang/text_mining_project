breakfast buffet a food that should be kept cooled is not being kept cool hotel perhaps needs to review its haccp food management controls b safety issues the location of the buffet at the entrance to the breakfast room is completely impractical and its layout is rather cramped being located at the entrance to the room actually impedes guests access to and from the room safety issue fire issue practical issue this results in hotel guests bumping into one another at breakfast time or being unable to pass one another to access the breakfast fare it is easy to knock over items accidentally too because everything is tightly packed into a relatively small space some items such as fruit juice glasses are placed well out of reach of shorter hotel guests the room is split level and you could just miss seeing the steps that lead down into the main area of tables and fall down safety issue c the stainless steel scrambled egg container contained a huge congealed mass of egg resembling a gigantic omelette very unappetising no one seems to come and stir it up and make it look like proper scrambled eggs d breakfast staff perfunctory no one greets you with a good morning room a needs upgrading change the heavy sheets for lighter duvets b beds are too low for older guests they need to be higher c black fungal growth mould in bathroom around shower shower doors and where shower unit is attached to floor unsightly unhygienic the white sealant in bathroom needs spraying and or replacing d shower units have clearly reached the end of their economic life e height of room toilets is too low typical of italian hotels hotel facilities no lunch dinner or spa facilities no pool business centre some equipment was out of order all this seems rather unusual for a hotel claiming to have a star rating bar no price list of drinks displayed in bar area
