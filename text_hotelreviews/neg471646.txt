avoid this hotel i wish i had i cannot believe this joint claims stars would be closer the mark on a good day at first it looks good has been refurbished but its a front i am glad we were only here en route for night otherwise i would have been looking to find an alternative air con as we found out is only turned on with the seasons do not think you can control the comfort level for your taste as that is dictated by the front desk who when asked refused to change it and told us to open a window which we did onto a street filled with heavy traffic trams and noise all night i think it is appalling and downright rude not to allow guests to create their own comfort level something which is falsely advertised as being offered on their web site the bathrooms are poor there is one difficult to use hand held shower situated half way down the wall so ladies if like my wife you have long hair expect a struggle no peep hole in the room door for security something to consider breakfast was ok but they will not open the door until exactly hrs so if like us you are on the move do not expect to have a breakfast most hotels offer breakfast for early travellers at or at least we spoke to another guest who like us was a night stay and he was not one bit happy one female staff member on the desk was ok but she is outnumbered by others who are little better than rude and indifferent the beds were so so but on wheels which on a wooden floor move from the wall on the whole one very long uncomfortable night prior to an hour train ride booking com should remove them from the website save others the hassle we have travelled a lot over the years and this place would be in the top spot for failed expectations
