the pillows were thin and not as comfortable as the mattress the room had no tea coffee facilities in the room there was no booklet of the hotel with all the useful information nothing downstairs there was a touch screen device with most of its features not working the breakfast contained mostly sweets with just a few savoury options only tomatoes as veggies options and only days i saw whole wheat bread no toaster in visible sight the room had only chair for a double room and no armchair where to relax the front door had finger marks on it for days before we left nobody seem to notice there was an elderly man as part of the staff walking around with a red coat that coat was so dirty i would expect a star hotel to pay more attention to these sort of details definitely cleanliness in the afternoon and evening is something they need to focus more
