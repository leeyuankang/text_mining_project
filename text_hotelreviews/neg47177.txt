i was expected to pay a deposit for our stay even though the room was paid for in full before our stay although this was above the amount of other more prestigious hotels in london to gain card details in the case we returned from our night out as irrational destructive human beings i was refused to use a debit card with my actual money in the account in favour of a false economy credit card to which the receptionist was quite stone faced and rude also there was only bottles of water in our room when the booking was for guests but i imagine that they expected us to use the rationed tea bag per person and only sweetners if the third person was at all thirsty the location was completely out of the way with a long walk to a tube station
