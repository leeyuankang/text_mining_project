this is not their fault necessarily so im not including it in my rating but its worth mentioning that there is an unstated euro per person per night tax that is not advertised on booking com it was explained as a tourist tax to help with the upkeep of historical sites but that is ridiculous since they all have steep entrance charges to access anyway almost every museum or site has a charge already associated with it just be aware that for example you are staying for five nights and your credit card has been charged on booking com that you will still be paying more when you arrive a couple staying for nights would end up paying euro more than what the advertised price was on booking com so its worth being aware of and i dislike the fact that it is not clearly stated in advance the only other dislikes here would be the beds and pillow that were very uncomfortable but in the grand scheme of things it is not a show stopper the tv was a weird little inch think mounted on top of a cabinet at a strange upward angle that made it impossible to watch again not a huge deal for us since we didn t plan on spending any time in the room watching tv anyway
