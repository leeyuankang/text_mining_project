the personnel was completely uninterested in the guests i booked a superior room and the rate included room service nevertheless upon our arrival we were accommodated in a standard room when i went downstairs and asked staff at the reception if there has been a mistake i could see from the pictures in the email confirmation that the rooms were supposed to look very different i was rudely replied you have a superior room madam we are not trying to cheat here the pictures are not correct when i asked about a difference in the room standard in that case it was explained by provided vegan shampoo shower gel in superior rooms which was a bit ridiculous given the room pictures on the website and elevator showed different the included room service was admitted only after i showed the confirmation of the booking and asked the guy to check with his manager although the room has not been changed after all and no apologies for any caused inconvenience were given by either of them it is a real pity as the neighbourhood and facilities of the hotel are really good our standard room was quite nice and comfortable but because of the reaction of the personnel and the way they handled this situation i will not stay there again
