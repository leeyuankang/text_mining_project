we booked a room with single beds but upon arrival received double bed when we asked for another room they said that nothing else is available then a house keeper moved beds apart from each other there was a lot of dust on the carpet between beds house keeper was changing linens and cleaning the carpet while we were staying in the door service is poor everything looks better on photos than it is in reality
