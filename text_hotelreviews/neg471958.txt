staff making you wait avoiding eye contact until they eventually allow you to hand in your key staff shouting we are clearing the breakfast buffet in ten minutes and rigidly sticking to their plan removing items as guests were still selecting complimentary snacks no you have to buy a drink to have a snack sir can i have some ice to my room that will be seven euro can i have milk in my room to go with the tea and coffee again as i have asked the previous two days wood surrounding the sink is split and peeling not what i would expect of a suite at this price shower is like light rain in the afternoon sunshine not enough to soak you but enough that you may still be wet when you walk through to the bedroom hairdryer like the warm breath of an estranged aunt all in all at the price the facilities are not of a great standard the staff are not difficult but seem to see guests as something of an inconvenience they are fine when you eventually get their attention but that can take a while although some are much better than others in short they make you feel like they are doing you a favour for the simplest request
