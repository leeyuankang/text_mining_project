staff could ve been a bit more clued up failed to check my booking room assigned was not what i asked for i requested a double and on entering the room was given a twin so was offered a double in the lower ground it didn t smell very pleasant in the room and the mattresses need to be changed i was advised i had been upgraded this was probably due to the error made on check in however even though the room may have been bigger there were no extras in the room and the tv was much smaller clearly not an upgrade i don t know i guess for i was expecting a lot more for a night stay on checking in i was asked to pay for breakfast as its more expensive on the day yet it was already part of the rate i didn t have the best start to staying here unfortunately and not even a helping hand with my bag considering the error of assigning me the wrong room laid with the hotel breakfast could ve been more fresh and hotter appreciate i had arrived before it closed yet it was still in the valid timeset
