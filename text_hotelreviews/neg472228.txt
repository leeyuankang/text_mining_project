the booking was prepaid so our entire stay was already paid weeks earlier than we arrived upon arrival i was asked to present the credit card i used for the booking that means the exact same physical credit card when checking in i expect to have to give a credit card in case of extra expenses during the stay so i gave them the one i had with me however it appeared to be a problem that it was not the precise one used for the booking i don t understand this i travelled to best western hotels in japan china usa germany and more and it never ever happened that people cared about having the exact same card i did the booking with i could somehow understand it if i had only secured the booking and still had to pay on checkout but here it was even prepaid i finally managed to retrieve my credit card bill in which the booking transaction appeared because fortunately i had gotten it a few days earlier and it was easily accessible online and this did the trick i still don t get why it was needed i am ready to accept that it is required for some reasons i don t know but asking for the precise card used for the booking is highly non standard even more when prepaid so it should at least be clearly indicated somewhere i checked the booking confirmation sheet and this requirement appears nowhere what if i was travelling on a business trip and my stay was paid with my company credit card i would not have had easily access to any bill and would not have had the credit with me either the minimum thing to do would thus be to indicate this requirement in huge bold letters in the hotel description or the confirmation the future travellers owning more than one credit card and not always going around with all of them will be grateful
