we arrived very late at night and we walked around the neighborhood a bit because the hotel sign was so small that we could not see it from the main road there are a few best western hotels in the neighbourhood so be careful with the name when you ask for directions our wifi did not work and we had no map so we went round in circles a bit but later in the day we found that it was not difficult to access from the train station plenty of indian and chinese restaurants and just mins from one of the biggest shopping centers
