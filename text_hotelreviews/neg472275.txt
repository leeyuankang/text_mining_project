room service offered was very poor they were always out of stock of food when wanting to order something what i specially disliked was that the ham and cheese toasts offered were made from left over food from breakfast it was a hot sandwich with one slice of bread being around thick on top of that the slices were from different types of bread my bf ordered the cotoletta and it was a thin frozen piece of chicken on a bed of rocket salad with some slices of ham and cheese definitely not worth the
