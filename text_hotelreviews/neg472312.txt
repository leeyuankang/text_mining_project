the service at the reception quite disappointing for a hotel of this chain they recommended us to use the parking external seems to be a different company they have an agreement with because it can be dangerous at night and something can get broken this does not say anything nice about the location actually coming from them what this receptionist andrea didn t tell us was that there was a marathon in the city and we wouldn t be able to pick up the car between and as the street where the parking is we did not even see the parking as they parked the car would not be accessible we only learnt about this from the receptionist when we got back to the hotel at midnight he was very nice with us and did his best to solve the issue however the one at the reception the previous evening surely knew about the marathon in the city right they took out the car and parked it early in the morning in a street that we could have access to we paid euros for a parking for that we barely used and when we mentioned this upon check out they said you used the parking thank you for being more interested in making us pay than making us comfortable
