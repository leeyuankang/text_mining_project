we had an early flight and landed in milan at hotel check in at understood when i booked the room i mentioned early check in and the hotel made no effort to get us in before we had a tour at pm so we had no access to a hotel room from until after our tour it was unpleasant we called at noon to see if there was a chance to have access earlier no also the room was very small only room to sleep
