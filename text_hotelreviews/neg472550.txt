there were ceratin things where style seemed to override practical considerations like nice bathroom but nowhere to hang the larrger towels up to dry we had a small balcony but it was surrounded by a high wall hanging rails for clothes that were so high up i had to stretch and my wife couldn t reach nice restaurant on the top floor but again outside balcony surrounded by a concrete wall so no view
