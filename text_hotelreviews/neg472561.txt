ac system is terrible you cannot control it from the switch in your room and even if you are freezing during the night you cannot do anything the receptionists kept on lying to us about what they can do or cannot do with the air conditioner one day they tell you that they are turning the ac in your room off but it is obvious that they do nothing cause you cannot sleep due to freezing air and noise in your room next day they tell you that they are not able to turn it off at all
