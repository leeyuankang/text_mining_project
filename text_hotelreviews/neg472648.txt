our stay was going well until saturday night when very loud music was played at the bar i called to complain but the hotel did nothing the music was so loud that it prevented me from sleeping really frustrating when you have an early morning flight and only get an hour of sleep the night before i would expect a star hotel not to allow music but apparently not the low rating is because of the music
