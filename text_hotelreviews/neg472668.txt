understaffed reception person waited minutes while many staff hang around doing whatever i really wonder asked for tap water time in the gym before getting it times before staff told me they would bring but nothing arrived room service was really poor very disappointed by meals tried over maybe and they were all cold and sad glass of whine was just awful in quality and ridiculous in quantity i took a picture breakfast is not great no made to minute food at all only cold things and on my day nobody offered me coffee not significant issues but accumulation of small desapointments make the stay good but not great
