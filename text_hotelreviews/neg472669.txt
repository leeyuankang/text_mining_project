if you are travelling by bus tram or metro with luggages its very very difficult as you have to climb the stairs to cross the bridge and also walking with your luggage for another km if during rainy days its worst as we know taxi is very expensive in milan due to the luggages we have to carry and its rainy day going to airport we have to take taxi which cost us compare to only per person if we go by train n bus there is no signage to the hotel from the station
