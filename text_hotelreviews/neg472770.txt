the hotel is far from stars when we arrived first thing we noticed was a very strong cigarette smell i am a casual smoker and are not usually bothered but this was only you could smell the receptionist did not say hello instead decided to take phone calls and ignore us for once he finally decided to serve us he just handed the keys and sent us off the room was smelly small and not comfortable the slightest our beds were rock hard and we found out that two towels were used as sheets on both beds we decided to stay for one night and see how the breakfast was another disappointment boiled eggs from the day before no toast or anything fresh what they called coffee was some kind of dark brown muddy water that was not drinkable at all this was the worst hotel experience i have had we checked out and stayed in a lovely starhotel ritz min walk from the central station
