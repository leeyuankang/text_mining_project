our first impression during check in was that the reception staff was not very friendly it could be that they are not fluent in english although the hotel is within walking distance there is a building nearby where quite a number of homeless sleep overnight this may pose as a security risk we didn t run into any issues though the breakfast was so so with a very small selection some cold meats cheeses and biscuits no warm hot food
