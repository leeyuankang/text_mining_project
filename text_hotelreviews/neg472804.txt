i worry about the danger of the shower being located in the bath and the fact that there is a shower curtain rather than a solid glass door i had trouble adjusting the hot water to the right temperature for the shower i also couldn t work out how to open the safe using the given instructions otherwise all worked well for me price is a factor and this compares well with other hotels close by
