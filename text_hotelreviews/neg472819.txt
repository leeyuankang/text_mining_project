i stayed there for nights and i booked rooms there was no kettle in the rooms and when i asked for a hot water and i took only one english breakfast tea bag they charged me for euros which is not reasonable as the the whole pack is less than euros and it contains much more also there was insects that you can t see but it pinch in the room from the frist night so we couldn t sleep and i asked them for a spray for those insects they provided me but the problem was that it didn t kill those insects and we spent the nights almost without sleeping because of that
