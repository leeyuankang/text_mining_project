nevertheless location is far from perfect despite on the map you see it as near tangenziale it does not have straight way to it so you have to drive away minutes before you get to any civilization the hotel itself is surrounded by dull industrial zone the parking is euro per night but being located that far you expect the parking to be included in the price or free of charge the rooms need renovation we were a family of people in rooms and in both we experienced broken doors in douche not working lamps etc we also had broken lamellae of the additional sofa bed fixed by myself there is no kettle and tea coffee in the room and mini bar was extremely poor just two bottles of water breakfast is weak there was just scrambled and boiled eggs few types of sausage and very rare salad with no separate vegetables the next day of our stay the hotel was so crowded that one had to wait for even plates and cups for minutes the same about main dishes that is really not what you expect from hotel
