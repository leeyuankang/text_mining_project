very disappointed upon my arrival i was introduced in an uncleaned room and i had to complain about it in order to receive a new one the new one was ok but the overall condition of the room was of a low quality not of a star hotel dirty curtains stained carpet the walls made from plasterboard had hits and holes the bar was supposed to contain some food and beverage but it mere had bottles of water the breakfast was quite good but still hotel guys star hotel requires a certain level of professionalism and respect for customer you cannot serve from scraped plates and cups just get rid of them or replace them parking is paid apart euros per day city tax euro person day this was my first time in hotel idea san siro without knowing the conditions i booked in advance a room for different period of time now knowing this i cancelled the second booking
