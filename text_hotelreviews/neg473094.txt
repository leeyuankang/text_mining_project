we booked a room for three people and there was only a double bed in our room so we went to the reception to ask what was going on they promised us to bring an extra bed in an hour so we went for a walk when we came back in hours there still was nothing so we asked once again and they managed to solve this problem by am taking into consideration that we had to leave to the airport at we didn t have a rest no shampoo and shower gel in the room only for one person broken facilities see photos extra fee not stated in the booking for this mess we had to pay euro extra pro person so euro poor breakfast dirty walls
