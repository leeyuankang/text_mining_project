i liked nothing about this hotel you could not even compare it to to a highway motel the service was non existing the restaurant in the hotel was closed being a sunday the telephone was not working and the room was at the far end from the reception when my wife went down to inform the front desk the lady at the reception just shrugged to say she could not help her and so we had to go without food the next day we complained about the hot water in the bathroom and housekeeping told us to take the matter to the management which probably will arrive after we check out overall it would be beneath me to even rate this hotel as a one star
