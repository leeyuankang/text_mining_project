we went there to stay after a concert since the website mentions a free shuttle service from to san siro turned out the shuttle service was not free at all it was euro each value for money at least no that was to have only one small mini van that would travel back and forth from the stadium after the concert we had to wait on the street almost hours to get on the shuttle and we weren t the last group going back some people had to wait even more furthermore the travel was uncomfortable as we tried to get in as many people as possible so we were in an seats van the room was ok but it was impossible to switch the air con off and in the middle of the night we were freezing no blankets were available in the room so we had to sleep with our clothes on when we said so to the receptionist the next morning she said we should have opened the window to stop the air con as it is a system that can t be turned off manually i suggested to put a sign in the room or at least have blankets available she said we should have called them and they would have explained that to us i find it a ridiculous answer to give when i just told you i was awaken in the middle of the night by the cold no free wifi
