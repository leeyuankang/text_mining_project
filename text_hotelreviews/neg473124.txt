this hotel does not feel like a star hotel the staff was not trained the meal wasn t great everything outside the room felt disorganized and chaotic the restaurant was very slow and everything was micro managed by one person would only recommend for a very short stay the whole area around the hotel doesn t feel safe and is rather abandoned
