parking was way too expansive one member of the staff was particularly rude with the customers he was serving breakfast he s around keeping complaing out loud about people who were sitting in the wrong area of the restaurant asking them to change sit and tell em i don t know how to deal with this anymore even out loud i was quite embarrassed then snorting very frustrating this happened with me and other custumers i was commenting about his behaviour with others customers and we agreed that is not what you expect from a hotel the rest of the staff was adorable though
