do not book if you value time and money the hotel is about and half hours from the international airport the staff were completely unhelpful and the manager was downright argumentative the hotel was very expensive yet the aircondition in the entire building was not working no shuttle except for a couple of hours in the morning and again at evening and even when we could get the shuttle it was stated that there were too many of us a party of i booked this in a hurry as our accomodation got closed down the day before we travelled from paris so i did not have a great deal of time i looked at the information on the hotel page for booking com and booked this hotel that infoirmation was inaccurate the manager basically told me that all complaints would come to him so my complaining was useless
