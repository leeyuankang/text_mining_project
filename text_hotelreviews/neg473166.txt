as i checked in my room i found my wc not even flushed with everything that you can imagine and dog food in the dustbin i understand that i went in a busy period but that is definitely not an excuse to provide such a service i had to keep my phone charging in the end of the room as the plug couldn t fit in an electricity plug between two light switches in the middle of the bed s headboard i also find it very cheap of the hotel when you have to pay for the water when it s not provided with the room i found long blond hairs in the scrambled eggs on the breakfast buffet and the waiter that i reported to did t even seem to care about it it was just very frustrating to be in such conditions after a long day of work and meetings as the hotel is the only place where we should be comfortable during our travels big deception and yes the location is very far from everything there is no direct bus nor train that can take you to it from the center so you ll definitely have to grab a taxi if you re lucky to find one from the closest station that the public transportation could get you to it
