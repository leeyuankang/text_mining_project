breakfast was boring and basic and it reminded me of feeding time at the zoo you had to fight your way through hoards of school kids and people for a coffee half of what was out was empty and rarely refilled ie pastries also no cereal bowls for cereal the location is ridiculous don t bother i d say pay a little extra if you are in milan expect a huge whack on you bill before you leave city tax euro per person per night they also sell you bus tickets to catch the bus outside to san siro station they fail to tell you that because they are metres from the urban district area you will be fined by a bus inspector the inspector said that the tickets they sell are useless because the hotel is out of the area code we refused to pay the euro fine mind instead we were issued with euro fine to pay when back home to embassy the hotel never apologised rude staff instead simply said don t pay it then
