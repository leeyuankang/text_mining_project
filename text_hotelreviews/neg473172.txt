this hotel doesn t value stars you can see it in many details the rooms should be refreshed for example the carpet in the room was quite dirty in the first room where we were placed the window didn t close so we were moved to another room which was more spicious which is good but the question is why they don t give to the guests better free rooms from the beginning the hall downstairs was very cold while in the room it was too hot during the breakfast the staff forbid you to use the trays even though they re placed right in the middle of the breakfast room for the staff use only but it s not written anywhere we had a small child so the tray was very usefull to facilitate our breakfast anyway it s a small detail but it s strange attitude for stars hotel
