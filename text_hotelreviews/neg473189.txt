the hotel is located in a very desert area there s nothing close to it and i wouldn t even walk alone in that district the public transport was good but we had to travel nearly one hour to rech the city center the room was fine but the bed cover and the seats were stained and looked dirty this could all be okay but we had only lukewarm cold water in the bathroom so it was really hard to have a shower we asked for maintenance but the water was still cold so they tried to give us another room but the hotel was full and the only room free had only cold water too in the bathroom at the end they gave us eur discount but if i could choose i had better had hot water the breakfast was low quality for bread they served only some sliced baguettes and nothing else and it was also dry if you want a comfortable and relaxing stay i do not recommend this hotel also for this money it was really bad we had better rent an apartmann somewhere in milan
