the hotel is well away from any facilities there are no restaurants or bars nearby the courtesy shuttle bus wasn t running the weekend we were there it is a minute bus ride from hotel to the san siro metro where there are shops restaurants bars nearby the the last bus leaves the metro just after no taxi stand at the metro station so had to order a uber the hotel sells bus metro tickets but they ran out on the sunday we knew the restaurant was not open on a sunday night fine but did not expect the bar to be closed too disappointing
