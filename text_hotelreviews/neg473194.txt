online a lots of beautiful pictures about this hotel but the reallity it s is not a good place for an hotel of stars online there is one adress that say it s the place of the hotel but we went by walk to the hotel and that wasn t the good adress it was fake and when i read more one mail from the hotel it says if you have to put the gps on your phone you have to put an other adress very weird then it took us hours to get from central station mila to there then there is no service like taxi shuttle for customer you just have bus metro the room wasn t the same like on booking there are nothing around the hotel it s kind of desert it s definitly not a hotel with stars
