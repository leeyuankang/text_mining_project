we checked in after and the bar was closed even though it stated open for hours only beer was available we booked a double room but only got one set of towels and toiletries the pillows were hard the bathroom fan stayed on all night i ended up lying awake all night as the lights from the tv ac and smoke alarm kept blinking the tv wasn t working properly the bathroom had hairs in the sink and on the floor not the cleanest bathroom wifi only worked on one device breakfast was like eating in a pigsty and if you weren t having fruit the rest was awful powdered eggs more fat than actual bacon nothing looked fresh boiled eggs were hard and cold even though kept in food warmer the entire area was filthy we had to clean our own eating area upon entering the breakfast room there was no direction or signs or human to advise where the cutlery was or where to order a decent coffee staff were very unfriendly and rude if you didn t speak italian everything was artificial foodwise i would not recommend it leaving was as much a nightmare deciding to leave earlier to find a decent breakfast we had to wait min before we could leave the parking lot because of the way the parking area is operated by one man who was anything but friendly euros for parking isn t that much but when i have to wait to get my car out of the parking i object add euro city tax per person and it adds up to a waste of time and money spent overall we weren t event asked if everything was satisfactory when handing in the card key staff were too busy chatting amongst themselves there was no one at the counter so to say they were too busy with other guests rather stay elsewhere
