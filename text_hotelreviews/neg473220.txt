staff was not helpful asked for more towels in the room and never came asked receptionist to book us a taxi and replied that it s not their duty to do so and gave me a number where to call this incident happened twice in the same stay asked to have some croissants at the breakfast promised that they are supplying soon but never turned up really and truly we were happy staying there coz it s nice and close to san siro stadium but staff ruined it all from top to bottom
