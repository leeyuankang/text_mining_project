on the site it s advertised there s free shuttle service to milan but when we went we were told this wasn t available which was a big reason why we chose this hotel moreover the restaurant isn t all that great food selection is small and the waiters even forgot to get our food for us so we waited over hours for food the pizza i ordered was very soggy definitely not a star restaurant
