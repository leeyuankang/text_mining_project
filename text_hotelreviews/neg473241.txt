when we were looking somewhere to book quickly as we were stuck in milan with a flat tyre we looked this up and it looked nice from the photos when we turned up the surroundings were not what we expected as it was tucked away in the middle of no where and not in a good way we checked in with no problems though other guests seemed to have problems this should have been a warning we got to our room and it looked very basic but the first big problem was when i went to the bathroom and i then got stuck with much force i got the door open but i didn t try it again that was when i started to look properly the phone was unplugged and had no numbers or buttons there was no pictures on the walls just holes and screws to where there used to be a picture the menus or any useful information was missing and the door off the shower was falling off never mind the bugs that kept flying in my partner went down to request another room to which they apologised and gave us another room my partner checked the other room and because of the shape of the room it was only half the size when something is wrong with your first room i didn t appreciate a smaller room we went down again and they gave us another room this room now had a window that wouldn t shut and not wanting to repeat the incident of bugs flying in we went down again they then sent someone up to fix that window all whilst this was happening i had to stay in the original room as we had two dogs with us and found it unfair to take them room to room with all of our luggage and this original room no had no electricity as they had deactivated the key and room nothing was compensated and there wasn t really an apology to the fact that we had to change rooms three times all rooms seemed to be different or have something missing so i was extremely disappointed and will be writing a email of complaint to the hotel directly
