i arrived there after a long way and was very tired i was very happy to get into my room but the room was very hot and air consitioner did not work there was no toalet paper in the bathroom and telefon did not work so i could not reach out the receptionist the girl at the reception was quite rude she told me that it was actually my fault that i could not start the airconditioner i asked to change the room i got new key but the lock did not work the staff did not appologize at all i dont know if its lack of english or just an italian way to treat customers i will not stay at this hotel again for sure
