we received a very good deal on this hotel so it makes it difficult to criticize but here are few points despite the hotel looked very modern taps in bathrooms in two different rooms were very loose making it difficult to get warm water in one one of the rooms the position of the hotel wrt the centre of milan is far from ideal the frequency of the public transport from the last metro station tram station at the stadium of san siro to the hotel is not very high the advertised shuttle was not operating during our stay it takes about an hour to get from the hotel to the center and you need to make sure not miss your bus
