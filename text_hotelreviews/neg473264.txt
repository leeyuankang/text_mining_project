one of the worst hotel i have ever seen no cattle iron hairdryer is not working i requesting some ice to make compresses to my child they answered no we don t have i requested a cattle to prepare some tea they answered rudely not available the breakfast is so poor bread and cakes the location is out of nowhere in the middle of industrial zone far from the center with minutes with the car the staff need a lot of training how to deal with the guests they seems to be not caring if you are satisfied or not the room is full of mosquitos and flies parking costs you euro per night and you have to check the kiosk every time you come out the parking i strongly not recommending this hotel for any one
