breakfast is given as and the most annoying thing was being told as we were eating breakfast finished rather rudely with no pre warning at about and finding out the coffee machine etc all turned off and staff standing over us trying to get us to leave my rather slow eater year old was pretty put out she couldn t finish all her co co pops was also pretty annoying at the breakfast as we got there about and the croissants ran out just as we got there and there wasn t much bread left either strange as loads of cake cheese salami etc that no one was really eating but hardly any bread croissants why not swop cakes for a few more croissants lack of proper coffee and proper juice the lay out of breakfast also quite strange and frustrating eg milk miles away from the cereal and spoons miles away from them only had pillows and towels for of us a little bit tired looking round the edges but fine for the price
