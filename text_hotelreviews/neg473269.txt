i choose this hotel only because before booking i read that they have free shuttle to airport after booking there was written that shuttle is for additional cost when i arrived to hotel i found out that shuttle buss starts only from so beware that this hotel thinks that peoples don t fly in the mornings taxi from hotel to airport we found out from reception that it costs euros and to get from hotel to airport in the morning it s huge problem because you need choose multiple metros trains buses my advice for everyone who travels without car choose hotel which is in center because there from central station you can find shuttle for normal money also in hotel room there was very weird unpleasant smell left window open all night and still it didn t came out
