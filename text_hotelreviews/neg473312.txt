difficult to reach with public transport only one bus line the hotel looks worn out and run down food in the local restaurant was really bad and expensive breakfast was not included and wifi cost eur for a day which works only for one device and sometimes the access code gets invalid and you have to ask the reception for a new one all in all one of the worst hotels i have stayed in i can t fathom how they can have more than stars
