it seems churlish to find fault with the windsor hotel but the only thing that i can think of is the lack of a computer for the guests to use oh and a perennial complaint from a british perspective the lack of tea making facilities in the room both things that will only apply to a tiny fraction of the hotel s guests i m sure
