i want to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the service i received during my stay in windsor hotel although it s a four star hotel the things that they allow themselves to do towards their guests are absolutely disrespectful they don t deserve even a one star i was woken up early in the morning a m by the sound of a hammer and then a heavy drill what a wonderful beginning of the day being on vocation at the reception desk i was informed that there was nothing to complain about they are sorry but there was just a complete reconstruction of rooms in their hotel and this persistent sound would continue from a m till p m i was offered a room on the upper floor but does it make sense the sound was everywhere since it was not like changing a picture from one place to another one it was a complete reconstruction is it fair to your guests being put in front of the fact of waking up every morning at with such a pleasant sound of the knocking hammer and the drill leaving no other options if it was possible on booking com i would attach the video with this terrible sound so you could feel it they asked me to give them my credit card for a guarantee when i was checking in and having no idea what i m going to deal with in such cases i would like to take the credit card of windsor hotel and ask them to compensate my spoiled holiday and their unbearable service luckily my bad experience in this hotel lasted for days but i felt so sorry for people who had a longer stay or guests with small children i saw a couple of other guests at the reception desk who were interested in what was going on to my mind respectful hotels which do care about their reputation will never force their guests to go through this stress and sufferings on vocation these respectful hotels do close for a period of reconstruction in order not to disturb their clients and open again when everything is ready
