we ate twice at the adjacent restaurant clothilde once for lunch and once for breakfast we found the staff arrogant and unhelpful we arrived at noon and took a seat at the front window and ordered from the menu on the table after our order was placed a different server informed us the eggs could not be cooked anymore and said i should order from the lunch menu and handed me one i asked if i could order another muesli and yogurt instead since that order was accepted already and a coffee he said okay and left after some time only one order of muesli and one coffee was served we told our waiter that we had ordered two of each and he left some minutes later he returned with a smaller bowl with a tiny amount a yogurt and a pile of cornflakes no muesli at that point we gave up finished our coffees paid the bill and left our second experience was at the breakfast buffet provided to hotel guests between am to am in general the buffet offering was satisfactory to good the one complaint we had was the coffee served from an thermal dispenser was scorched and virtually undrinkable though we did not complain about the coffee once again we found the staff aloof and arrogant not warm and welcoming our booking com reservation indicated a welcome drink upon arrival we arrived a am after an international flight and the front desk asked us to wait until pm fortunately the hotel as able to provide a room by pm but never offered or informed us about the beverage on arrival lastly we found rm was somewhat dark it had a view over the lobby roof looking across to hotel rooms on the other wing even with the blinds drawn during the daytime there was little direct sun exposure
