we booked a junior suite for our first night of honeymoon and informed the hotel when booking in january we felt the room we were given was not a junior suite and when we went to reception to ask about it the man was quite rude and promised us this is one of their best rooms there are two styles of room as we can now see from photos so do not expect the modern grey style as you may receive the other more traditional red style no photos of the room we had are on booking com i would honestly definitely not book a standard room if what we had was considered a suite a small room two twin beds pushed together very standard bathroom however after leaving the hotel and looking at more photos from other travellers i still feel we did not stay in a suite nowhere to sit other than one desk chair single sink and small shower bath felt no luxury in any way do not book this hotel for a special occasion i e honeymoon birthday anniversary as they do not care you are simply another guest a real shame as we were very excited about this stay will not be returning and will definitely not recommend
