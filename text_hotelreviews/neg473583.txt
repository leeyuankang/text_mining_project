the staff spoke very little english while i understand i was in a foreign country it was our first hotel after a long day of travel i looked for hotels who spoke english to try and avoid frustration also we arrived around pm and they wouldn t accommodate an early check in even though the room was ready i know it s not required but i believe it s a nice gesture
