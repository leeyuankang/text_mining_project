my stay there was terrible for only one reason my room was on the floor faced to the street to be precise corner of streets where lines of tram are passing by and making terrible noice so it was almost impossible to sleep they have very nice rooms but they didn t invest in proper windows which protect from the noice and they must do it because of their position
