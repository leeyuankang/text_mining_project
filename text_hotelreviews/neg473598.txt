breakfast wasn t delivered to the room even when the selection menu was hung on the door before the night before as said on the leaflet it meant i then had to ring reception in the morning ask where it was then speak to the kitchen to order again and i was nearly late for an interview when i wanted room service the night before it was even worse i had to go down to the restaurant and wait to order bizarre the whole point was that i wanted to relax in my room with dinner and not go down to the very busy restaurant in my tracksuit bottoms and trainers it was ridiculous it should definitely not say room service on list of amenities heating was not turned off when i rang reception i had to ring again because it became so hot in the room
