the noise from the trams the hotel sits on a corner and the tram brakes are very loud there is a respite between around midnight and we requested a quiet room but there cant have been any left the free mini bar is only bottles of water and a can of soft drink each and whilst this was appreciated it is a little misleading there are no tea and coffee making facilities its not on the facilities info but i had assumed there would be perhaps this is the norm in italy and the coffee was very good in the bar bathroom doors are sliding and ours stuck shut a few times we reported it and were offered a room change so good response there
