this hotel was a huge disappointment from the beginning the receptionist during our check in gave us the worst welcome that we could get seriously he is by far the worst receptionist i ve ever seen the first thing that he asked was a credit card for guarantee and when i told him that i do not have a credit card with me but i was prepared to pay everything he wished by cash immediately he told me by quote that without a credit card it was not possible to do the check in seriously then he realized probably his mistake after we get mad and he told us that suddenly everything was ok and that we can pay on the check out i have to mentioned that during our nights stay none of the receptionist gave us a single hello or a goodnight when we passed in front of them it was the first time we felt so unwanted and unwelcome the other thing that i have to mention is that the room that they gave us room had such a disgusting smelly and dirty carpet that it was not possible to walk without shoes and i wonder why a star hotel can not change this awful carpet
