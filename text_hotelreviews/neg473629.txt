room does not match the pictures on booking com our room was very dull with no sunlight in room it was also too hot for us air conditioning switched off for winter when it was outside and inside no fans in room staff suggested to open the windows but noise from tram running on street was too much we ended up leaving the room with windows open and returned only late at night when it was deg inside just ok to sleep
