i live in nyc so i m used to outside noise but this was ridiculous the room faced the street and the tram bus was very noisy passing and stopping every few minutes the sound of metal screeching and doors opening and closing it only stopped running from about the rooms do not look like what is advertised on booking com either booking com or the hotel is not marketing well the hotel website is deceiving too i was disappointed to see my room it was old and very small but it was for only one night so i went with it the shower was clean but tiny i m and i bumped my elbow on the door trying to wash my hair another con was that there was only outlet no outlets in the bathroom the outlet that was there was broken because it was not the correct size it we obvious people had tried to plug in their devices and it busted maybe the other rooms are nicer but my experience indicated a star hotel at best
