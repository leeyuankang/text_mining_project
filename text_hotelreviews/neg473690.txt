we arrived in milan airport at am and we reached the hotel at around am we couldn t be more tired i asked the hotel for an early check in but they told me that they can t guarantee as it depends on the room availability we booked a junior suit when we reached our room was not ready and the check in time is meanwhile we decided to go take a look at the duomo area and have breakfast till our room gets ready we returned to the hotel at am the staff at the reception was really aggressive and not coaperating we were so tired and so sleepy as we didn t sleep the whole flight and he keeps asking us to wait till at that time i was so upset of how rude the receptionist was so i started looking at booking for a different hotel and i think he saw me therefore and hour and a half later they upgraded us to a suite with the same price of the junior suite which was nice of them thats what made me forgive them otherwise i was gonna change the hotel because of their attitude
