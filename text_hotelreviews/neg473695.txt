breakfast was chaotic not enough space for all the guests and the people who came to eat the store togheter we had to wait minutes to get a coffee and a cappuccino when we finally got them the waiter brought cappuccinos the finish in the rooms could have been better especially in the bathroom a little touch of silicone here and there wouldn t kill anybody all togheter worth it s price and we would definitly go back or recommend it to friends who would take a trip to milan
