unfortunately the parking was euros for an overnight stay which i thought was a bit steep it was also a little confusing as we had to drive to a separate car park across the road which is affiliated with the hotel and leave the car keys with the guys there this wasn t explained and we didn t feel terribly comfortable doing this the hotel assured me this was ok on picking up the car it had damage a scuff to the right passenger side bumper luckily we saved ourselves a headache by having full insurance with the hire company but i d be cautious of letting them park my car again
