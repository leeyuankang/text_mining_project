whenever you came from outside to the hotel the corridor and the room had a disgusting smell and it made me dizzy the staff in the reception was polite but didn t give me a welcome feeling he only showed his kindness when we checked out it seems that the hotel has a manpower management issue i hardly see smile faces in both reception and cafeteria area i would say the room rate is stars hotel price but not the services
