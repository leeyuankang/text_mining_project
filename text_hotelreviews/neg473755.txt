the only drawbacks which are minor ones i see that when requesting an iron for my cloth they said it was not allowed in the rooms to have an iron and i can iron my cloth down in the reception which is non convenient the second issue is that they have three steps in the reception that they can make a ramp for them as for strollers and wheeled chaired persons this is non convenient other than that it was a great stay
