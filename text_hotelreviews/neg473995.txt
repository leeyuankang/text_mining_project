even though the time of my visit was during the most important exhibition for furniture in milan the guest who pays euros plus city tax euros for days expect at least to receive the minimum service corresponding to that money on the contrary what i received was the following nobody cared if i am a gold spg member or not no discussion for upgrade of course it was impossible to have a shower in the morning as you were either freezing or burning the executive room which i booked is rather the smallest standard room of another hotel if you want to have a fresh orange juice or an omelette in the breakfast you have to pay and euros accordingly otherwise you get a cheap liquid which has the flavor and the color of the orange juice don t forget that we are talking for a star hotel the sheets were changed in days just once although they have complimentary coffee in the room they leave you only one small bottle of water free then you have to be charged so you can have only one cup of coffee and few sips of water the breakfast room is in the basement which have no windows i made the mistake to arrive at hrs and i had to wait hours to get the room they respect what they inform you when booking and they keep repeating saying that when somebody complains the rooms are very dark with very less sunlight and with very old furniture in general any traveler has to avoid staying in that hotel for the same money i have stayed in the past in much better hotels as for instance the la gare hotel which is very close to the four points sheraton i had stayed in the la gare last year but i decided to stay in four points sheraton given that i am a gold spg member a mistake which i will never repeat
