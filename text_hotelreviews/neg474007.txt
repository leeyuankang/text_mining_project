the location of the hotel is only so so i expected it to be located much closer to the city center and all the tourist attractions also there is no smoking area inside so you have to stand in front of the hotel with no protection from the rain to smoke watch out for pickpockets there are quite a few of them close to the hotel so avoid bad streets that are badly lit
