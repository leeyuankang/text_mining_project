inside the lobby is ok it s nice but not as nice as other hotels the gardens or little courtyard is amazing but in milan unless it s summer weather doesn t really allow for outdoor sitting also a cup of tea is soooo unless you have free breakfast don t plan on eating there also scoop of gelato is just way overpriced i feel like i would have perfected a cooler interior hotel while i enjoyed my gelato and tea
