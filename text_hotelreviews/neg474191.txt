it was not explained neither on booking com nor by hotel staff what options exist for free parking there is some space in front of hotel that may be used for free as well but as the night receptionist said it does not belong to hotel and hotel has its own parking that costs eur per day in reality t seems that there is a lot of space in nearby non residential streets as well and there is an option to have night parking for free in the street watt as well breakfast offer was somewhat worse then in other italian stars hotels coffee was good no balcony nor city view we did not ask explicitly for in order to use wi fi one has to provide personal data and to watch commercials the explanation of hotel staff is that it is vodafone s policy however in other italian hotels we visited there is no such violation of privacy or at least it was lesser than here city tax too big but that is an issue of milano and not the hotel
