it s not the first time i booked at this hotel but it will be probably the last when i arrived late at night a scruffy receptionist couldn t find my booking i got a voucher with a booking number the shower was not working and i had been promised a change of room for the following day that did not happen the very following morning i talked to the receptionist that was polite but clearly not trained eventually they had me showering in another room while a clueless handyman was trying to repair the shower no aircon i had been told that the mayor of milan forbids conditioning in may when i tried to drive away the gate got blocked and again this poor handyman tried his best on top of everything apparently in all the hotel there is not a working pressing iron to be given to the guests i used to love this place but it looks to me that nobody cared about it
