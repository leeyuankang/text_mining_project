the pub in front of the street is very noisy and unfortunately my room wasn t soundproofed they charged on my card the first night one day before the deadline specified on booking fair enough no problem but when i booked on booking website it was clearly specified both in the hotel policies and in price details data sheet that there would not be any prepayment and no deposit would be charged
