we booked this place for a businesstrip to milan although we booked a double bed we got twin beds but that was not the problem the problem is what you get for eur dirty beds the very small room fitted with a carpet that now is gray dirty room walls and ceilings across the street is a bar which plays loud music till in the morning at the car park my rental car was damaged at the mirror my wife wanted a comb as she forgott her brush this house had no comb available for guests only the breakfast was good
