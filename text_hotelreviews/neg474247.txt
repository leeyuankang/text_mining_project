the aircon was working very poorly it wasn t possible to set the tempuratur by our self only the receptionist was able to change the tempuratur and it wasn t as low as we could wish the receptionist spoke very little english and therefor it was very difficult to ask about eg the local transportation or recomandations about resturants we had to log on to the wifi every time we would use it
