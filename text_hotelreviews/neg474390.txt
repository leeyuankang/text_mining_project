elevators were the worst they are super slow and at any time there s elevator traffic you have to wait very long for it on friday there was an event and it was impossible to use the elevator we opted for stairs several times we booked hotel partly because it has nice rooftop terrace after we couldn t get an elevator to go up there we had to take the stairs and discovered that it didn t work nice view no bar though breakfast only had warm choices it s only a star hotel i know but i have stayed at star with far better breakfast variety
