we found the food in the restaurant was a bit fussy overpriced and just ok it was a shame that there was no iron in the room as the cost to have garments ironed was very expensive and this should have been an additional facility available in the room we would also have used the spa much more if it was open in the morning we were also disappointed that the terrace bar was not open as we would have spent more time in the hotel enjoying evening drinks
