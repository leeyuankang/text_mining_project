stay away from this place on my last trip to milan attracted by the sofitel brand i made the mistake of staying in this lousy hotel the hotel has a rooftop bar frequented by very unpleasant people who used to circulate drunk on the halls pressing all the elevator buttons when going away to complete the horror of those days i was robbed in the lobby by the time of check out someone stole my brown backpack with all my travel memories plus camera tablet etc i made a denuncia di furto at the police station in linate airport but the hotel refused to pay for any damages claiming that i did not have that brown backpack lagare hotel milano centrale is a real tourist trap it was the worst hotel i stayed in in years of world travel if you think of going to milan forget this option
