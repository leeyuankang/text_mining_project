this hotel was a huge disappointment it was the most expensive in a week holiday all other hotels we stayed at were accurate to the description and room rate except this hotel it listed an outdoor terrace bar that gave great views of milan sadly both nights we tried to get access it was closed for private functions we were told we could sit at the bar on of the nights but would have to move when asked there was also another outdoor lobby bar which was also closed for a private function on of the nights a swimming pool loungers etc was also listed but this was in fact a spa which cost to enter when we spoke the manager marco we were told this was a booking com translation error he seemed unable to grasp that the facilities that they boasted were not actually available to their guests marco did little to appease us except offer a free spa that we did not want
