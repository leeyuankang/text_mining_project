the breakfast was a shambles staff were overrun and struggling to cope there was no water coffee half of the food was finished and very slow to be replaced location of things was a bit awkward and not explained to us there were separate stations spread across the room so people were walking up and down the room constantly we noticed people were starting to complain so decided to leave and avoid the controversy this was a real let down for us considering we had to pay more to have the breakfast included
