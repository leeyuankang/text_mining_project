booking com need to give clear directions to this hotel following the small map would only make sense with a description of which doors and street to use to exit the station we were allocated a room better suited to disabled guests with a shower and plastic curtain and no shelf space for makeup water bottles were only provided on the first day and the wellness center is expensive there are only two main elevators serving twelve floors this is not adequate especially when the hotel allows private functions leaving paying guests resorting to the stairwell when we finally made it up to the roof top terrace for a quiet drink we found it overcrowded and the noisy private group took most of the tables the breakfast staff should have checked with reception before we were accused of not prepaying for it an apology was only offered after we took up the issue with management based on previous mcgallery experiences i fail to see how this hotel qualifies
