we had an overbooking for two weeks there were two rooms reserved under the same name while this was obviously a mistake the hotel never mentioned this until we checked out and forced us to pay for both rooms the roof terrace restaurant is bad and overpriced i ordered a glass of red wine and received a glass of almost boiling cabernet the bottle was obviously stored in the sun when i complained the waitress told me that red wine isn t supposed to be cold and offered me to put a bottle on ice she did not take the wine back and charged us euros for the litres of red wine and euros for a small beer rip off
