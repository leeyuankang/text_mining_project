reception staff unfriendly abrupt initially tried to tell us we weren t booked in despite us showing them our booking confirmation email spa doesn t open until not sure why and because we had evening plans the nights we were there we missed out on using spa which we had intended to use morning or afternoon the spa facilities had been the main factor in choosing this hotel we didn t get to use it the waiting staff on the roof top terrace bar were terrible it took mins to be served then our drinks juices didn t arrive after another minutes so we left a conference party had arrived the staff weren t interested in us we weren t impressed at all we would try another hotel if we go back to milan
