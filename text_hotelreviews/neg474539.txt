breakfast was not that good mainly because of poor coffee you don t expect this sort of coffee in italy especially in a star hotel we only had breakfast there once if you do not necessarily need eggs and bacon check out many cafes nearby for wonderful coffee and pastry much better and cheaper another issue was decorative pillows on the bed i am pretty sure they caused severe allergy for me on a third night i removed them far away from the bed and it was better if you have allergies be aware i suggest the hotel staff to take this seriously and check those pillows and the rooms in general for allergies some people might have very strong allergic reactions
