euro went missing during our stay the hotel did their best and checked the security tapes and room log but no evidence could be found of any wrong doing given that i had withdrawn the money just a few hours previously and that i then got changed to go to the gym there really is very little chance the money was mislaid elsewhere the hotel were very helpful but ultimately their comment of course we believe you i could only excuse on the basis that perhaps their english wasn t very good either way if you re staying here just use the safe a bit more than you normally would perhaps the rooms are a little smaller than they appear in the literature but overall it s such good value that there is not reason to complain
