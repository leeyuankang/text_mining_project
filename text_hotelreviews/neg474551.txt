i frequently travel to big conurbation like paris new york tokyo and other but it was my only time i was visiting milan as everybody knows the standard of the hotel has nothing common with the number of stars in this case we were seduced by the good opinions probably from the hotel personnel despite the fact that the hotel was almost empty not very friendly receptionist offered us a room on the floor with a small window overlooking the dustbin and the office building very close to the hotel facade we have to close the curtains during the day but first we were hesitating to take the room almost on the ground afraid of the noise from the street but the receptionist told us that other room will be prepared in ours she did not look convincing as we did not want to waste time we took the keys we had to carry our luggage ourselves to the room not very far but still it supposed to be star hotel despite passing next to the reception several times during the stay staff was not interested in the guests too much not even once we ve heard good morning toilet acted reluctantly and water barely flowed from the shower even though the rooms had to be sound proof everything from the room next door was audible location of the hotel is rather average and for the money it was offered you can find much better hotels in milano not recommended
