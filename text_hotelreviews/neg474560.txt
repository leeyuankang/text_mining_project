full of disappointment staying in this hotel we were shocked to find out that there was feces in the toilet when we entered the room the steamed bathing room was originally a good design but it kept dripping water which made us could not sleep at night the lighting effect on the wall of the building was disturbing which forced us to close the curtain arrangement for breakfast was messy with limited food staff were not really helpful with no smile on their faces except when we checked out we did not enjoy our nights stay at all
