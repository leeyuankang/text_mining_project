the one and only disappointment we had was that the room did not have an iron upon calling the front desk we were told that the hotel does not have an iron ironing board available and the only option was to have our clothes ironed by the hotel at a garment this facility is nice to have but it would also be useful for a hotel to have an ironing board with iron that is available to use also
