they charge your for every little step spa is extra per person breakfast is per person and honestly it s not worth it at all very average food no variety and they didn t have lactose free milk unacceptable for an upscale hotel like that so i couldn t even have my morning coffee and all this with the fact that we had a junior suite nothing was included and the room itself was very average ah and they have a tiny garage which is of course fully booked and the only place you can leave your car is the parking nearby for a day when checking out they didn t even ask us how was our stay fair enough
