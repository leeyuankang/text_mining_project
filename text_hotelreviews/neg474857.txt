arrived after as planned and communicated only one person at desk minute line when i get to the counter i inquire about parking it s euros a day but i see a huge empty parking lot in front of the property i ask about the parking lot the receptionist tells me that it s free but car windows are routinely smashed during the night however they take no responsibility even if you pay them to park in their secluded area i park my car in the empty lot for free then queue up for check in again while i m waiting a lady in a definitely non pleased state of mind joins and then cuts the line she explains that she was sleeping and a stranger entered her room the stranger was then waiting a few meters behind with his luggage he d been assigned the lady s room the receptionist apologizes somewhat sternly and proceeds to find another room for the gentleman while making no attempt to make up for the mistake the lady goes back to her room promising to write suitable reviews i am kind of waiting to read that i finally check in and get a room i find it and enter there s nobody sleeping but there s a suitcase a backpack and a pair of sunglasses also one of the towels had been used i go back to the reception and join the long line for the third time when my turn comes the lady apologizes again wonder if she noticed a pattern there and gives me a new room this time it appears to be empty obviously no upgrade or anything for me either the rooms look nice and spacious however they are not sound proof by any stretch of the imagination every time someone is walking on the corridor the sound of their steps their luggage and their conversation echoes through the room the minibar had a working light but no refrigeration beverages were at room temperature probably not going back
