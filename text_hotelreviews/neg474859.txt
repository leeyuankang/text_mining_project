second time at barcelo and second disaster experience in order parking is not present and you need to park in a near abandoned parking arrived at reception i found a very cold and not helpful receptionist once in the camera lights were not working and also air conditioning was blocked assistance came after long time and in an arrogant way pretended the problems were not there elevators are simply a nightmare you can loose ages of time before your elevator arrives check out is done by maximum persons with very long and annoying queue all in all i do not recommend barcelo hotel no matter they may have an offer this place is simply a nightmare it is useless to pretend to be stars and then work unefficiently and uneffectively
