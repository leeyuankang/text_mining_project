the staff were a little condescending at times although it depends because others were very nice and accommodating i think they re marketed as higher scale and i guess i didn t appear like a typical client the interior decorating wasn t to my taste it is very niche but i bet if you enjoy mod inspired contemporary art you won t mind my room looked like something out of the jetsons the veiw however is truly awful the sky deck is overlooking train lines hideous corporate buildings and what looked like abandoned warehouse buildings i suspect the area is in development and in a few years it may have more visual appeal my bed was rock solid so if you re into a firm mattress this is the place for you
