room temperature was too hot we called the reception but still they couldn t control the room temperature we booked the hotel to use pool but when we went to the hotel they told us pool was closed very dissapointed and they only run one shuttle bus for people so for people traveling in large groups it s a waste as the shuttle bus would always be not available
