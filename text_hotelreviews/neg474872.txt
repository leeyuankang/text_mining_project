the location is just bordering on inconvenient it helps that they have a shuttle service but this has limited hours and while there is a bus station that is walking distance away in principle it involves walking through a dark and scary underpass to get to it not everyone will be happy with that at the hotel itself my biggest minus would be the absence of bath tubs the shower stall was interestingly designed but i still wish there was a bath tub finally the elevators you would think that the design would make for more efficient shuttling of hotel guests you select your floor before entering but the absence of indicators as to which floor the lift is already at means that you have no idea when your lift will arrive normally this would not be a problem but when there is a huge conference and lots of people are checking in or out the wait can become downright infernal i was waiting for seriously almost fifteen minutes before a lift got to me at the floor because of a big convention and it didn t help not knowing what floor the lift was already at
