i have booked the hotel because it is close to fi re milano that i was supposed to visit but it is soooooo far from the center that u feel like you are not in milano any more and the district around is so weird that i preferred to don t go out of the hotel by myself more than that in the description it was stated that hotel is prividing free transfer to fi re milano in reality they just bring u to the nearest metro the spa one on the reasons i took barcelo was spa the spa was not free it costs per person but it was so cold inside that it was not possible to swim in the pool and then relax on the sunbed it was freezing so u can t enjoy the spa really i arrived to the hotel around at around i asked the reception if i can eat smth and no the restaurant is closed till and there nothing to eat in the bar stars i asked for the iron because i needed to iron my clothes they opened me some back room and i had to iron my staff there among boxes and whatever in general this hotel is too expensive for what u get
