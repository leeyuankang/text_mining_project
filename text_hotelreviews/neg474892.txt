martino receptionist who checked us in wasn t nice at all quite rude actually room was dirty cleaning standards extremely poor and you wouldn t expect that after reading all of the reviews shower floor and walls discussing heated swimming pool with the dirtiest walls i ve even seen you could scratch the dirt with your finger after you walk in nothing seems to be wrong but after looking closer you ll know that the spa area isn t clean regularly staff in general very arrogant and can t speak english what makes it worst as they would serve you different things than you have ordered of menu more expensive one hotel ordered a taxi for us in departure and we have paid extra for the same distance as day earlier plus they ve promised driver would leave us in the right place but he didn t so we had to walk another after he left and almost missed our bus for the airport do not order room service unless they have investigated and changed all the food trays see pics
