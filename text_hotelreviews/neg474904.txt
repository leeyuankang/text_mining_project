the neighbourhood is terrible basically the hotel is in the middle of old industrial site there are still lots of abandoned warehouses or plants near also the railroad and the highway not a pleasant view the hotel could compensate this with a great atmosphere and facilities but this just does not happen because of poor management i guess having a terrace with a view on the floor and not even providing even a seating not even fixing a broken floorboard leave alone creating a hour bar which really must be there is just inexcusable getting down to a second terrace on a or so floor was even a better experience the doors only open to outside and you are left on a completely empty terrace more like a building site and have to figure out how to get back in the hotel overall the hotel looks and feels deserted you have to go to that enormous reception hall just to find some people but the only open facility you can find is a very small bar no choice of beers even not one that you know only the hotel brand almost no food high prices not adequate to quality and service also why did i end up exploring the hotel in the evening basically because i was travelling with a friend and they have this designer shower and bathroom right in the middle of the room surely the shower glass is opaque but anyway you have to step out of it directly to the room just to take a towel no hooks and not even a door to the shower and you have to travel two steps to adjust the temperature how do i know what the temperature is if i m two steps away that s just silly also i m reflected in all the mirrors in the room while doing that and in the morning i have to brush my teeth literally within reach of my sleeping friend s face thanks god they ve placed toilet in the separate space can t be locked though and windows are dirty
