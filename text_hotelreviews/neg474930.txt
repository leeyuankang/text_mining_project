the elevators can only be booked in advance and there s only three of them for a floors hotel therefore one can wait up to minutes before getting an elevator the spa is only accessible in the afternoon and there is no way to use the swimming pool after pm very uncomfortable tha parking has to be paid separately per night and the only cash machine was not working the food at the restaurant is fine although the restaurant itself is pretty noisy
