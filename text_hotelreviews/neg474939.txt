biggest disappointment was the restaurant atmosphere with terrible echoing acoustics and kids running all over from the adjacent kids club with no gate the modern decor became a playground for them and we were surrounded by chaos and forgotten by servers our entire meal we left early food was good but atmosphere felt as we were in a mall food court by the kids play area also there is an amazing moden looking jacuzzi area that is deserted since only spa clients can use but it was pointless because they don t keep the water warm and the sauna didn t work the treatment in the spa was so so and when the amenities aren t in working order the spa treatment was less of a value not too convenient to downtown milan or train from airport without taxis or longer train rides involved
