poor wifi connection very unstable connections dropping off on constantly and requires re log in all the time it is highly frustrated when we r trying to book our train tickets and other hotels online i can t stop swearing of the stupid connections poor business centre facility unhelpful staff the printer was broken in the business center and we can not print the train tickets and hotel bookings ourselves have to send all bookings to the concierge to get them printed people on the front desk are not helpful and we have to wait for nearly an hour to get things sorted which would only takes minutes if the printer is good poor shuttle services to world expo the hotel provides free shuttle bus to the milan world expo but we could never catch the bus back to the hotel partially due to the day the staff informed us about a wrong pick up address and the day the poor organisation of world expo italian people tends to make everything unnecessarily complicated especially their transportation system poor value for money for the amount of money we paid we r expecting much better service yet we found that we r only dreaming wil not recommend this hotel to anyone unfortunately
