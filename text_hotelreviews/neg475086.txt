the location of this hotel isn t great it s a trek to get to the centre of milan and is a little too far out there is a market outside the hotel on a saturday which leaves so much mess that they re cleaning into the night to get rid of all the rubbish and food on the floor the food available on the a la carte menu at the hotel was very limited
