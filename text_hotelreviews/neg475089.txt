it was my time in this hotel but unfortunatelly the staff do not know how to say thanks to the client who choose their hotel again in milano the choice of the hotel is huge i booked the room with king size bed when i made check in and entered in the room i found out bad suprises first of all instead of king size bed it was queen size french bed which is much less in size queen size bed usually counts as a single bed as the result my husband and i did not sleep well all the night because we were disturbing each other everytime we were moving by the standards of this hotel chain the second towel is situated in the wardrobe and it was not in the bathroom there was only shampoo and other things for person thanks to the staff at the reception and facchino i received everything after call another suprise was waiting for me when i entered in the bathroom the bathroom was for the disable person when i tried to change the room the answer was we are sorry but we are fully booked i also work in the hotel and i know that the hotel can t give the guest a room of a lesser category in case of the overbooking it should be done the upgrade not low grade we paid enough for it or the hotel should contact the guest to explain the situation and to find a compromise so unfortunatelly it was our last visit in this hotel
