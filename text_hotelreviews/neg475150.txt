me and my friend each booked a room for his family i have infants and my friend has one infant and small kids when we arrived at the hotel we found out that both of us got exactly the same room which had queen size bed and a bed sofa he had to pay double my price only because they had put bed sheets on the bed sofa that was really unacceptable and we feel that we have been deceived
