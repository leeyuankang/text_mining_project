even when we set the do not disturb sign on the door and told the staff not to service the room they still came in twice that day the second time we were there taking a nap the wifi was terrible and i mean completely useless i just ended up using my mobile data connection for everything there were no power outlets near the bed maybe this is not important for everyone but i work with my phone and having it all the way across the room while in bed was annoying
