we ve booked rooms but for the second room we were able to check in only at pm and none of the stuff seemed too affected that we came from a night flight and that we especially requested early check in so we could get some sleep second day we leave the do not disturb sign on the doorknob but the housekeeping totally ignored it and came in they even went through my personal stuff which i find very disturbing i ve talked to the receptionist and he told me that was kind of my fault because you need to put the sign on the door and also tell them personally that you don t want your room cleaned what s the point of the sign then i didn t like at all the staff s attitude they seemed like they don t care about the guest s issues at all too bad because the place looks really nice
