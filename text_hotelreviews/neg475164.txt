i booked rooms for nights when i came to the hotel the manager told me that they had an electricity problem and asked us to the spend the first night in the other hotel to make it clear i wrote to the hotel beforehand that i will be arriving late and got the confirmation that they were waiting for us i had eldery mothers with me who were tired after the trip the most unpleasant moment was that the hotel obviously was overbooked and they lied to me about some electricity problems i didn t want to scandal and went to the other hotel but at the reception of the hotel where they put us i checked witht the reception lady and she said thet we were the only ones who were relocated for the night from acca palace if the hotel is star and wants to be a boutique one it is absolutely unacceptable to sell more rooms that are available plus my rooms were not just booked they were fully prepaid
