was overcharged by rude staff contacted hotel said cannot find reservation number and couldn t assist me contacted bookings and they ve contacted the hotel and returned my emails mentioning reason for overcharge was due to loss of key which was untrue the key has a damn weight on it and you have to return to reception every time you pop out bookings are being unreasonable and siding with the hotel even after i have submitted many forms of proof showing that i have being overcharged asked for a double room received to single beds with dirty duvet was shown i would get a view from balcony instead received a room on the second floor looking at a ghost town shower was overly disgusting avoid bookings staff are unhelpful and couldn t care less about the customers honestly use someone else as that exactly what i would be doing bookings can thank acca palace for loosing a very frequent booker
