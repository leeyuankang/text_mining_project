their service is pretty terrible we initially got a room where the air conditioning and some lights weren t working so we were moved to another room however we were later told that the following day we need to move again to another room because someone else had already booked this room i looked at different rooms and none of them were up to mark basic things like light and air conditioning not working and the manager basically said too bad you have to pick one we have nothing else i would understand if i was being unnecessarily fussy but i would expect working lights the rooms are already quite dark and basic air conditioning
