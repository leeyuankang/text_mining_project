cappucino for breakfast was the worst i have ever had in italy lost an expensive torch in the room too hotel management is insincere and callous accidentally double booked hotel room and requested for refund hotel gave alot of bull reasons and refused to refund us even though it was a genuine mistake originally mentioned that booking com doesn t allow them to refund pressed with facts from booking com changed their story to something else not a credible and honest hotel the star ratings is overrated the star ones we stayed in florence and rome were even better than this no complimentary drinking water and drinks in a room unacceptable for a star hotel location was near to nowhere other than a metro station biggest disappointment for hotel selection in italy stay at your own risk okie only if you don t need to interact with the staff majority of good reviews on this website belongs to travellers with minimum interaction with staff do not expect the staff to go the extra mile to understand your plight protect your belongings when leaving the room
