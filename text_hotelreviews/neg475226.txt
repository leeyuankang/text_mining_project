hotel not fully enclosed when you step outside your room or front desk area you are outside it is covered but you are subject to the outside temperature the rooms more than make up for that the rooms are very nice no reflection on hotel fly into main airport not linate take metro rail to hotel i flew into linate there is no metro rail there got ripped off by cab for euros price to hotel costs euros to get from hotel back to airport milan metro rail is excellent and tourist friendly rail would have cost me less than euros round trip will fly into main airport next time
