heating is managed centrally by the hotel you can t adjust it yourself in the room at least it was not working in the room we stayed so when you are returning back to the hotel in the evening room feels like sauna we had to open all windows to cool it a bit down otherwise it would not be possible to sleep however when we called the reception hotel staff decreased a bit the temperature specifically for the night so we could get proper sleep
