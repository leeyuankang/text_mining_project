this is pretty much a place where you would bring a lady of the night the fact that the first guest i saw walking in here was such a lady was just a hilarious coincidence the room was clean but looked a bit beaten up serious cosmetic damages stained shower curtain lamps used bathrobe in the closet cracked walls door just added to the ambiance thankfully i had no neighbors actively using the squeaky bed
