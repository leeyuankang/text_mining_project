the hotel is in major need of renovation the place is very old the room and bathroom were not clean at all the bed mattress was not comfortable but i had arrived in the morning and was too tired at night to care i was glad i was only there for one night the reason i stayed at that hotel was because it was next to my friend s flat which is where i spent the remainder of my stay in london
