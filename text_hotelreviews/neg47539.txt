the room was hot because of the sun they could have closed the curtains or turned on the air conditioning it smelled of cigarettes and the carpet was filthy we asked for another room and they proposed a room at the back with a small double bed instead of the twin room we had booked so we refused the lever of the bath and shower mixer was missing so we had to pull on the bolt in the common sitting room the upholstery of the sofas was torn and worn out the carpet was being held together with tape this is not a star hotel booking com has mislead us seriously
