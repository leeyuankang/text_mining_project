on our second night the laundry carts were moved out to the street this was from about until it was extremely loud as we were directly on top i went to the reception at and said i need a different room the friendly receptionist apologized and gave us a better quieter room the breakfast is good but the breakfast room without windows is very draughty airconditioning and a bit small otherwise maybe a bit too expensive for the quality provided
