we were stuck in the elevator around for more than one hour almost minutes because of an electricity problem in the hotel after a short storm plus the alarm in the elevator was not working security issue and the staff did not know for a while that we were stuck until we called them good we had a phone signal although they had seen us take the lift we called who said that electricity was cut for a little while and came back but apparently not to the hotel and then after we went out of the elevator there was no electricity in all the hotel for at least hours that night and above all that bad experience the hotel charged the night no apologies at all for anything and the staff was rude and inefficient in managing the situation unfriendly team would not stay again
