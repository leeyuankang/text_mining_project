our trip did not start well with three moves of room as a smell of raw sewarage was evident in rooms spoke to the manager who told me its a known problem just be aware breakfast is only just adequate reasonable selection but not really star rooms quite old and beds sagging asked for walk in shower but only over bath available which was quite difficult to use
