would not recommend this hotel to anyone looking to have a relaxing stay in london rude staff that will open your room s door without notice or apology the rooms are not well maintained our room had a horrible rancid smell with that issue the hotel moved us to three different rooms which were smaller than the one we booked and paid for very disappointing
