we were a little disappointed with the hotel pool we weren t expecting something recreational but the pool itself and the area were a bit small and the pool itself was quite cold we were hoping for something a little more spa sauna like it is definitely not an area meant for kids but i suppose the shallow depth would be good for younger children
