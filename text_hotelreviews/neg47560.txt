i always worry when i don t book directly with the hotel and this was one of those times for the price paid the decor was terrible the room had a carpet you did not want to even think about removing your shoes to walk on the shower did not work you either had boiling hot water or freezing cold i was not impressed when i was moved to another room i pulled back the bed cover and the quilt had a huge stain on it nope not doing that one again please just because i am a single traveller does not mean i will put up with sub standard hotel rooms i think it s just plain rude
