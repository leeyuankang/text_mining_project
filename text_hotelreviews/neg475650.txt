if i thought i was going to a three star hotel i probably would have rated it higher no gym proper restaurant or bar the internet is terrible unless you want to pay more not a tactic i would expect from a four star hotel if you are a person that likes a hot breakfast you will be very disappointed scrambled eggs that look like a child made them terrible bacon with mini hotdog sausages also a poor choice of cereal basically my main gripe is they are mascarading as a four star hotel while offering the service and facilities of a good budget hotel
