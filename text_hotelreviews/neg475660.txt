if i went to milan again i would consider a different hotel next time it was quite far from the city and the canals area minute walk for the cost of the hotel i would have expected it to be closer tot he city the entry of the building was lovely quite well looked after but the hotel room itself looked old and very much like a university dorm it was very small and cramped the bathroom was the same old and small the air conditioning in the room was quite noisy compared to other hotels i stayed in the staff ordered organised a taxi for us when we left to go to the airport hotel staff told us it was a flat rate of euros but when we got to the airport the driver demanded we pay euros this was realty disappointing and frustrating
