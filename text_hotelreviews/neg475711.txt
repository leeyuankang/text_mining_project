the hotel is far too expensive for the services they offered there was no help with heavy luggage the room was fitted with one large bed and a sofa bed whilst i had booked a triple room room decoration looked spartan for a star hotel situated by a main road noise traffic is perceptible day and night nothing to see outside the hotel as the neighborhood is popular so you have to keep the windows shaded the closest metro station is at minutes walking distance parking lot offers small parking places so you cannot open doors decently if two cars are parked adjacently staff seemed more embarrassed when seeing us than welcoming breakfast was poor fresh juice would be most welcomed
