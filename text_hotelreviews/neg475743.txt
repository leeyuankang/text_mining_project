we were first given a room on first floor facing the street due to poor phonic isolation and dense traffic was difficult to get decent sleep the following day we were provided with a quite room at the back but when we went back from dinner we were shocked by the awful sewer smell coming from the shower too tired to change room outcome an outrageously expensive place considering poor standing if rooms when we signaled this to the lobby attendant upon checkout no reaction mere indifference
