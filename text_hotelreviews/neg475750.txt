the deposit of euros in order to receive the room safe box key i was really surprised with this in this type of hotel it is the first time i gave a deposit to use a safe box and the worst is that while paying the hotel bill before leaving for the airport i forgot to return the key and get my euros back i phoned from the prat airport as soon as i realized i had the key but in spite i offer to send the key express mail from london and get back my money they said that they were sorry i wander how many people staying at the exe hotel forget about returning the safe box key i think it is a must for the people at the reception to remind the clients about returning the key another issue is the importance of having bottles of water available at no charge
