we arrived from morocco where we stayed in a star and were treated like royalty we arrived at this hotel hardly greeted not even a smile and the female manager there was just as rude i told the staff how my luggage had been lost they didn t even offer any help didn t mention is there anything we can do there is a supermarket next door if you need toiletries nothing we were then welcomed by our minuscule room where the bed was ridiculously springy old and uncomfortable only to find nothing resembled the photos i complained and they said they had nothing available until tomorrow the next morning i was greeted by a lovely gentleman who apologised for everything changed our room and went above and beyond for us he even phoned he airline multiple times to track my suitcase what was interesting is the rude staff we had initially continued to be rude besides this lovely gentleman and one other lady our stay would have been completely ruined and it was our honeymoon the hotel is extremely overpriced and is definitely not a star if you are lucky enough to get the only two nice staff when you arrive you will enjoy your stay otherwise good luck i don t know how these people have jobs when we were leaving i said goodbye to one of the girls and she literally mummbled something back that sounded like a groan we will definitely be returning to this amazing city just not that hotel i was reluctant to write a bad review given the man went above and beyond to fix the damage those girls caused however when they continued to be rude i thought i would hate for someone to experience what we did with them
