this hotel is rated at star it deserves only at star it s an old building with old design and old furniture even an old safe which requires for a key deposit no fridge and no coffee maker only staff working at front desk no restaurant poor breakfast menu which costs extra we booked this hotel because we trust the rating on booking com the rating is flawed and the rate is a rip off i will report to appropriate travelling agency about this flawed rating which lures unsuspecting travellers to this facility we come expecting a star hotel and left totally disappointed
