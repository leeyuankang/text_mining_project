the taxi that they ordered for me when i left to catch the aero bus tried to bully me into him taking me to the airport and the fare increased by euro more than the same journey two days before and when i questioned this he informed me it was because i wasn t spanish and he refused to give me my luggage unless i paid him what he wanted very poor service
