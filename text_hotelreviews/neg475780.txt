very noisy not the hotel s fault though as inconsiderate guests i could cope with the busy road as knew about that when booked damaged bathroom sink cracked shower leaked and obvious water damage to door requested a double room but single beds pushed together and very hard bedside lights could not be turned off individually you turn one off they both went off not the best when one wants to sleep and the other person wants to read also there were reading lights attached to lamps but again don t work individually or even independently of the lamp turn the lamp off and the reading light went off
