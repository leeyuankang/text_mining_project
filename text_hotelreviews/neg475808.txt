i use a power wheelchair and therefore looked for an accessible room suitable for for my needs i corresponded in email to make sure the room is suitable and asked whether it s big enough for getting around with a wheelchair they assured me that the accessible room is one of the largest in the hotel and the customers who has previously occupied it never told them that it was uncomfortable for a wheelchair well guess what when we got there at midnight we discovered there are steps at the entrance with some small platform to bring up the wheelchair the platform was too small and i nearly fell off it the chair was heavy so the platform banged on every step on the way up the room it self was dull crowded and tiny not at all suitable for a wheelchair user there was no way for me to get into the bed in a comfortable manner my care giver had to pull and me from the feet in order to transfer me from and into my chair the bathroom was tiny as well and i could hardly manage in and out with the shower chair i asked the receptionist whether the hotel was really stars because i couldn t see anything there that s worth more than in the morning after a sleepless night and a dull breakfast i complained to the manager and told him there was no way i could sleep there one more night he was decent enough to call other hotels around though if he were more decent he wouldn t have charged me at all for the first night and not declare he had accessible facilities in first place it was total misleading that ruined my first night and day in the city after several hours luckily he found another hotel right up the street with full accessibility wonderful service and it came out euros less for the remaining time good riddance
