rooms are outdated beds not comfortable you can feel the springs we needed to change rooms due to water from the shower flooding all over the bathroom floor this wasn t possible on the first day when we discovered the issue unless we were willing to take a smaller room without a refund on the second day of our four day stay they forgot to save us a room again so we needed to wait until the day to switch rooms they did offer to refund one night of my stay but i feel that half of our stay was more hectic than necessary due to this issue worst yet is that the room we changed from was rented out again the same day and i highly doubt they had the opportunity to resolve the issue manager angela was one of the only employees who seemed to know how to properly treat a customer
