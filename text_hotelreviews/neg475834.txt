this hotel is very basic no restaurant no bar no tea or coffee facilities in the room the rooms are very small with no decorations or artwork a tiny bottle of water from the mini bar was the worst part was the breakfast instant eggs and cheap pastries and deli meat if you consider yourself a healthy eater or even have anything of a distinguishing pallete you should plan on eating breakfast out
