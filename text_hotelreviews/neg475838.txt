we were given room the bathroom facilities are terribly outdated and are a safety issue the bed has a headstand on one side only the air conditioning does not work and fails to cool the room next day we were placed in again with no air conditioning whatsoever very poor outdated facilities hotel would not recommend this place to anyone visiting from u s staff is not well trained to handle guests courteously
