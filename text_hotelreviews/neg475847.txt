the staff paid no attention to my request for a quiet room first giving me a room facing the avenue on the floor after saying that they were completely booked we were finally able to change our room to the floor after threatening to try to make a booking using our mobile phone the room had no air conditioning and was so hot that we were forced to open the window for air making it noisy inside the rooms are not decorated at all not even with a picture on the wall upon departure they said that calling a taxi was best but after minutes waiting and seeing several available taxis pass in front of the hotel we opted to hail a taxi which took no more than seconds i would not recommend this hotel at all
