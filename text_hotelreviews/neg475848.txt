sleep quality is terrible due to noise this place is fine if you are young and roughing it out but not a place for adults the first night friday was a noisy disaster there was a bunch of young lads on our floor who kept making a ruckus i made a complaint at pm when i had enough i did not pay a price of euro per night to endure this hotel staff are nice but they really need to enforce noise rules better the doors are not noise proof and slam easily and loudly imagine the noise all night it got better the next two nights but still left a bad taste
