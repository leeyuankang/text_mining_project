the reception staff not professional and rude towards certain customers of ethnicity internet wifi not working when asked about it the reception staff answered it is the problem with technician which i dont understand however later i realised that they had this issue with internet since long as they mention it in the letter that they gave us contact for internet problem some contact number but as the wifi is included in the hotel facility it is the responsibility of the hotel the reception was childish to understand it
