entering the hotel you fell this intense incense smell the lift smells like toilet in the room you hear everything in the room next door the wifi is terrible even in the lobby the first day i was going to grab a coffee in the breakfast room and the cup was glued to the saucer the water from the shower had variations from freezing cold to burning hot without me touching the tap
