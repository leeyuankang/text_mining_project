it was noisy at night we had trouble sleeping also the bed was right beside a wall which for me was abit claustrophobic the biggest thing for me was that the reason i booked it was because it stated there was an airport shuttle bus however when i enquired about it i was informed there was no shuttle bus but that they could book a taxi for us we thought that was misleading
