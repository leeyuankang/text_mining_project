the hotel is in a great location and because of the location is good value however the hotel really needs renovation i was woken up at by water pouring through my ceiling from upstairs i was moved to a room where the heating didn t work and the taps on the bath didn t turn on i was given a discount because of this but this didn t particularly warm me up some of the staff are friendly but i found that most lacked the basic manners and courtesy required in the hospitality industry plus the relentless banging on doors in the morning even with a do not disturb sign hanging to clean the room and provide maintenance did not result in a restful lie in
