the internet connection was poor the reading light did not work and could not be fixed until after my check out when i arrived over an hour later than the check in time my room was not ready the key cards systematically demagnetize and no i did not put them near my phone or anything like that the room cleaning shift was too late in the afternoon so that i had my room not cleaned for half of the day as i travelled for work and had to stay at the hotel working for hours all this was very annoying
