the interior was a bit shabby and the lighting in the room was way too low perhaps to hide the shabby bits the toilet handle went right round although it did work and the toilet roll holder was not fixed to the wall properly and moved one of the bed side lights was broken and didn t work there was a large patch in the corner of the ceiling which was a different colour to the rest of the ceiling the doors to the rooms from the corridor were scuffed and scratched apart from the lighting all superficial things that could be fixed quite easily
