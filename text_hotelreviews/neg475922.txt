initially we were not given the bed style we requested and we were told there was nothing else available once i called for the manager it suddenly came available there is not air conditioning in this hotel it either runs on fan or hot and the fan was noisy and had no stong flow of air the afternoon sun faces this room and it was so hot and uncomfortable the manger provide us with a standing fan but this still did not push much wind around the bathroom was covered in mould and the room had the tile grout falling out all over the place the main mirror was also dirty
