the hotel was not clean at all the rooms were dirty and there was nothing common to the photos we saw into booking the room was very cold air condition was not working they had an extra electric radiator to use in case of cold which is unacceptable for a hotel and no one informed us about it wifi was very poor even near to the reception rooms were not equipped as they should bathrobes slippers etc the staff was not polite definitely not value for money
