so many kids there which surprised me for the style of hotel it is very luxurious and classy and ruined by many kids charging around and bombing in the pool nothing worst then relaxing and sunbathing to be getting wet every time a kid dives into the pool i ve got no problem with kids just felt like either the staff or there parents should have more control over them
