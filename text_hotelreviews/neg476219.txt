the only thing we really didn t like was that one day staff was smoking in the rooftop pantry kitchen and that a chef was seen picking sliced fruit from containers and putting it in his mouth with his bare hands and licking fingers despite the fact that the roof wasn t open to just everyone from the street it did get a bit crowded up there and we feel personnel should help a bit more to keep people from hogging the beds and the sofa s with towels while not actually using them for sometimes an hour or longer on end we had to wait and couldn t sit to eat and drink while others had left their towels to reserve a space i guess the waiters were just too nice to remove them
