the only thing that constantly was nagging us was the actions of the staff during breakfast they missed the order quite often i e bringing black tea or even coffee instead of ordered green bringing hard boiled instead of soft boiled eggs bringing two eggs on several occasions even though we explicitly ordered one etc not a big deal especially that otherwise the selection of food was excellent
