pool was packed so packed that there were no seats anywhere asked how it was so packed and they indicated non hotel guests were using the pool we tried different times to use it with the same results no seats so we left we waited for a while just standing to get a drink with no luck staff there was swamped we did get to use it the last day and it was wonderful the views drinks and food disappointed though that we got ready to swim and relax multiple times and had to come back to the rooms immediately
