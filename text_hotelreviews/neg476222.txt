breakfast was not up to five star hotel standard very unhappy about the sky bar the day we arrived went for pre dinner drinks unable to get a seat as other guests were using all the main bar seating area for sunbathing went back later for night cap the bar haven t been tidied up with rubbish and towels lying all over the place the young bar staff appear to have no control on stopping guests hogging bar seating area for hours on end other thing that really annoyed me was the euro charge to use the steam room and sauna for minutes
