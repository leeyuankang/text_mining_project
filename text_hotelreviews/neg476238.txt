when we arrived at the hotel the receptionist was a bit too friendly and asked my boyfriend to carry the bags in the room by himself which is very bad we are a young couple however we re used to attend hotels and this never happened anywhere else before i think this should not happen as it s a minimum service to carry the luggage and show us the room when we arrived in the room we where suprised because there was a wall right in front of our window with a man smoking his cigarette and looking at us no intimicy of course we asked to change the room immediatly and we were offered another room which was fine according to me the staff should anticipate more the client s needs especially if you pretend to be a hotel in addition the rooms are not isolated which means that you litterally hear the other clients flushing the toilet
