the breakfast unfortunately the breakfast was a little weak in selection it would benefit greatly by having a cooked selection on offer regarding how you want your eggs etc also in a hotel such as this i would have expected fresh salmon to be on the buffet and or more local produce such as found in the market at los rambolas
