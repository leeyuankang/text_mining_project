room was a bit smaller than i had expected and there was only one window so it could be a bit dingey even in the day the bathroom was not fully seperated and you could see the toilet from the bed even when the door was shut which was strange although our room was non smoking there was a strong smoke smell occasionally i think coming through ventilation when we went there was works going on throughout the hotel and the skybar was closed which was disapointing
