very ugly building from the probably the ugliest in the whole area i am pretty sure that many parts of the building haven t been renovated since the hotel needs massive modernisation refurbishing the floor restaurant was so sad i left it immediately beautiful views at least it took literally minutes for the water to get warm in the shower what a waste of water resources taking a quick shower is not possible at this hotel where does the hot water come from the middle of the earth even then the temperature was not constant i was given a first room with very poor wifi reception i got moved to a second room which was next door to a lift shaft and it was pretty noisy london is expensive for hotels but honestly who gives stars to hotels in uk stars for this place cmon
