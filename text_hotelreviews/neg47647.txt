i was staying in the langham london on the opposite side of the street for nights on business i decided to move hotels for night due to cost but did not expect such a drop in standards given the location of the hotel the general condition of the hotel was very tired and worn the staff were at best ok but certainly not well trained given that they are in a service industry
