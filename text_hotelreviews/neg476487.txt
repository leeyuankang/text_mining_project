i booked a doublet room as a single and got a single room i complained and they say we can not do anything we are full after long arguments they accepted at least to lower the price a little bit a very unfriendly way of treating the guests also i booked the hotel because of the gym big mistake it was so small and only had weights to kilos overall i was so disappointed with my visit to the hotel i will never go back and will not recommend anyone to stay there
