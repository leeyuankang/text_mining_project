misleading star rating this was a star hotel at the very best city taxes were a hidden charge that had to be paid which we were not made aware of before booking the staff were very impersonal and upon arrival they did not tell us about any of the facilities or lack of such as breakfast times and price etc there was building work on going when we arrived the decor was dated tired and shabby however this is possibly being restored breakfast was expensive for what it was and not replenished throughout the service the gym was about by so hot it was more of a sauna and had very limited equipment we stayed in a double room overlooking the main street which was very noisy with external doors not locking the room was very hot but the air conditioning was switched off due to the season and when i asked what could be done about this we were told to open the patio doors of which we were unable to do due to the noise the bathroom tiles were broken and my partner was greeted by a cockroach one morning every morning you were awoken to the sounds of the cleaning staff banging and talking on their radios despite the rooms being advertised as sound proof all in all i would recommend looking somewhere else and read the reviews of hotels rather than take the star rating on face value
