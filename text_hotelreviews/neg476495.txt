the early check in was in another room then we booked it was very small and didn t have a propper window the bed was very small for two persons and it was very claustrofobic without daylight the next day we moved to the room we orignally booked where there were issues with the bathroom it smelled like a public toilet we told the staff in the morning the guy promised to check it out but no one checked and it was even worse when we returned at the bed wasn t even made after we told them again they weren t very helpfull to check the phone didn t work and we had to go down times before they send someone there were people working at reception but i didn t feel like they really wanted to help in the end they asked us to move rooms again and they gave us another room with a very small window it was the only option they had for a hotel you would expect better service or maybe some apologies for the inconvenience no compensation offered for moving twice in days i wouldn t stay here again
