worst experience ever i asked in advance for a nice room with a window to the street because the trip was a present i did also received a confirmation from the hotel on the same day of my arrival the moment i arrived they gave us the worst room small dark and smelly with a window inside a building with no sunlight in the minibar the water was already open and used by others i asked to change the room because they did send me a confirmation the sir on the reception wasn t very nice at the end we could move the next day but the surprise was already ruined for a star hotel i did expected more the lobby was nice and clean but the rooms not the next day we move that room was much better but also here some water in the minibar already open and half drunk from other people i have no idea but it was disgusting i travel a lot to barcelona but for sure i will not go again in this hotel
