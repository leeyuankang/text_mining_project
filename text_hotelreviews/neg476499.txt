i booked nights at this hotel in a double twin room which stated had a full bathroom suite with a bath when we arrived we got given a room with a full disabled bathroom with no bath when i requested to be moved it was impossible until the next day as the hotel was full this was very inconvenient as we had just got off a long flight and needed a hot bath to relax in this ruined our night and plans we moved the next day to a double twin room which was also inconvenient we came for a relaxing holiday i wouldn t say this hotel was worthy of stars there were no tea or coffee facilities the bathroom was very dated also also on one of our days there our room never got cleaned and nothing got mentioned we had to ask for clean towels the staff was not very helpful or welcoming and when we had problems we got made to feel like a huge inconvenience i would say this hotel is worthy of maybe stars maximum after my experience here
