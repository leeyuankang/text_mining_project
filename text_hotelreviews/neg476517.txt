this hotel is everywhere dirty lifts hallways bathroom everything in the lift there was a sign hanging that they might not have water for the day because of work when i complained to the receptionist she said that it is not her problem and that she hears this every day they also gave us a connected room although we were just the of us and we could hear everything from the other guests next door except the location this hotel is not recommendable
