the wireless in the room worked only intermittently they should not claim that they p provide wireless in the rooms the person at the reception basically admitted that their wireless often does now work with tablets but you cannot find this info on the web once i had problem with wifi i would change the hotel but they made me pay at the beginning of the stay still it was not too bad for a two night stay for a longer stay it would be unsuitable without a proper internet
