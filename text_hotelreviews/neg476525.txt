beds are horrendous rooms are worn out and smelly rooms look out on another building and there is no day light entering the room lighting in the room is absolutely non sufficient toiletries in bathrooms are more than basic we could hear every word from the room next to us housekeeper came into our room early morning to take a door tag despite our clear yelling not to enter as we were in bed she absolutely ignorred us and pretended like there s nobody there to take the door tag there is no value for money here
