first of all being an avid traveller and having stayed in many hotels over the years i can definitely say that this is not a star hotel should be i called the hotel before booking and i asked i will only book if early checkin around was available the answer was yes and i booked accordingly i arrived at the property about quarter to only to be told only one smoking room is available as in take it or wait until they should have stated this on the phone i was given no other choice and had to take the smoking room i must say i found this attitude disturbing at the start of my stay when i went to the room it wasn t only the horrible smell of heavy smoking the room smelt like it hadn t been aired in a looooong time i had to open the windows and air it myself it was also dirty there were hairs and dust on the floor as well as stains as if someone walked around with their boots on the wet floor the windows faced atrium walls only a couple of meters away so clostrophobic sound insulation was also not good at all not cheap at all too after paying night not even breakfast included one expects higher standards i think they got a bit comfortable cos it s at an okay location i think they think people will keep coming no matter what i wouldn t be so sure with their current standards poor
