rooms where clean but tiles where cracked and dangerous and some of the fixtures and fittings were falling apart otherwise good size room that was clean did see a smaller double room that looked tiny so i would ask for larger room if i had got that as look claustrophobic but that s my preference we had a street view we come from a city so the noise didn t tend to bother us but if your from a quiet surrounding ask for a non street view otherwise the noise may keep you up the city doesn t sleep
