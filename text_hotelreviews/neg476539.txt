we had to wait over an hour after the usual check in time there was no iron available or ironing room so instead you have to pay for an ironing service our room was okay better than what we expected after reading some terrible reviews they are basic and fairly clean but not spotless like you would hope slept on top of the covers as they were so thin and very close to the mattress which didn t look clean enough
