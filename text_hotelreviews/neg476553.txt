the room has no window to the outside meaning i had no fresh air or any idea how is the weather outside it will be fair if the hotel categorize this type of room in separate category some hotels do i d rather stay in a two star hotel with window than feeling trapped in a room like this in a four star hotel the room is not worth this price
