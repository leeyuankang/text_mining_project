we ve found a cockrouch in a toilette and there was no view from a room the windows was covered with some foil which was not showing the awful view outside by awful i mean the wall from the next building and some pipes generally toilette was not clean the bath had some dark spots on a silicon i think this was some fungal or something which obviously could be cleaned with any chlorine detergent and the cockrouch was the worst finally we did get other room but still it was a shock that it happened in a hotel which seems to worry about quality the rooms on a lower level are generally not worth any money toilette could be cleaner in general
