our hotel had zero air con which was a feature which was included and in degree heat of august this was terrible and on talking to staff at reception they were not able to provide a fan as it was august they offered free breakfast but as we were departing early the following day this wasn t a solution we could have taken advantage of the room was extremely basic with no ironing facilities or kettle room had refrigerator which wasn t working and tiles in bathroom were cracked and not the cleanest bathtub and sinks had awfully suspicious black hairs room was over all tired and needing a good revamp i would only recommend this hotel to budget conscious travels and not for a romantic city break i came on my birthday for nights with my best mate for a crazy weekend and we most certainly had this taking my partner here for a romantic weekend i wouldn t have even unpacked my bags it s as basic and you could imagine
