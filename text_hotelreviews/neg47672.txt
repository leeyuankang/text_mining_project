hotel was very shabby in both decor and furniture our room was a deluxe double really settee especially in our room extremely worn bath was discoloured in places the hotel needs a complete refurb worn carpets with strips of duct tape and scuffed furniture in lounge we are used to hotels and did not consider this was of that standard we had a sense of a tired and neglected business with staff doing their best
