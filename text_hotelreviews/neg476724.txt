probably gave us the worst room in the house which was facing the street not sure if it was because we were only staying for one night loud traffic could be heard from the room which resulted in general annoyance and a lack of sleep room also didn t have great hallway sound proofing and given this is near the gym facilities you can hear people talking and walking in and out room layout also wasn t great the shower is a glass box facing the bed while this might seem perfect from a voyeur perspective this isn t practical if one person is trying to sleep and the other has lights on in the bathroom not sure if all the rooms are like this highly suggest if you get room to change very impersonal staff compared to other hotels we stayed at on our trip we stayed at many ranging from boutique to star
