the service wasn t the best the whole experience felt very impersonal we stayed for a week and even by the end felt like we were faceless in a crowd we had various mix ups initially given the wrong room failed wake up call wrong drink orders etc also wasn t a fan of the bathroom layout which doesn t allow for any privacy particularly difficult if you are traveling with a friend rather than partner
