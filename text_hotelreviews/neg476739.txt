the roof top and pool pictures were so misrepresenting the real and actual view the pool was so so so small and since it s in the gothic area it was quite noisy at night some young people were drinking on the street almost every night and making quite a lot of noise the window was not double glassed therefore we were being woken up a few times at night the breakfast was not worth the money poor quality food and not many choices only staff working in the morning and have affected the service quality also don t blame them as they have good attitude but just too much work and not enough staff
