i thought it was a tad overpriced for what we paid and there were a few housekeeping issues stains on our suite sofa shower hose attachment falling off the wall and shower nozzle on bath was broken but these were small things that didn t dampen the experience some blankets on the roof terrace or fixed heaters might have been nice when it was cold as it was still nice to sit up there but way too cold in the evening take a warm wrap for cooler months
