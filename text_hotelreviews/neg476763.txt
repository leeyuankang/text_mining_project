although booked six months in advance they gave a first floor room with street and metro noise strangely enough everytime the metro passes the room was rambling it was supposed to be a five star hotel but there is no reception or lobby area that was very dissapointing the hotel management gives priority to outside customers for restaurants they do not make you feel special stairs are too dimly lit hard to see your steps breakfast area is too little and food is very poor for a five star hotel nice terrace but no service
