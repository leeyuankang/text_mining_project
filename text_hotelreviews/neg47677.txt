the hotel is tired unloved and shabby some staff are lovely but morale is clearly low they are working in an unloved shabby hotel and they know it i arrived in my room to find a bath full of disgusting shaving hairs the drains were not working or else it hadn t been properly cleaned a lovely night manager immediately moved me to another room great potential wonderful views again all creaking chipped and tired looking the following morning as i was checking out i asked whether my room rate included breakfast the receptionist acted as if i was just trying it on and replied oh go on then we ll give you your breakfast too even though we upgraded you last night i was so astonished i didn t know what to say not all guests are free loaders and a little customer service goes a long way this place needs a makeover and new management it is in a great location and could and should be so much better
