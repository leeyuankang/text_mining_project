the management and the design of the hotel let me start with the design you walk in like going into a cave it is just pitch black you cannot see the steps the ground floor is split in half and on the second floor you have a tiny reception the rooms you can like or not i do not like to stand in a shower in the middle of the room with sides glass ground floor has a concierge desk which is constantly occupied because they are all on there own knowledge is not good enough for a star hotel the staff in many occasions is helpless because they have no or the wrong instructions manager is never visible food they claim to be among the best in barcelona i would say that this is very very far fetched we had new years dinner for euro each the wine selection which went with the dinner was good the food was the worst new years dinner i had in the last years and every year i have one in a hotel breakfast buffet is borderline acceptable for a star hotel after midnight the service broke down to almost zero sorry hotel ohla but there is room for improvement and there is also white paint the key in my world of design is the following statement modern but cozy your hotel is ultra modern and ice cold never again sorry
