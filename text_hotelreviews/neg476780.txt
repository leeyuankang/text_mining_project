the room was very strange with theglass shower in the middle of the room with no privacy at all you have to close the curtains of the window when having a shower so the people in the uilding opposite can t see you unfortunately the electricity went off three times for about a minute once when i was in the shower and as the curtains were closed i was left in pitch darkness
