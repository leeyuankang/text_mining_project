based on the star rating i do not feel the staff on the main floor was up to scratch the service at breakfast was fair allowing plates to pile up on our table while they were busy polishing wine glasses the breakfast also lacked a bit of variation particularly in the warm offerings the concierge although friendly and helpful allowed my wife to carry her bags in and out of the hotel upon arrival and departure small things but details are inportant i expect at a star hotel that the staff is falling over themselves to serve you
