the gothic quarter is much better looking at street level than at roof level if it was not for the amazing building right in front of the pool you would think you were looking into a brazilian favela i got a good room with a view i thank the welcoming team for that if i had one of the back rooms i would have felt a bit underwhelmed i felt a little pressured to tip after some irrelevant room air conditioning and safe information that i did not want nor requested i hate when staff do that the entrance does not quite ring star quality and the check in area seems almost like a simple office the rooftop pool is considerably smaller that i expected from the pictures but still a very good experience after visiting the bangkok sivatel star hotel pool i find it difficult to rate the two even in the vicinity of each other
