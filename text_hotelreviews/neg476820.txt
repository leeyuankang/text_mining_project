bedroom was quite small and bad value at euro for nights ie euro per night excluding breakfast in my room the shower which had glass sides was between the bed and the door to the corridor see photos you can see the shower head this meant no privacy if someone opened the bedroom door from the corridor while one was in the shower while the room layout was different in other rooms i saw three they were all quite small i ve had larger bedrooms in three star hotels the photo of the pool on the roof was deceiving the pool was tiny with glass sides so that guests sitting at tables could observe you through the side as if you were a gold fish in a bowl the color scheme within the communal areas of the hotel corridors and stairs was to a large extent black black floors black stairs black walls and black ceilings with dim lighting an accident waiting to happen on the black marble stairs in my opinion lifts were a bit frustrating to use only one went the whole way up to the roof but when you called it the other shorter lift would keep arriving you had to send that one away in order to allow the correct lift to arrive
