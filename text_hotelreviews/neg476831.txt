the room faced the front of the hotel and was very noisy throughout the night if you are booking request a room facing the back of the hotel that is on floor or we ate in the hotel on our first evening and the food was excellent a very good selection of tapas and delicious desserts later in the week the menu had changed to a more limited choice cheaper alternative breakfast was good but there was no option to have eggs cooked or other items only scrambled or boiled eggs were available the pool and the bar area on the roof of the hotel were very cleverly photographed for the website both were very small and did not resemble the publicity shots
