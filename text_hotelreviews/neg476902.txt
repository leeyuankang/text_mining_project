we requested a room on an upper level as we had read that the lower level rooms suffered noise from the underground trains we had a room on the floor out of but you can still hear a gentle rumble of trains until the service stops around midnight although that didn t seem to stop us getting to sleep maybe because the bed was so comfortable and the cocktails so nice the wifi was not great which might have been an issue if i had been on a business trip but manageable for personal use
