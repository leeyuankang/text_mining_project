the hotel is really tatty and the corridors smelt of something unpleasant everything i saw looks like it needs total refurbishment my room had iron burn marks on the threadbare carpet and the carpet was frayed along the edges the windows rattled all night the bathroom walls were peeling falling off and room smelt of cigarettes i don t feel it was good value for money
