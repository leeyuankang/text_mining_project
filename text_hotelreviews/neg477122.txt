honestly not a star hotel im not even sure if its a star hotel the room you get is small they dont offer you anything complementary not even water or coffee or the safe they dont have room service i was surprised they had someone to clean the rooms if you are someone who likes to feel just a little bit pampered when traveling or like to feel youre staying at a nice hotel this isnt for you if you care more about location and need the hotel just for sleeping might work for you but you can still probably find a better hotel around the same area
