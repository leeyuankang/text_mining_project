i had to ask to change rooms on occasions due to construction and poor cleanliness of room one smelled of raw sewage and staff thought it was acceptable to spray items on the floor and leave me a spray to keep the smell low the construction work was horrendous and couldn t sleep in morning after long nights of business meetings rooms didn t look like web page and when asked staff if they had one like the web page they laughed in my face also tried to put an unexpected on my bill for something never used will not recommend until some sort of apology or rebate is discussed in person regards mr h goudie
