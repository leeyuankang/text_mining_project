the room was not comfortable for example only place for proper light was the reading light air conditioning was ok for heat but the room was so hot all time i had to open the window in the end to get some cool air in can t imagine how it is in the summer as even in the beginning of march the afternoon sun heated the room very much all front desk staff that i spoke to during the days stay were indifferent in their communication which was strange to me as it was a small hotel expected them to be more friendly and communicative breakfast option was really disappointing very expensive and not very appealing there are many options to eat in the area would prefer to eat in the hotel if the was a decent vfm breakfast
