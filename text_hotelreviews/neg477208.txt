i rebooked here specifically because i stayed in january and the wifi was reliable and didn t need constantly to log back in this time the hotel has added a premium wifi that you have to pay for and the regular wifi has funnily enough become a disaster it was extremely poor dropping frequently and too slow to work even at best not good
