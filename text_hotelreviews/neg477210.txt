check in took me almost minutes hotel did not accomodate our request of having connected rooms or adjacent ones although we made a request for that three weeks before arrival we had to wait for the staff to try to find rooms in the same floor finally they located two rooms located away from each other no in room kettle or coffee making facility toilet seat was outdated and stained reception staff need to be trained to deal better with tourist when taking room access cards to the reception to be reprogrammed in the very next day of arrival he insisted that we pay for the stay immediately and would not wait till the of the stay as other hotels usually do although we were staying nights and they already had our credit card information
