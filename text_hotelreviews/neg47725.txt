initially given a very tired room on the floor with peeling paper holes in the walls and unsightly cables trailing down the wall from the tv distinct lack of interest or understanding when i asked for a better room and told to meet someone on the floor this is all we can give you was the hardly apologetic offer apparently the hotel is having a complete refurb which should be noted when you book small bed in this room the lights tripped when plugging in a verified phone charger and had to wait for this to be fixed drilling and hammering from the following morning which is the refurb happening the heights bar known for its views was actually closed by on the night i stayed there so no chance of a night cap either after the theatre very surprising for a supposedly full hotel in central london
