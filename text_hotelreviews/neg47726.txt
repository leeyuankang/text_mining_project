the hotel is currently under construction early the next morning i was woken up by the sounds of drilling and knocking what i didn t like was that fact that the hotel staff did not mention anything regarding the noise due to the hotel renovation it would be helpful if they could have briefed us that the hotel is currently being renovated and construction work starts in the morning around that way we could better prepare ourselves i e getting ear plugs etc
