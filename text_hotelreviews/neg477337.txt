room was really small and kind of worn pictures at the site for booking and reality did not match much we were kind of disappointed and would have preferred some international hotel chain hotel instead and hotel was not that close to the central station as expected although we chose from the booking app by near the central station as we had to wake up at to catch the bus to the airport beside central station
