this hotel needs a huge overhaul the bedrooms were so dirty grubby and run down the walls and ceiling are covered in grubby stains and there are more stains on the ceiling from what looks to be a water leak the headboard was covered in stains the bathroom looked like it hadn t been cleaned in years dust on every surface carpets worn to a thread in places windows can t be opened and as the rooms are so small it was very stuffy never saw a staff member smile unfriendly location is excellent but nothing else going for this hotel
