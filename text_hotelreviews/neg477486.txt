no bottled water for our stay although its usually the case for hotels in europe no toothbrush and other amenities too i asked for a toothbrush from the housekeeper but she say it can only be provided if i speak to the reception she don t speak english well enough so we are not sure if it means you ll need to pay for it it will be nice if amenities be can provided in the booking
