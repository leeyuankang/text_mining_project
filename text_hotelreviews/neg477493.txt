we had urine left on our toilet the cleaner came to correct this but we were not apologised to no milk is supplied with tea and coffee making facilities we rang reception to be told we do not supply this but then mins later someone came up with a little jug twice when we rang reception we found staff very rude answering the phone the tv in the room had no english channels and no hotel staff wanted to help us breakfast is continental with bacon egg and hotdog sausage but there is no beans tomatoes mushrooms etc to complete a full english so don t expect this food is very nice though
