wifi speed could be improved hygene is comparable to other hotels in milano in this price range but could be improved some rooms don t have a person bed but bed only not a problem if you re travelling alone but don t expect a large roomy room with a king sixe bed if you make a single person reservation there is limited parking space for taxi s in front of hotel so sometimes a bit dangerous to get out of the taxi
