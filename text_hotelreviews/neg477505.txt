the room was not what we paid for judging by the images on the website while booking especially the bathroom which was horrible and of course they denied getting us another room the staff was not friendly at all for the exception of maybe one person from the bar and they did not even know english which was bothersome the worst part was that there was wifi technically but i could not connect to it from a higher floor at all so i had to sit at the reception to get some work done it was not a pleasant experience at all
