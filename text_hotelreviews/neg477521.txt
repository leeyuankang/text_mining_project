breakfast is very simple and the same everyday we stayed for a week so it was hard to enjoy breakfast after day and the biggest fault of the breakfast is they dont offer any veg no tomatoes or cucumber also one of the breakfast staff was very rude one day by coming up to me and embarrassing in front of the whole restourant telling me off for making a sandwich to go as apparently it s not allowed to take anything out of the restaurant but i had a very early trip so simply didn t have time to eat my breakfast at the hotel they either need to state it very clearly that these are the rules or need to be more descteeet if they want to make a comment to a customer also that same waighter was very loud when making up tables where as others were very careful not to desturb the customers
