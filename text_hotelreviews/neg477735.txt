the room was horrible the ceiling and the walls were full of damp the curtains were dirty and the floor even worse i could not sleep because i felt unsafe the door s additional locker inside was broken and i was on the ground floor the room was for disabled people and there was the noise of a sort of extractor which i did not know where it came from and i could not stop it the facilities in the room were really essential very poor and definitely under standard for a hotel breakfast was very poor dried croissants tasteless cappuccino from a machine and not hand made the location is really far from everywhere and it took me minutes and to get to linate the day after i would never go back again
