everything in the room ist old in consideration of the price this hotel posted was acceptable but the cleanliness was unacceptable i found a ball of hair on the floor in front of the mirror and the bath was absolute horror the white bath curtain is yellow and stinky shower head is full with dirt i was not sure after shower did i get more clean or dirty based on this shower i would never ever give stars to this hotel this is unacceptable in any hotel of any level it is so easy to change these two things i hope they can improve this
