the location is awful it s right where milan ends and surrounded by gas stations extremely hard to get there especially at night the building looks very nice on the outside but really old fashioned and outdated inside apart from the bed the room was quite dirty and there was a bugger on one of the towels when we got there the light had gone off and the reception was all dark the city tax is almost double what it really is elsewhere we changed hotels during that same stay and found out the receptionist gave us indications and they were all wrong led us to a hour roam around the city at trying to find our way back wouldn t recommend to ask her anything
