the worst hotel i have even been to in my entire life curtains at windows were grey instead of white the carpet was full of stains the restaurant personnel simoly uneducated and no manners i simply cannot give stars at this hotel and i hope that my review will belp the other people and avoid this hotel even the subway is cleaner than those hotel rooms previously i guess smoking was allowed in the hotel because now all the walls are grey and it smells inside like into a bar it smells like cigarettes and dust horrible place
