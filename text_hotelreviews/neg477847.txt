the cleaning lady entered in the room without knocking and directly in the bathroom where i was taking a shower she didn t even say sorry at the reception the manager tryed to explain me that i didn t heard the knocking my boyfriend was in the room too in the bed very close to the door and he didn t heard the knocking because there was no knocking the room can be opened with a card the cleaning lady didn t see the card on the door after she entered in the room she didn t heard the water from the bathroom she entered and saw me naked very unpleasant i can say i was soooo upset and angry about that i mean i pay days at a stars hotel and they come in the room whenever they want with no explanation and if i dare to ask why a was disturbed while i was taking a shower they say that i didn t heard the knocking and that the cleaning lady has no fault in this problem really they treat you like you are the cleaning lady not the client the conclusion the cleaning lady was right and i the client was not i don t recommend this hotel by the way the breakfast at this stars hotel is the same every day the same
