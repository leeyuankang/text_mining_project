unfortunately in of the room kettle did not work at all and sink did not work properly also was a bit disappointed that during check in reception operator asked me if i like to have a breakfast as it was not included in our room rate and i indicated that i need only for one day however at check out in automatically counted for two days so i had to prove that we did not have breakfast what is the point to ask if we like to have breakfast if it is counted anyway
