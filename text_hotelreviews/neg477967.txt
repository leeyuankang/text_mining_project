we had the same hotel last year unfortunately this year we didn t feel the same comfort as last year we expected to have the room very cleaned in a perfect condition since it s a four star hotel in the bathroom we found hair and the toiletries were for one person even if the room was double the hotel is not so cheep so i think it should be more careful to details
