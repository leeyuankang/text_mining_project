unfortunately the staff didn t seem happy on the day of our arrival waited to check in for a while as only one staff member out of three was handling the front desk over heard one say to another customer you ll just have to wait because i m not doing check ins in the evening asked a staff member what the name of their restaurant was called as there are multiple names of their website he told me he didn t know and that it s just a restaurant at hilton we were put off and decided to go around the block and found some lovely local restaurants
