hotel should invest into softclose doors the lack of soundproof and lack of softclose woke me up several times a night thinking that someone just entered my room the closing of other rooms doors were heard so well that is the main reason why i will not stay in this hotel again i d like to sleep in peace and feel secure while doing it also sercvice in reception could be improved if you want was the response when i asked whether i can settle the bill in the evening before leaving it was right decesion as when i left m next morning there wasn t anyone at the reception other quests waited to check out and i was already in a hurry the cleaning lady never refilled inroom coffee facility only tea was available after first day on third day i called reception to ask them to provide more coffee which they then did but it would have been nice to arrive from the tireing day in the city to my room and make coffee right away without extra effort
