a bit far from city center but i knew that restaurant claims they are not allowed to serve tap water i believe them but its a joke if the tap water is safe in the room to drink and brush one s teeth why does the restaurant refuse to give some water for customers at euros for a large bottle italians may be used to it but that is just sad really sad or when you offer a bottle of water inform the guest at the table the cost and just watch the reaction
