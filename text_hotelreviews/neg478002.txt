the cleaning in the bathroom there was dried on excrement on the toilet seat which thankfully i checked before my four year old sat on it a long hair inside the toilet the check in staff were very apologetic about it offered to send cleaning up but luckily i had a lot of disinfecting wipes to sort it out as my year old could not wait that was very disappointing in what was a lovely hotel
