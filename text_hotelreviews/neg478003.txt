suburb location is at least mediocre in my opinion and a bit remote from the center parking in underground parking costs day if you do not find a parking in the free zone space very probable although i was lucky city tax in milan is night per person this cost is not included in booking price it is however clearly stated in booking com terms that this tax is not included in final quote and i think it applies to all hotels in milan but pay attention when calculating the overall costs
