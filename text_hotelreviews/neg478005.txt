the staff was rude we paid for breakfast when we checked in and it did not register in the system so when we went for breakfast a very unhelpful lady at the entrance of the restaurant would not let us in nor fix the problem this happened the second morning again we had to go to the front desk and complain and since they couldn t fix the issue they charged us twice all this trouble for quite an average breakfast that did not even offer proper coffee the hotel is very clean but the towels have a strong sour quemical smell
