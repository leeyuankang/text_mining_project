service was way below my expectation i originally planned to stay there only a night then i changed my plan to stay in milan for nights that i made another reservation i clearly informed the clerk who checked me in that i made two separate reservations then she gave me the key which works only for a night next day i had troubles getting to my room without knowing this system i asked her how she didn t inform and that i was had trouble she just said that s how system goes and she just forgot to tell me same lady i asked for the direction to get in center of milan without any consideration for someone who isn t so familiar with the area she said just go out side and turn left asked her where i could park or if i am required to do anything to prove i m guest to park here she answered park anywhere not helpful at all or no intention to help the location was alright little distant from city center but if you are travling by car then i guess it s okay location overall it was just alright experience nothing too shame or nothing to stand out facility was up for star hotel but i would give start hotel for service mind
