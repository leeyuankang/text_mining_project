unfortunately i have very negative experiences from my stay at hilton garden inn north milan the first thing i faced was that although the policy of the hotel on it s booking page states that they won t charge any deposit the hotel will do a pre authorization as i asked this is their right to do by the law which would be fine if they would inform the customer in advance about it like all the other hotels did where i booked a room at booking com the pre authorization turned out to be the full price of our stay my card was not charged but the amount was blocked meaning that this amount was not available for me for the next weeks which i find unacceptable as when we checked out i had to pay the whole amount from my card basically for a month i payed the double price until the block was released the hotel employees are very nice but speak only a very little english at least those to whom we talked the air conditioning in the room was extremely loud it was impossible to sleep when it was turned on what made our nights very uncomfortable parking in front of the hotel is free but if you want to park there be prepared to never move once you manage to find a place as only a very limited amount of parking slots is available there i guess it s an italian thing but you only receive one huge blanket for the bed i asked for a second one but it wasn t covered in anything and had some stains on it
