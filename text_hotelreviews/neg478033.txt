the room had probably very thin walls so every time somebody was opening door of a room nearby it was so loud that we weren t sure whether we have an uninvited visitor or not it was very intimidating one night there also was a false alarm but we couldn t hear the instruction because they were played at the same time the alarm was ringing so we couldn t hear anything and we were pretty scared we learned it was false only after some people from our floor went to ask the receptionist downstairs
