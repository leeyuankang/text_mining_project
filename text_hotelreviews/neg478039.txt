there were some minor flaws and damaged areas in our room but that would have been no great deal if the employees whom i told this at the reception reacted in a professional manner they didn t notice and didn t want to hear anything about that no sorry sir only aha ok and the rest was silence that is highly unprofessional and i never would have expected to be treated like this in an international hotel i missed the service aproach of hilton group if people at the reception would have been more responsive to my complaints everything would be ok
