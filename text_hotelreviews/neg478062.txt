our stay was almost perfect however there is something that really bother us on the last day we gave our luggages to the receptionist because we wanted to go shopping as we wanted to pick up our lugagges there was a bellboy who was quite unpolite he didn t speak english at all and just italian and he said to the receptionist china other italian words then he pointed our lugagges and pointed us so that we picked up our lugagges by ourselves my mother gave him however he didn t even think to help us with the lugagges this is a stars hotel and usually the bellboy helps us even without tipps this bellboy just took our money and pointed us to carry them by ourselves and what did he mean with the word china even if we don t understand italian it is a word that shouldn t have come up in the conversation between him and the receptionist
