the location was a bit far out for the nightlife south of the city centre at navigli tho near san giovani metro it was a lot of stops from the good stuff and there was little of use nearby for tourists the hotel was nice enough and modern but the gym was ill equipped and there could have been a pool the cleaner came everyday but failed to ever replenish the tea coffee materials or the shower gel also there was no sink hand soap when we arrived there was only one small shower gel in the bathroom for two adults in a kingside room i also rang down to reception for an iron when we arrived as there was no trouser press or iron in the room i was told i must use the laundry room on the floor which meant when i needed to press clothes i had to go down floors in the lift with clothes also there were no general use stairs only lifts and fire stairwells
