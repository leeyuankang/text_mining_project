they did not clean our room while we were out in the morning we put do not disturb sign on the door however by the time we left the hotel before noon we removed it when we came back to the hotel we were surprised that the room was not clean we asked why to the front desk they answered if we put do not disturb sign even early morning the cleaning lady will not clean that is not right we were so disappointed also wifi is super slow you have to pay extra money to have high speed
