upon selecting the hotel i read the reviews on trip advisor the most common review about the front desk service was lackluster however because everything else was rated good i decided to give it a try well the reviews were dead on the front desk service was not bad it was just not memorable hilton is known for outstanding all around service and services it is part of their brand this property does not have spa facilities or workout facility
