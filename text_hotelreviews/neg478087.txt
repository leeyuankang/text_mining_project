bigger hotels tend to always exclude smth from the regular package you usually get from any other hotels even b bs and then ask for extra money this one did not have breakfast included which was not a problem but why would you not add it from the very beginning to make the price look less stupid moves for a great chain plus the breakfast for euros per person had little difference from smaller hotels finally what ruined it for me the hot water was barely warm cannot understand how thats possible in a hilton hotel was a disappointment for me this time sorry
