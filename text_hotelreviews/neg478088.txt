the hotel is in the very bad location rooms are very very small you can barely walk in the room the lifts are scary they seem like they r falling apart and the staff is very disapointing if you ask a question at the reception they will look you with the face really and ignore you and somehow make you feel very bad that you asked them in the first place just rude the parking outside is very confusing undergorund parking is only in use of the hotel the other is used by some companies of the time is unusable i dont recommend this hotel
