located rather far from the center the easiest way to reach it is by train from milano certosa poor wifi it took me a very long time to connect on the first day and for the second day they actually changed the password unfortunately without any notice messed up my bill at checkout first charged too much then returned too little after i contacted booking com with request to fix it and returned the rest only after my second e mail
