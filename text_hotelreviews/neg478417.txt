overall the hotel seems dated and lacks any charm whatsoever be careful of the steps in the front they are all painted grey and drop suddenly with no warning signs i fell twice there is no bellboy present to help with luggage there is nothing around the hotel in terms of restaurants i found and things to watch lots of graffiti though and deserted streets very far from city center i ended up taking the metro tram into the city center which was much cheaper
