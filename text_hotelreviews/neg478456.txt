the staff at check in in my personal opinion was rude did not show any interest to even say good evening or welcome here etc was rather just looking down at the computer all the time and while looking down just said i need your passport and then just gave me the keys overall it dint feel like i was entering a premium hotel hilton group is a such a big group of hotels and certain courtesy is expected of the staff there may be it wasn t intentional and could just be a one off event but still it was quite a strange experience
