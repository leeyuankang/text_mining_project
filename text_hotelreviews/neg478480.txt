internet connection is of a world country standard i had to get up from my bed and move around the room until my iphone catches the wifi signal any hotel that tries to charge day for internet belongs to the century i had requested smoking room in my booking com reservation not noticing the tiny notes that this was a non smoking hotel upon arrival in milan the receptionist informed me that she read my special request for a smoking room but smoking is not allowed in the hotel i asked her why nobody informed me about this before by email she smiled and said that i should have read those tiny notes more carefully how sweet messrs hilton apparently believe that the hilton name and a clean bed should be enough to satisfy any foreign visitor well i certainly expect more for day
