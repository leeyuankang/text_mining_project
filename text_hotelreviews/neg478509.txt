when i checked in they asked for my credit even though i prepaid for the room and they already had my card details they said it was for just the city tax and as a safety measure if there is an accident next morning they blocked euros from my card without any warning it turned out that that euros charge was just a mistake and the other euro was a sort of safety deposit that they didn t tell me about i needed to make several complains to have the euros unblocked i don t like that fact they essentially they abused my credit card and acted like i was a nuisance when i complained i checked out on monday morning and they still haven t given me money back
