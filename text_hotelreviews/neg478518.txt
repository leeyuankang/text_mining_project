i am a hilton honors member and i was extremely surprised when i was advised upon check in that breakfast was not included but could be for per day really i have stayed at over different hotels in the past years throughout italy sometimes star star and on a couple of occasions even a star always without any exception breakfast was always included except for this time at the hilton i felt like i was class guest in a class hotel each morning as i walked past the breakfast area not an good experience with this one exception i enjoyed my stay very much
