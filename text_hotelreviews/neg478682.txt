the hotel is absolutely not at the standards of a the receptionnist was not competent even if he was trying to help we had booked a family room and they gave us double rooms he said they did not have any but actually it appears they were not usable we tried to change for a triple which would have allowed us to stay together but they gave a room that was already occupied imagine the face of the woman when we entered her room in each room there is a fridge for champagne just next to the bed which is terribly noisy and honestly quite useless i would not recommend this hotel
