in my arrival there was a very rude receptionist so my first impression about this hotel was extremely bad that bad that i was thinking to lose my money i had already paid for my stay and search for another hotel i always travel with my cat only to hotels that pets are allowed i also inform the hotels at the time of booking that i will have a pet with me just i case there is a problem or extra charge i made a special request in booking com for an earlier check in the check in is at because of my cat this receptionist had a really rude tone speaking to me loudly that this is a hotel for human not animals that i had the leave the hotel coming back at and at this time he would call his boss to see if i can have my cat he also mentioned that durian my days stay the cat should only stay inside that transport carriage when i arrived back at he didn t say anything about the cat i politely asked him that the cleaning personnel do not enter my room on the next day so that the cat is safe then he gave me the key of the room surprise the room has a problem and the door never locks later on i was informed that this problem is known to the reception for more than a month time and they do not use this room anyway the story had a happy end the next receptionist changed my room apologized about his colleague and was extremely helpful during my days of stay so migara thank you for everything it is really a pity that the image of such a pretty hotel can be so easily destroyed by a bad receptionist
