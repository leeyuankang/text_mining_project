there is a lot that we didn t like during our stay everything began upon check in when instead of a deluxe king room we were placed in a room for disabled persons when we came back to complain we were told by a arrogant receptionist that hotel is fully booked and that there is no other room for us after discussing for more then minutes we decided to check on the site of booking com are there any rooms available at the property on our dates and as we thought there were plenty of rooms available at their hotel finally after showing that to the employee they agreed to change us the room but we had to wait until they clean it we weren t also satisfied with the cleaning service cause in my opinion the floor in the room hasn t been cleaned for days and if you wanted to take a shower you had to do it quickly because after min you would ran out of hot water so definitely a hotel i would not come back under any circumstances
