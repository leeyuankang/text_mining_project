the facilities and services they offered when you booked was totally inaccurate they didn t offer a laundry or dry cleaning service like stated the didn t offer bike rental like stated instead they referred you to where you could hire bikes there was no explanation of the breakfast they served the next day and they couldn t really offer any tourist information to you although the rooms are clean and modern we were shocked that there was no curtain in the bathroom so the apartment block next door could see directly in while you where on the toilet or in the shower and as for the shower the water cuts in and out it would turn off for then you d have to wait till it come back on when we complained about that we didn t get the response of hotel nothing was done at all and the wifi was not reliable at all kept cutting in and out
