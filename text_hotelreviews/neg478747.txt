half an hour prior to closing the breakfast table there were no options left no bred no scrambled eggs no ham no warm milk no coffee no tea no yogurts the overall options were indeed very nice and diversified however the fact that three were no refills at least half an hour prior to the closing time was quite disappointing the waiters seemed overwhelmed with the number of guests on the mornings we were there maybe more staff or a better separation to refill and withdraw dirty dishes from empty tables would cover that lapse
