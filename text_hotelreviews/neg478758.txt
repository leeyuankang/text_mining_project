the staff were extremely rude unhelpful and only interested in business people with extreme amounts of power and money just felt invisible at one point we waited over mins to get a drink in the delightful gardens when we were the only people there the room we booked was supposed to have a balcony but it didn t it was also supposed to have a bath but it didn t so overall although the hotel area was quiet and well situated we would not go back to this hotel as were very disappointed
