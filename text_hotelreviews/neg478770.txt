i booked a room for nights for my partner and myself i made sure to point it out on the reservation and put both names there i even called the hotel a few days before to confirm upon arriving i was told i had to pay an extra per night because this was a room for that was very disappointing to have to pay that much extra money i could have spent somewhere else for a surprise week end with my wife to be very disappointing to have been misled like this
