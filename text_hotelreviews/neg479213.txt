the balcony in the room was very depressing with no view at all and no table and chairs outside if you want to see something form your balcony you have to lay down on the balcony floor some lights were not working in the room as well they did not tell us about the milan charge when we checked in or even on their website which is per person a night they only tell you when you go to check out that you need to pay it
