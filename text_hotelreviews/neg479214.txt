it s not value for money and to be frank this is probably one of the worst experience i had in star hotels the bathroom shower was not really working well and the shield of the shower is also broken we are guests but in the room everything was prepared for one person including slippers and towels there was one free bottle of water when we check in but just one and no more in the second day spa seems not accesible and it comes as a surprise breakfast is not up to continental level and there is not much service in the restaurant staff was not helpful and i literally see no smile on any of them and i even got a weird looking when we request some service you can see staff here was not really trained motivated to attend to the customer to the detail but rather simply perform the routine there is also this big cell tower by the room we stayed and there is no view outside of the window i don t really want to be some needy customer who always ask for dream experience in a hotel where you are just suppose to sleep in it s simply that i would expect more with a star hotel when i spent the money and that the peer hotel with same cost simply provides much better stay experience
