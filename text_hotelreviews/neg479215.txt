the day we reached there was dust in the hotel room the day we had to leave a enormous problem and misunderstanding happened we payed for our stay the first day then we used room service and so on the last day we went on the reception to pay our bills for the room service and they told a sum of money we considered small for what we actually had consumed we asked ten times re you sure that this is all that tomorrow morning when we check out we wont have anything else to pay unless we use room service again of course and the answer was yes then the next morning we found ourselves in a trap you need to pay the last night we had spent all our money shopping the previous day and we had payed all of the nights in the day we checked in to sum it up they took from our paid stay money for the room serive which i happen to experience the very first time in my life in a hotel so if this is hotel policy this is a total absurd if it is a personnel mistake well nobody took the responsibility nor compensated us in any words i loved the hotel but this made me think twice if i would visit it ever again
