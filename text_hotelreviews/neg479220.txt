i booked this hotel due to its location and spa no booking com description or my booking confirmation says that spa sauna is not included in the rate i had to pay euros for a star spa i guess this is one of the ways how this hotel generates additional cash the response from the reception was like this is how it is they clearly understood that this information was not explicit on facilities description or in my booking but didn t want to provide free access to spa
