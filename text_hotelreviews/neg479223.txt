first of all i want to start with saying that the melia milano hotel on via masaccio is beautiful and has great potential but i m very sorry to say that some thing has gone terrible wrong when it comes to the staff and service i am a used traveler and i only stay at star hotells when i do with over travel days a year i thought i could with confident say that i had seen it all until this trip i have never felt the need to give a bad review or sending a e mail like this but this time i just can t let this go without pointing out all the flaws that we had during our stay in room from december to january i would never send this unless the personal did not take my points seriously and just nod and walk away first of all the cleaning is really bad we arrived to dusty room with dust on the glas and mirror in the bathroom letting it go and hoping that when they clean the room it will be taken care off to our surprise when we come later the first night we see that its still dusty and only bed and towels has been changed and trash has been missed thats been in the middle of the room i decide to not make a big deal about this and decide to clean it myself this type of problems has kept turning up during our stay at the hotel personal forgetting to take used coffee muggs and food from the room the personal even forgot to refill the minibar for days straight this is when i felt the need to call down to the reception and point out the flaws and just get hited back with excuses and promises that it will be taken care off one more day passes and still no refill in the minibar or properly cleaned room i decided to make a little test to see if i m over reacting and ordered food from the room service wich arrived cold i ate it any way and placed the tray outside the door around lunch time the january when i arrive back to the hotell later in the evening i see the tray is stil there its more then hours later
