we were not informed on check in or the next day that work was taking place next to the room we were in hoping for a lie in as it was our last day before we travelled back to the uk we were woken up at around to the sounds of hammering and drilling when we checked out and queried it we were told that emergency work needed to be carried out in the room next to us but i don t understand why no one could have called us or knocked our door to inform us of this we were terribly inconvienienced and the best the hotel could do was say we can offer you a free coffee or tea in the bar considering how much we paid for the room and the fact that we weren t told in the morning about the work was terrible
