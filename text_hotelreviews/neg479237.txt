you would expect the rooms to be impressive too but the contrary is a fact the lousy furniture lack of a carpet and missing wall design give impression of a star hotel at most the airconditioning was not cooling the terrace if you could call it that wasn t more then a prison cage with no more view then a concrete wall right in front of your nose and a dozen of old soaked sigaret budds on the floor the sandpaper sheets made it impossible to sleep without oijamas and socks
