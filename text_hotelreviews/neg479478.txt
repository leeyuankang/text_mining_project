as the hotel is exactly in the center of milano it s impossible to park a car although the hotel has a parking but it doesn t work late at night and nobody is there to even take your car and park it all the parkings around that the hotel cooperates with we re closed as they told us after hour searching around the center area trying maybe to leave it somewhere with pay timer nothing was working and you couldn t leave it for many hours after searching for a parking spot through my gps and internet i finally found parking that was close enough about meters and left it there actually i did not like that they only called the parkings that they were cooperating with and not searching for another parking as i did and i found easy after words the second bad thing is that most of the rooms don t have very good windows so the noise outside can be heard the tram passes a lot so you hear it and it s a crowdy area so it s a bit noisy either wise
