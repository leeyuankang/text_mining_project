we ordered prior to our trip to have a mercedes pick us up via the hotel we were assured the driver would be waiting at the airport but after a hour flight the driver was nowhere to be found i had to purchase an international plan on my personal mobile phone and call the hotel to check on the driver the staff called back ten minutes later stating the driver was not coming and we would have to take a taxi not being familiar with the taxis and the customs we ended up having to pay an outrageous euro it was unacceptable and it took too much pulling to find out why the driver didn t show i spent way too much money for night stay to have the driver not show and cause extra euro
