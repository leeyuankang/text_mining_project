the toilet had no privacy my room was on the first floor and it had big balcony doors that weren t safe and one of them didn t actually lock i called the customer service to check it out and they did they said that they will have someone to fix it soon i left the next day so i don t know if its fixed the sound proof i can hear everything happening on the road the price is extremely expensive i guess because of its location
