the hotel lobby and dining room was too cold in temperature during my entire visit i also didn t like that the dining room moved to an auxiliary room on some nights due to convention groups being at the hotel this made me feel less valued than other guests you should have more than person assisting in the check in process this made a poor impression on me there was no apology for the delay and the check in person said nothing about the amenities of the hotel i had to ask questions and she seemed impatient finally my luggage had been lost by the airline i informed the hotel reception that the airline found my bag and would deliver it to the hotel since all of my clothes were in the list luggage i implored the hotel representative to contact me when it arrived as i was desperate to change my clothes i was told the hotel would follow through i kept checking throughout the day and night and the hotel said they didn t have my bag i checked with the airline and they indicated that the bag had been delivered to the hotel some time ago i went to the reception to inquire again and at first they said it hadn t arrived i asked if they could check again and they found it none of the fine hotels i have visited throughout the world would treat guests in this manner i am very disappointed with novotel
