room was not very clean huge stain on the carpet hallway smelled moldy extremely rude restaurant staff member i had just walked off stage the night before in rome and ran for the train in the morning so no dinner and no breakfast when i arrived at the hotel at pm the restaurant had been closed for minutes all the bar could offer was sandwiches and i was dying for some sort of a hearty pasta meal the front desk staff arranged for me to have a little bit of lasagna and bread i sat in the restaurant and the man who worked at the restaurant seemed pissed that i was there and was extremely rude i thanked him profusely it s not like he had to stay past his shift the front desk took pity on a starving opera singer and he was rude i was willing to eat anything he had in the kitchen
