fire alarm which was a test and the hotel did not inform us before and it made us feel panic and confused we leaved our room scarily when the alarm started and then we asked the staff what is going on they just said it was a test and they put information on the check in desk which we did not see it before and we did not know every they we have to go in checking desk to get info like this also the staffs were not friendly and helpful the room was hot and it was not possible to change the temperature because of old system which the staff told us and there were no air conditioner they told us it works only in summer the location was not good because for reaching the city centre we have to take a train which last at least minutes long and the train plan was also not regular which is not the fault of hotel and in this case we had to pay more attention to the distance
