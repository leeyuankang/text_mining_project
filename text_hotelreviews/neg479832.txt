the rooms are run down a bit and the ac was off in the whole hotel rooms were too stuffy and too hot to be bearable it took a few hours for someone to come and open the window which was jammed and did not have a screen to prevent insects from coming into the room shower heads needed maintenance my feeling was that the hotel needed better maintenance of the rooms over all i would not recommend sleeping there
