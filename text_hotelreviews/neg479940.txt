this was rated as a star hotel but was star at best the rooms were small and cramped the bathroom shower was minuscule and leaked water the air conditioner was not programmable and the room was incredibly hot overnight the window had a blackout cover that could not be fully opened so the windows couldn t be opened to provide a breeze or full sunlight the location and price were good so balanced these negative factors somewhat
