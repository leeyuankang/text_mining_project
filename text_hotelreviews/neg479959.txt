very noisy hostel nearby its like trying to fall asleep while your neighour is having a party the noise continues till am rooms are quite small and look rather old fashioned and would benefit from renovation all in all carrobio looks like a fair star definetly not the star hotel which explains the price that is quite low for such a central location
