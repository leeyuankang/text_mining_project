there are things i did not like the internet was very slow nobody told us that at a stars hotel the tourist tax is euro per day and per person adding euro per day to the room rate the receptionist tried to push us to order an unreasonably expensive limousine service at a rate more than double that of milan public cabs there was only one night stand with one night light for two beds and the second bed was arranged with the pillow on the opposite side of the night stand which was was bit weird there was only a heavy comforter and no light sheet to use even if it is summer
