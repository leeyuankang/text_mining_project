the place itself is not kept up well my room was small and cramped little things like it was difficult to turn on the shower without getting wet with cold water because of the location and direction of the shower nozzle and the type of shower door i had two very awkward and inappropriate exchanges with staff a cleaning person opened my door while i was in the room without knocking and heeding my requests to not come in why she was trying to enter was completely unclear another staff member at the lobby desk tried to convince me to let him take me to the airport in his private car not official hotel car vehicle instead of taking a licensed taxi as a young woman i felt very suspect of his motivations i would never stay in this place again
