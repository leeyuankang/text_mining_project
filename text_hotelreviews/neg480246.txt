i was very disappointed with one thing in particular i have requested a small extra as we were celebrating my partner s birthday it could have been anything i e a birthday card note chocolate bottle of wine anything would have made a big difference i have worked in tourism for several years and i have never come across a hotel that failed to provide even the smallest gesture bed lamps not working bed was squeaking speaker in the bathroom not working i was charged twice on my stay one time from the credit card used to make the booking and another time when checking out as i opted to use another card to pay for my full stay it is not what one would expect in a competitive accommodation market like milan would not book again
