overall crowne plaza milan city was a nice hotel and met my needs for a quick weekend getaway to milan however there is a bar club nearby which has an outside patio which was quite loud on a saturday night even with the windows closed you could still hear the noise also the fitness center was very small and had limited options not a huge deal as the weather was nice outside but maybe not as suitable for a traveller looking to utilize the space a bit more
