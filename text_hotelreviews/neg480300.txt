the room was tiny the shower was very cramped we were given a corner room at the end of a hallway and there was barely enough room to walk around the bed my boyfriend s feet were literally hanging over the bed it was that small we had asked for a quiet room and the room was supposed to be sound proof however we could hear everything outside every person in the hallway the elevators cleaners vaccumming it was too noisy we felt like the price per night was too high and wasn t worth it overall not a bad hotel but probably will not stay again
