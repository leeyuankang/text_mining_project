the location not close to the city center at all it takes around minutes walking and when choosing to go by subway we had to exchange subways and walk an extra minutes not sure why it has city center in the name there was no option to get single beds in a standard double room which was inconvenient for us not being couples also when it came to a second blanket there was this extra blanket in the closet the smelled pretty bad and was kind of itchy i would suggest cleaning those once in a while we also had a triple room and that was the exact same size as the double room but with one extra bed that s just blocking the couch and if you calculate the price per person it more expensive than the price per person in a double room another minus for us was the bathroom you get either extremely hot or extremely cold water in the shower it takes a while to get it to be a nice medium also the appliances there need some renewing there was something below the sink that was just about to fall off
