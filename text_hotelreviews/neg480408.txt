room ac was not working after complaining staff refused to repair or change my room citing hotel fully booked though rooms were available instead they provided small fan in the room i didnt wish to escalate further as it was my last day of the trip and didnt want it to end on bad notes the hotel should take guest complaint seriously because we dont stay free there we pay and stay so they dont do any favour by providing room to us i had paid for a ac room n not room with fan staff dont take guest complaints seriously
