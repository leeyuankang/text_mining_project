with the exception of one great lady at the front desk the rest of staff we encountered varied from cordial to cold the food at dinner was big disappointment as was the slow service couple sat there waiting for someone to take our orders my lasagna was cold hotel is in middle of china town and can be loud at night in fact for over hours a group of chinese folks were yelling at each other across from our window making it impossible to sleep we were in italy for weeks and our bed at this hotel was by far least comfortable we read all the great reviews and is why we grabbed the room it is a good value considering overall
