i am pleased i took a taxi from the station which cost me euros take care not to be ripped off with stories of a set charge being requested my driver wanted euros the area that the hotel is in gives little comfort to single travellers who may use tram and then walk which was one suggestion made i admit i made a mistake in selecting this location from central station
