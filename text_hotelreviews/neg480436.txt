staff s behaviour was not respectfully and they didn t try their best to solve the problems the internet connection via wifi was awfull laundry service was disappointed as they mentioned that on sunday they could not give any service and from saturday till monday afternoon i had to wait for a simple laundry the price for this level of service and facility is too much
