the hotel is a bit far from most of the main sights for summer tourists in hot milan it was less convenient and a bit exhausting sometimes on our last day one of the receptionists didn t give us a full information about traveling somewhere and this mistake had cost us lots of money if we would have known we wouldn t have chosen to travel to the place
