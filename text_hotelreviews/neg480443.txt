the shower was leaking to the floor as it was located in a bath with not a wide enough glass to cover the water spray also beware that the hotel has smoking floors that have a very heavy smoke smell in the rooms and halls so this can be a problem for non smokers in high seasons luckily we had a chance to change for non smoking floor room so this didn t get a problem for us
