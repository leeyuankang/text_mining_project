we had to check out a day early due to an unexpected emergency still the hotel clerk at the front desk insisted we d pay full price for the unused night according to their policy even though we explained wasn t their problem they just wanted us to pay for the room whether we d use it or not thanks a lot there isn t even a place in front of the hotel that allows for unloading loading luggage at check in check out and this on a very busy intersection one is always at the mercy of the local police to get to the hotel parking one must drive about blocks into an underground parking structure the hotel obviously has some sort of arrangement with parking is per day the duomo is a brisk walk of good minutes away and to get to the brera zone where most of the better restaurants are located its an additional minutes the fashion district is even farther although there are shops nearer they seemed to cater more to tourists all in all a disappointing experience
