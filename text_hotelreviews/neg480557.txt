i think the two biggest downsides were the fact that even though we had a queen size single bed it actually has two mattresses side by side making the sleep very uncomfortable if you re staying in the middle in days we didn t have our soap shampoo or similar items changed at all unfortunately we were returning quite late in the hotel so i didn t have the chance to ask for new ones regardless it should be a default action for a stars hotel
