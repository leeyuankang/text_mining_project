we spent a night in a euro suite the hotel is located at a crossroad with heavy traffic day and night the room was relatively small and narrow as the hotel itself as you don t open the windows to the noisy street and you get breakfast in the cellar you ll never see daylight in this hotel when we had a missunderstandig with the reservation the friendly man at the welcome desk did not even try to get in touch with booking com at last we learned that it needs more than a couple of old furnitures in a hotel to have charme do not expect too much of this stars hotel
