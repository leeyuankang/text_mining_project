the smaller bedroom where husband slept had extremely hard mattress and full foam pillow so sleeping was more difficult the tv comes on to italian station when entering room and we don t even like that in our home the controls for the tv were difficult to figure out and there were no instructions that we found we did not find a local guide book of suggestions in our room which would have been nice the ice machine requires bothering the front desk to get it filled which means waiting if the person is busy
