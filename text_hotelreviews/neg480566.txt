this has nothing to do with the hotel but we got a cab from the train station to the hotel we only had the name of the hotel not the address the cabbie was very annoyed at us made a big deal of telling us hotel names change so much asked a number of other cab drivers if they knew the hotel one did so we got there fine about our advice have the address with you as well
