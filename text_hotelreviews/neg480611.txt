we arrived on a game night the hotel was extremely disappointing it started with the parking was full although their website specifically states that guest do not need to reserve parking in advance and finding a place outside was stressful as one need to be lucky to find parking outside on game night the room was the smallest we ever got in italy for persons and it had a bad smell of smoking although we asked for nonsmoking the service was surprisingly poor staff were simply indifferent to any request we ve had including assistance with departing early next morning we arrived min early for breakfast and they made us wait although everything was ready and we needed to depart to catch a flight the only one who really tried his best was the bellhop who assisted us with taking the luggage to our room the elevator didn t work that night and did his best to get the bad smell out of the room as the people in the counter couldn t or were not willing to to move us to a different room
