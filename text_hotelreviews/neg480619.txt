i like the woman at reception desk at at pm she is very nice but after i checked in my friends came to the hotel at that night very very very unhappy experience for me at pm the reception desk man looks tall and fact firstly he asked my friend for the passport and she started to find it in her wallet maybe just let him to wait second long then he long breath through this nose it gives my feeling that he is impatient after my friend checkin in he gave us the room card one of my friend was busying organizing her staff and another one was taping message on her phone i try to took the room card for her but the man did not give to me i think the really know we are friend and the two girls were in the reception desk very close to me i just want to help them for the card but so is that the rule of the hotel plus the wifi in the room never can connect but the room is clean others but that man are really nice
