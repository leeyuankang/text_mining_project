the shower it was only a hand spray which you had to hold while having a wash it was not fixed to the wall or no hook to hold it this hotel was classed as star on the sign outside but i dont think it was star at the most the breakfast was very expensive for what they had on offer at each no cooked food it was only on the last morning that we eat there just as well the safe in our room did not work either which i was very disappointed as most hotels these days have a safe it could be that we were just unlucky with our room
