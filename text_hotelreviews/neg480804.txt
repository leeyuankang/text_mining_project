i cant t recommed this hotel becauce the air conditioning was turned off in the middle of the night so it was so hot there in the room we thought at first it was broken but it wasn t they just said now it s working and it did work cause they didn t turn it off anymore but it was old it didn t cool the air enough we felt like in prison and like they woudn t appreciate at all your stayin at a hotel moreover there were dozens of tiny little ants especially in the bathroom but they moved across the room the bathtub was just awful it needed to replase to new one the bath s faucets were so old that you needed to shower lots of water there were one for warm and one for cold water we almost pulled the stiring in the bathroom only in case of emergency the furniture needs to updating i wanted to get an axe and redecorate the room this hotel is only a three star hotel not four the price was too much for this room
