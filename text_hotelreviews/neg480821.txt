there were some hair in the bathroom floor when we entered and some more in the bathtub the ceiling cover in the bathroom needs imrovement but it wasn t very disturbing the rooms do not offer soundproof and the plumbing could be noisy when someone was in there and on our departure morning early around o clock in the morning for about an hour there was a lot of noise underneath our balcony probably from suppliers some more napkins on the breakfast table would be nice
