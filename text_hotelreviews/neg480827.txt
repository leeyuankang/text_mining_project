when i checked in i was expecting some mail to be delivered at the hotel and i had even called the hotel prior to my arrival to make sure they would put it aside for me they ended up returning the first letters that arrived before my check in date and so i was missing work documents for my trip it wasn t the end of the world but did annoy me a little bit since i had previously called to make sure this wouldn t happen
