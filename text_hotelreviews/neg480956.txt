we asked for a quiet room and got a room facing the back it was an unusual set up with a bathroom with a very large frosted window and a glass frosted sliding door there were street lights close to the bathroom window and the rooms bathroom and bedroom were full of light at night we couldn t darken the bedroom there were no blinds or curtains on the bathroom window and we couldn t sleep because of the unusual design there was a step between the bedroom and the bathroom dangerous we were continually tripping going in and out of the bathroom the air conditioning didn t work properly at all even when we set the temperature at degrees because of the way the room was set up the circulation was poor we ended up sweating despite the air conditioning
