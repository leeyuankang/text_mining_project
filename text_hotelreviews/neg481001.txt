the only criticism is that the toiletries provided were a little basic one bottle of liquid soap and one bottle of shampoo bath gel the shampoo did not suit my hair so i would take my own next time it would have been nice to have conditioner and body lotion i took my own to be on the safe side so i didn t ask for any so i can t say whether the hotel would have provided them on request or not
