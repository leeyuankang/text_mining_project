we stayed in hotel berna some five years ago and were very satisfied because of the friendly service so we booked it now again without even looking at other hotels when we arrived with two big suitcases backbag etc in the afternoon we were not greeted by a smile but a statement that we had already checked in as if we had done something wrong it did not start well but thanks to cesare everything was made good again
