there is actually nothing to complain about it was a little bit weird at first when i was told that my room is not in this building it is in another building accross the street but don t worry it is the hotel s property as well not because there is no room in the main building or something else i just had to go to main building for breakfast but it wasn t a problem walking seconds more that s it i can also say that hairdryer could be better
