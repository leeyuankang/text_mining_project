i know it might be normal in milano but sorry this place is way to expensive for what it offers i am not saying in comparison to other hotels in milano just in comparison to my general feeling after travelling for years the people working at the reception are not exactly angels of politeness but we got along location was good if you were merely passing through milano but a bit far from the center if you want to avoid metros about minutes walking
