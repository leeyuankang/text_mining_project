my single superior room was rather small problems with the water on first night some items in the bathroom a bit too much for fashion than functionality for my liking shower only in bathroom no bath frosted glass bathroom door was less effective at keeping out noise from neighbouring bathroom than a solid one would have been nothing seriously wrong but on balance think i preferred the deluxe single i had earlier in the week
