room walls itself in the opposite blue building are indeed soundproof as mentioned and you cant hear any other guests however the windows are not that well isolated everything can be heard from the bar just next to the building until they close which is at around that s why one minus point since i often sleep late it s not that much of a problem but anyone who needs it quiet and wants to sleep before midnight should keep that in mind
