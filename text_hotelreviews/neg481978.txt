we have a problem with noises from other rooms especially at night time there were a constant dragging and banging sound from the ceiling and the walls the reception kindly moved us to a higher floor but the problem still persists this could have been a really nice stay for the fact that the room was newly decorated and clean will definitely look for hotels with soundproof tag next time
