i booked for nights but i checked out at early morning one day earlier because my schedule changed and the receptionist would charge me for nights i did not accept such charge and argued with the receptionist she finally did agree to charge to charge only nights and the noise from next room and from the door and very disturbing and night i would not return this hotel
