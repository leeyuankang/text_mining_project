charged us extra for kids upon check in couldn t cancel our reservation upon checking in so forced to pay and stay because we were too tired after a long flight with kids we wished we were staying at glam milan it is more conveniently located looked nice from outside not accessible with luggages and strollers so this poor assigned staff has to help guest with carrying their items facility itself is less than impressive upon first view and our room was dust though we had to stay for them to get it ready reception staff fast and business like and not welcoming at all
