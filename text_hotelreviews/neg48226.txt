for the price you pay and the fact that it is a star hotel i find it disappointing that they give you rooms in the basement that have windows looking into the corridor and you feel like the underground is passing right next to you feom the noise luckily after my first complaint to the hotel at the next day they moved me to a higher floor in a matter of seconds the staff was very helpful but in my opinion hotels with should not have guests on lower ground rooms overlooking the corridor
