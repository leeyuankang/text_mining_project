rather than boutique the essence of the hotel is actually bijou my room was small no space for a chair and no convenient place from which to watch the television the en suite contained a shower but no bath from the spacing of doors along the corridor it was clear that the other rooms were no larger the staff were helpful but with a touch of a mixture of obsequious and supercilious i have stayed in more congenial hotels in the area for half the price
