the room showed in booking com does not match the type of room we thought we would get we had to get an upgrade to be in the nice rooms the service was absolutely terrible except for or women in the reception at the time of check out all other employees in reception were absolutely zero help and one even was making comments about my nationality it seems they did not study hospitality at all the restaurant does not have a restaurant to serve room service the breakfast was poorly made sandwiches were not appropriate for a so called stars hotel i can continue this list forever but i will stop here
