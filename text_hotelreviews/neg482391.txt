the room had a very old and dusty carpet our phone screen was full of dust only after a few minutes we came inside the room i advised the hotel i was allergic to dust and she said that the room i paid for all of them have carpets inside if i haven t paid in advance with no refund i would have changed straight away also the hotel was classified as a stars hotel but when i called reception at pm to request a blanket i was informed it was not possible to get one as the receptionist was completely alone in the hotel and he could t get the blanket i offered to get it at reception but the blanket was in a storage room he couldn t access i was cold and with allergy all night couldn t sleep and when i reported the experience to the receptionist she didn t know about the incident and didn t even apologize very poor service and room conditions it is definitely not a stars hotel
