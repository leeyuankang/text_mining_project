if i would say one negative it would be that the rooms downstairs do hear a fair amount of noise through the ceiling when guests come through the front door it is not all the time and not enough to warrant a room change but it is a shame it is so well sound proofed from wall to wall but there is that slight noise there honestly though this is finding a minor fault and not something that would put me off staying
