horrible reception service no one could suggest me an available laundry for an emergency and this happened during fashion week so i ended up asking for laundry at westin nearby a receptionist couldn t give us any suggestion about a place for dinner and finally gave an indication for a place after googling that turned out to be closed i was preparing for an important evening and i had my friend passing by to help me my room was booked for two but she wasn t the second guest the hotel didn t allow her to come upstairs even for an hour in a very rude manner she didn t visit the room didn t see it as they wanted and definitely will never stay at this hotel neither will i
