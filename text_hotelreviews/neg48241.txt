the room service was very simple and was only a range of four sandwiches when i rang to get some room service there did not have any of the four sandwiches that there stock we also went to the bar to have a pre drink before we went out for dinner and the bar and restaurant are very small and was really just a room set up for afternoon teas and breakfast
