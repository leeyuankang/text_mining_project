we booked superior rooms and only got of it because the staff let other people stay longer in our room to be honest if not because the superior room i wouldn t choose to stay at this hotel because the standard rooms are very old the most unpleasant about this stay is the front desk staffs not only they didn t give the rooms we booked and didn t apologies nor give us compensation staying here make me feel like i own them something with their fake smile and poor attitude i wouldn t recommend anyone to stay here not only my group that has problem while i was trying to work things out at the front desk there was also other guest complaining with the similar problem we stayed for nights and right on the first day i ask to talk to the manager they said he she will come tomorrow for days that i have been told the same old lie that he is coming tomorrow and he has never show up worst experience of hotel in italy for me i am doing an itaian luxury gourmet tour for years and this hotel is the worst i have ever stay in italy
