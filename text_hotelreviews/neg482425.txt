this is really a star hotel star is an over statement the room is tiny don t be mislead by the nicely done photos the bathroom is really bad with very old facilities it is close to the train station and the area is not nice the location of this hotel doesn t really add much benefit at all as there is nothing to see in its neiboughood at all
