the dials for the heating system should have been explained to us the heating was blowing cold so my husband turned a dial up thinking it was for the room but when we returned to our room it was still cold but when i walked into the bathroom with bare feet i thought the floor was was on fire so i turned the dial down again and sure enough the under floor heating in the bathroom cooled down
