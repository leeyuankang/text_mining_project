straight off the bat this review is based on a single occupancy room its size was extremely small more for a child than an adult the bed was tiny and caused many a restless night as i found myself hanging out of it mouldy food was in the fridge on arrival management were informed but wasnt removed the tv did not work and so a spot of sensless telly couldnt be enjoyed in the evening this was primarily down to the sky box and tv requiring two plug sockets but only had been installed the logic unfortunately was also lost upon location of the key card holder for the lights which meant you couldnt open the door without taking it out the sink was blocked and the floor felt and looked unclean keep those shoes on people there was no safe which was quite irritating as i didnt feel at ease to leave my passport in the room being situated on the ground floor and next to reception also heightened the feeling of insecurity the interactive control for the ac and dnb was extremely temperamental
