the rooms were tiny and very stuffy unfortunately the air conditioning was broken so staff advised us to open windows that was fine for those sleeping at the back of the building but impossible to maintain at the front because of street noise on top of this the walls were very thin so we could hear our neighbours personal and intimate goings on not good there were no tea or coffee making facilities in the room and no tissues provided the tv screen was very small and there were no channels in languages other than italian and yet the hotel caters for a language diverse client group the hotel was partly chosen because it has facilities for those with disability however there was a small flight of steps inside the hotel before you reached the elevator the bathrooms were also tiny so much so that you almost had to stand on the wc before you could close the door and when entering or leaving the shower you had to step over the wc again not good for those who might be unsteady on their feet vision impaired etc
