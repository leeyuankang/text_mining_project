i booked an enhanced room with a bath tub according to the pictures of the room and a bedroom and a little living room however on the reception i was offered a suite for extra payment only when declined i eventually was given a plain only bedroom accommodation with a shower cabin it is never said that the enhanced room has to be a suite or has a bath tub but the pictures are confusing
