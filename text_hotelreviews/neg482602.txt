this is not a star standard hotel i was there with my two grown up kids and their room was a small box which was eventually changed there was bird muck all over our balcony the next door room had a collapsed balcony for the first few days we had a problem with our safe and despite mentioning on three or more occasions it still didn t work when we left there s no tea or coffee making facilities in the room not one international news or english speaking channel no help on offer for luggage completely understaffed and reception staff appear to be in a constant state of exasperation i would suggest due to a lack of experience and or training per day for pool towels an empty mini bar and if you asked them to then fill it so you ca use it then they charge a per day service fee when phoning the reception no one ever answered overall the exterior of the building is very tired rusty frames on the balconies no attempt to clean the place up paint faded or peeling chips of building material were all over our balcony or was that bird i will not be returning and would not recommend this hotel to anyone
