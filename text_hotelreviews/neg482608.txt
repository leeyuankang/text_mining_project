we had some problems first we wanted take a bath as soon as we got there because we were so tired from traveling but the plug in the bathtub didn t work well so we called the reception and they sent the plumber and he changed the plug even though we couldn t draw the bath so we asked to change the room they changed the room but that room didn t have the bathtub and smelled like cigarette so bad so we asked to change the room again and they said they don t have spare room so in the end we ended up staying the first room it took two hours to decide the room but they never apologized of course they changed us for the normal price and the mini bar and when we tried to take a bath we realized there was only one set of towels and bathrobe even though we booked for two persons so i called the reception and asked i m so sorry to bother you but may i have another towel as i don t speak italian and the lady said something i couldn t hear it so i said sorry but she just hung up that was so rude i didn t want to try again so i gave up and after that in the night we asked for toothbrush this time my boyfriend asked in italian and the man came to my room so i said gazie but he said nothing that moment i decided to write this review i ve been stars hotel stars hotel b b apartment etc but this hotel didn t feel like stars hotel even though we stayed superior room the furniture looks old the bath room s tiles were cracked the service was terrible as i wrote they didn t even say hello to us when we ran into them in the hallway maybe we expected too much but this hotel was terrible i feel so stupid that i wrote this long but that s why i really don t recommend here please consider another place
