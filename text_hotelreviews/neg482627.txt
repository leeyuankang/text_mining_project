very rude personnel the lady in the reception told us to park our car to hotel s garage because it is not safe outside she said it is very dangerous neighborhood and anything could happen to our car if we park outside if it is such dangerous why would anyone want to stay there the hotel s parking lot is euro per night btw also the hotel charged the city tax twice we paid the city tax in cash and later found out they also charged our credit card it s been one week and no refund later i went through the comments of this hotel and read they overcharged many other customers the staff in the reception and breakfast lobby were very very rude no wi fi at all bad shower not a good breakfast very dated room we don t suggest this hotel at all it was a terrible experience
