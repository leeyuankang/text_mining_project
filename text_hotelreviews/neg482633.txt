the breakfast was probably the worst european breakfast i ve ever had amongst a tray full of bacon fat and a few chopped hot dogs they regularly had no coffee which was tasteless no water or juice asking the waiters waitresses to fill these up were your only hope the bar had only member of staff which took minutes to be served he tends to like to serve people at once then forgetting what it is he is supposed to be doing the price of a beer moretti is which is dearer than some central places the hotel also doesnt provide an iron so if you ve bought yourself a nice outfit and have packed it like any other human be prepared to walk round milan with creased garments
