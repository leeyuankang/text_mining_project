where to start first of all the room was nothing like the pictures advertised here they looked old used and had scratch marks pretty much everywhere on the floor and furniture i looked again on the booking website to see if any of the rooms were like the ones we got and i could not find any at some particular time my card was charged for something from the room i did not have anything consumed yet they did charge it i got lucky i had sms notification and asked them to refund but if it wasn t then what would it be also i had a blocked amount on the initial card i had for the booking and at arrival since i did not have that original card with me the total amount of booking has been blocked on another card the unlock depending on your bank lasts for a few days the second day the cleaning lady threw some personal care product of my girlfriend which i find unacceptable also the wi fi was not working so we got hour vouchers for that which is ok but the signal is very bad and the speed is worst than the mobile connection itself
