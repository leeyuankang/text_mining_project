the hotel is located in an industrial part of the city hence not possible to walk around at night and you wouldn t feel safe doing so and use of the parking garage is highly recommended because break ins for curbside parked cars is rampant note there s a fee to use the underground garage and entrance is very narrow any car larger than bmw seires is not recommended
