location is terrifying in the morning there were a lot of cars with broken windows in the putside parking since people there probably coming from the close club did not find anything else to do than stealing all the stuff they saw in the vehicles in the hotel they know about the situation of course since i really don t think it was an isolated case but still they let you pay additional euro to park inside disgusting luckily my car was kot among them but still they broke my wiper just for fun i wouldn t come back there for this reason
