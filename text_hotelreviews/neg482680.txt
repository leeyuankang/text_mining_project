american buffet breakfast consisted only of cold buttery scrambled eggs cold veggies cold mini frankfurt sausages boiled eggs and soft watery bacon definitely not an american breakfast i also cut my lip on a broken glass while having breakfast there was no information provided in regards to the facilities available they didn t charge my card when they were meant to whilst i was in the uk instead they wanted payment at end of stay this meant i got hit with a bad exchange rate and i got charged an exchange free by my card provider the hotel needs a renovation the furniture is old and the outside is falling apart with the greenery not being maintained the location is also in the middle of nowhere and there are no shops around
