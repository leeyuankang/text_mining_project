i was charged two times once on when making the reservation on booking com and once when checking out i wasn t informed that i will be charged second time i think that this is called a fraud when i called the hotel to resolve my issue i was transfered times between their reservation department and the reception and at the end they did nothing to resolve the issue they told me that it was normal and that i have to wait days i was never informed about such thing the stuff is incompetent and has commited a fraud
