i just need to warn everyone that although it says they have a hotel transfer and although we contacted the property regarding this a week before we came to stay there is no such thing it is actually an overpriced taxi that cost three times as much as the room unfortunately we had to get to the airport early and we were an hour from the airport in the middle of nowhere by the time we got here and we could not get a refund for the room and find a new hotel at that late stage so we had no choice but to be gouged by this absolute scam it really left a sour taste in our mouths it was an awful unjustifiably expensive end to our trip
