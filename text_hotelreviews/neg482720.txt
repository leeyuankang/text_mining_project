we booked this place because bookings com said that they have an airport shuttle well they told us they did not have one we had to pay euro for a taxi when checking out hotel charged us for the stay in usd we did not ask for it nor did we want it when we said that we wanted it to be done in euros the person at the desk said i already did it as in you don t have the time to do anything about it there was a convenience fee added to an exchange rate that was already about above market i e extra to create what is actually an inconvenience for us as we are doing the accounting in euro in any case the hotel will nickel and dime you and not provide what is promised the quote was in euro and clearly said airport shuttle i bet they even got a kickback from the taxi driver they called for us not a positive experience
