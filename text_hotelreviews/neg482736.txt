the neighbourhood is very awful there are many thefts around we checked out from the hotel and left our car next street with oyr luggage locked in the baggage we went to duomo for hours then left the city to go to venice during half way we stopped to shop when we opened our baggage it was empty i dont know how they knew there was bags inside and how they managed to open it without any damage to car but they succeed ruining our trip so dont go near by that area
