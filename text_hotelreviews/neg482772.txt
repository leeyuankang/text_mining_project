i ve stayed in this hotel for a number of visits now and was concerned that the range and quality of the breakfast had definitely gone down corn flakes rice krispies and coco pops for cereals is quite pathetic for a hotel i was tempted to take a small roll one morning and could hardly cut it it was so tough as for the scrambled egg i ve honestly never tasted worse poor breakfast
