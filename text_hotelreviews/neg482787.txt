the room was very old fashioned even though we had a superior bedroom more like we live in the s the area where the hotel is is very dirty and looks like a ghetto the staff lied and said that the parking on the other side of the hotel isn t for free but it is on the main road instead they suggested us to use their own parking which is per day we played pool in the hotel and the table was very old and so damaged that it didn t make sense to play at all we tried like times the restaurant was not really nice to have lunch or dinner in there were only a few dishes plus they were incredibly expensive i wouldn t recommend it to anyone all in all i am quite disappointed by the hotel we won t visit the business palace again because it s not worth the money
