we were disappointed with our triple room which was an executive double with an extra added bed all three bed positioned next to each other the extra bed is smaller as size comparing to the other two missing supplies for the third person were quickly brought after we discussed with reception as the room was prepared for two though the bed added fans were noisy and we turned them of at night so it was somehow cold the biggest drawback is that after reserving by debit card and paying with the same card as advised by reception to cancel the preauthorisation the value for two rooms has been withdrawn and at the same time blocked in my account being necessary to wait for days until reservation transaction expiration date
