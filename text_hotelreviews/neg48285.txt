my room is in the basement and thus no view wifi signal may get very weak at times unstable to say the least i d recommend bringing your own portable router as they have an ethernet port for free access note that lancaster gate station will be closed from jan to july so that means it s not as convenient if you want to travel on the central line bond street oxford circus etc though you can still walk to marble arch station in about minutes
