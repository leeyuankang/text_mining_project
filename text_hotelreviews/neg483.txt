i think this may be a london thing judging from other reviews but the rooms and corridors are tiny think small and take away another foot in our room the window didn t close properly the heat didn t work and the bath did not empty when you took a shower very dated apart from the tv if like us you intend not to be in your room much the hotel is adequate but would i stay again not if it was free is the answer
