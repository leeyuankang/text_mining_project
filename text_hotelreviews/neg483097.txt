the room was air conditioned a bit too much the shower was rather weak since the room was right above the entrance the view was not that nice and there was some noise from the entrance and the street wi fi worked well but only one device could connect to it at a time so when i wanted to use it my husband couldn t and vice versa it was our second time staying in the hotel we were given a different room before and we liked it very much which is why we chose to come back and this time it was a bit disappointing
