i had a problem with my bill where they overcharged my credit card after many many emails back and forth they finally admitted they were wrong and would refund me when i did not see the refund they kept telling me to wait and wait to date there has been no refund only lie after lie also the key cards don t work you always have to ask the desk to get in your room mostly it is the lying and the overcharging that was the worst just avoid this place for the sake of your wallet and to ensure a good trip
