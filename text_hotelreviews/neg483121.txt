i stayed in this hotel in november and got a very very hot room as it was sunny and warm outside and the room was facing the sun it was really impossible to stay inside as i could not change the temperature of the room in this hotel temperature is centrally controlled so when i asked to change room in order to get at least one not facing the sun the hotel receptionist started talking very loud almost screaming and saying it was not true that my room was that hot according to him my room temperature was ok and so he could not give me another room we had this super loud discussion and in the end i had to sleep with the window open in november of course the day after i got sick i understand that november is considered winter in milan and so hotels turn the heating on also during the day even if it is super warm outside but you do not expect staff talking to a customer like this in a star hotel the day after i changed hotel stayed in a una one and staff people were super nice and friendly plus i could change my room temperature
