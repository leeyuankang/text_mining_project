the staff could have been a little bit more friendly for example we were not told at check in whether we had breakfast or not we had to ask extra the first evening we came back to the hotel and it turned out that we did have breakfast included you know how it is nowadays you never know what s included and what not we went to try the breakfast once and unfortunately we were pretty late a couple of minutes before closing times however there was still food left at the buffet and we wanted to take a couple of croissants with coffee then one of the waiters came and took the food literally from our hands we found that to be quite unprofessional we didn t go down to breakfast anymore since there were many options around the hotel where you can get a nice italian coffee with a nice panini also the coffee from the coffee machine at the breakfast buffet can hardly be called coffee seriously it s that bad the management should take a look at what they are offering another thing was the knocking on the door at a m from the housekeeping staff this was probably the worst part of our stay since we were exploring the city till late and we always like to walk around and experience things so sleeping in was essential for us unfortunately housekeeping came knocking on the door at a m and a m so there was no sleeping in
