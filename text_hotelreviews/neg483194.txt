too hot in the room due to unseasonably warm weather so we had to keep the window open this meant that the room was very noisy in the night the staff weren t very helpful about this recommending that we just keep the heating off we hadn t turned it on but they could at least have offered us a fan for the stay the breakfast was mediocre for a star hotel better range of bread i e healthier bread and also for the toaster the coffee wasn t very good and the cereal was far too sweet a recommendation would be to offer healthier options lower sugar content and also different types of milk
