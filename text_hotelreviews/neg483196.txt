this hotel was a disappointment it makes me doubt about the entire star system not sure if it is really worth believing in it there s a lack of some basic services here there was no coffee machine or anything to warm up water to make a tea inside the room the tv was tiny and the remote control was not working properly also the room needs a refurbishing it looked a bit but the worst part of the entire experience was the internet it s really slow and it doesn t work in all the rooms to make my flight check in i had to be in the floor hall close to the elevator as it didn t work inside my room nor in the hotel lobby when i tried there i would recommend booking another hotel
