our mini ref did not work had to be replaced problem solved after day it was important because it was very hot july and we needed cold drinks badly other room we booked rooms had defective airconditioning so they had to transfer to another room the following night after a guest checked out hotel was probably full it was inconvenient as we had a long list of places to visit but at least they did something replacement room was better spacious and you can have a massage by a machine while taking a shower they were probably upgraded
