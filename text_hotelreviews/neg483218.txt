upon checkin i ve been welcomed by unfriendly sad receptionists stay away from this hotel however the philipino barman was very friendly they don t answer the phone when you call them a star hotel that doesnt not have any ironing and laundry facility and they dont even provide an iron just incase the guests can use it they didnt even bother to help or assist us on finding a laundry place near by despite telling them that we are here to attend a wedding they responded its basically your problem the tv in the room is very old and the remote is not working this is not a star hotel its a star hotel dont be fooled by the reviews
