the biggest problem is that the bathroom has no ventilation at all no windows no other means of ventilation whatsoever unfortunately this is a common problem in hotels in general so not only that it gets like the sauna in the bathroom but also it is quite annoying that you have to use the toilet in the lobby well if you are sensitive to the smell that stays and won t go away we missed having kettle in the room but those are only for the superior rooms unfortunately the majority of the staff working at the reception was not friendly at all apart from one man we had no problem with the location we knew in advance that it is not in the city centre but it s important to know that it is a minutes walk to the centre the metro station is only minutes walk but you have to change lines in order to get to the centre or you can take the tram which would take you to the centre within minutes
