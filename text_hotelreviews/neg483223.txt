our flight was at am so we had to leave around for the airport we tried for times to pay for the room on the first day but were declined every time saying that it will only take minutes to pay when we leave and surprise at am the pos lines weren t working and because we didn t have any cash left there was a bit of moment of panic for the receptionist in the end we agreed to charge the room through the booking system since they already had the accounts and they got the money on the next day they promised they will pack the breakfast for the next day and we didn t get it although we paid for it no free parking but we could find parking spaces close by euro hour
