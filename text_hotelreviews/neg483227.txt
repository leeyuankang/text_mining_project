the parking was for low height cars we had a thulle on ours so we couldn t get inside also the receptionist told us the price per night for the parking is euros per night but he could arrange it to be euros nights is it a central market we re bargaining in or a star hotel the bathroom had no ventilation nor window so it got pretty humid after taking a shower the breakfast was satisfactory but i ve seen way better in other even star hotels fun fact there was no chocolate cream whatsoever the first hotel i couldn t get my morning nutella sandwich and pay attention the price you see on booking is not the final one turns out you have to pay extra euros person night milan tourist tax apparently which led us to a nice euros in the final payment
