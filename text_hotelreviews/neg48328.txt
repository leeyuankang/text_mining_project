rooms were quite cozy and for people for a week it can get a little tight the breakfast staff and service was a little less friendly than than the rest of the staff at the hotel but i probably wouldn t have noticed if the rest of the staff hadn t been so accommodating and friendly i felt they breakfast servers were in a bad mood compared to the front staff s friendliness and welcoming smiles there was one man he looked like a manager who was very helpful during the morning breakfast times we appreciated his friendliness first thing in the morning
