when we arrived to check in there was a misunderstanding about whether we had made full payment including breakfast actually we had already paid everything ie breakfast hotel tax and tourist tax but the check in staff said that i had paid only for the room and nothing else fortunately i had a credit card statement from my bank to dispute this also luckily on the day we checked out another front desk staff klaudios was on duty and he confirmed that i had paid for everything in advance actually i don t think it was fair for hotel to charge us the tourist tax in advance
