i didn t like the size of my room on the picture for superior room look bigger then standard one but on real i had very small room wich i wasn t happy about breakfast for euro maybe worth it but i can suggest to go outside on the left to friends restaurant which offers quality and quantity for little more money it you don t stay at hotel at all like me and only sleep there is fine bed are little hard for me cz i m not big girl
