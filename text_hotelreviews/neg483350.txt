i had booked half board but it turned out there was no restaurant chef on duty and the basic meal provided by a member of staff was very poor i should have rejected the meal and gone elsewhere looks like there is no evening restaurant trade in which case they should not accept half board bookings to my surprise i was asked to pay for the coca cola i had in the restaurant first time i have booked half board for an overnight stay will not do that again also couldn t control the aircon in my room
