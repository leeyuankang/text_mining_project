emailed staff about airport shuttle twice never got any reply there is a great regular bus that takes you from the airport into the city so we had no problem but one would thing a star hotel would reply to your email a bit noisy airconditing for a star hotel breakfast could have been included in the room rate but this was not a big issue cigarette smoke in the lobby but i guess its italy and they do smoke a lot overall it was a great short stay
