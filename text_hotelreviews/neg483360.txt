beware of booking a room at this hotel our experience was that we where charged double because of an error in booking the room when using booking com the hotel charged us for rooms despite our attempts to explain only room was required at time of check in we had been advised by check in staff that we would only be charged for the room and the problem of the double booking was resolved only on check out to be charged for rooms the booking manager gianfranco refused to accept that we only used the one room and insisted the mistake of a room booking was solely ours and we would be charged fully for a room we did not use because the booking was a non refundable cancellation booking interestingly despite being charged for rooms we where never given a key to the second room after a disagreeable check out we later received an email from the hotel after we had left saying they would issue a voucher for the room paid but not used which can be used in a future stay at the hotel this appears to be disingenuous as we where told by email a voucher would be sent within hours it has now been more than days and we are yet to see this redeemable voucher interestingly this hotel charged my debit card on arrival which is most unusual in addition to this we found that the breakfast was disorganised and the staff clearly disinterested in serving their guest
