hotel did not offer any of the expected amenities such as availability of ice no coffee maker in room no snack or soda machines and most of all no self laundry options these items were available through room service only and of course that means you more than pay for what you get the laundry service is priced by each item i can t remember the exact price but one change of clothes for people would be close to euros i have stayed in very nice hotels in london and had an entire bag of laundry done by more than them for about euros
