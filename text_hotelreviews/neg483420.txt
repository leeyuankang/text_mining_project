breakfast is the same food for the entire week on the day i was dragging myself down for breakfast although hotel is near train station it is located at the end of a carpark alley which makes going back late dangerous we were ladies so being cautious is better i requested for a vacuum as i brought along a vacuum bag for storage yet it seems sooooo impossible to borrow one from them nonetheless they manage to provide one at the end
