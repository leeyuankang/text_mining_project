room very small particularly the bathroom on first evening paid for breakfast for following morning took quite a while to acknowledge us at breakfast we had found our own seat and helped ourselves to cereal before anyone spoke to us they said we hadn t paid for breakfast and took quite a while to sort the problem out which we found quite embarrassing the breakfast which we were served wasn t what we ordered and my husbands scrambled egg was bad spoke to reception to complain and they apologised and refunded the cost immediately so can t fault them the staff in the dining room just need better management if service and eggs had been ok it would have been a good breakfast with plenty of choice
