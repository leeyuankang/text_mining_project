the rooms and bathroom were very small as was the dining and buffet area the noise of people walking above our room was unbearable as was the noise of the tubes running beneath us the pillows were lumpy and the bath mats were a little threadbare and our air conditioner made a terrible noise but thank goodness it was chilly at the time so we hardly needed to use it
