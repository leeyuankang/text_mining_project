had to change rooms times the first time the door wasnt locking another room the shower head was one shower away from knocking the user out one room the lights werent working another the blinds were faulty and another time we were downsized this may be personal but dogs are allowed at breakfast which can be uncomfortable for hygiene reasons but pets are allowed at the hotel so maybe it is to be expected quite expensive to get from malpensa to the hub via taxi over euros however there is the option of coach for euros to milano centrale and a taxi from there to the hub at around euros but of course it takes awhile longer only found a couple restaurants nearby minute walk i would say but i wouldnt recommend it just get the shuttle to morino and get the train to restaurants i believe it is only ranked star because of the gym swimming pool and spa facilities but it didnt feel worthy of a star rating
