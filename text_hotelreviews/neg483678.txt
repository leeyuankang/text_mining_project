the location was in an industrial area which we didn t realise when booking we had to walk from the train station no taxi s to be found anywhere the walk was terrifying burnt out cars everywhere filthy streets and generally not a good place to be with bags and no idea where we were we found out that the hotel had a driver when we got there no places to buy general supplies in the near vicinity this was a conference motel great for that purpose not for tired tourists
