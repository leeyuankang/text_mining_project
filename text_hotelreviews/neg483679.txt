the name the hub is quite ironic as there is nothing central about the hotel while it looks to be easily accessible by train and metro it is actually surrounded by highways and the only way in is by car or taxi around from a close station while staff were helpful it didn t meet our expectations of four stars and it s tired state shocked us for a property under ten years old our air conditioming started leaking into our room which they then shut off leaving us tossing and turning and in the heat having an awful night sleep the finish of surfaces walls was fairly poor and the elevator to the pool and gym was broken down maybe we had bad luck i would highly recommend looking elsewhere for holiday makers as this place in my mind is best suited to business travellers working at the business park close by and with company credit cards to charge their taxis to
