rooms are basically well equipped but coffee machine and heating was not working on the day of arrival heating was fixed coffee machine unfortunately not deluxe room is not very special in comparison to other hotels rooms all in all the price for such a room is far too much and not recommendable also the centro of milano is too far away to make spontaneous trips maybe a good business hotel but not fro private reasons
