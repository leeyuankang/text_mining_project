i arrived at and asked for a toasted sandwich at pm only to be told the chef had closed the kitchen i was given the option to go a bar around the corner that was a bad start went to bed hungry i dislike those hairdryers that one has to continue to press a button for it to work so uncomfortable often hotels forget that women with long hair require an additional smaller towel to dry our hair this once agin reinforces my belief that men are the decision makers i opted not to pay euros for breakfast there were ample coffee bars in the neighbourhood and macdonalds had an offer of cappuccino croissant for euros
