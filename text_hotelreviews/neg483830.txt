the rooms were really small and the aircondition was non functioning with the hot milano summer it was absolutely unbearable to stay in the rooms and i had to lie with wetted towels to even have a couple of minutes of sleep we complained to the staff but they only said that it was to hot for any aircon s to work this is just not true since we had warmer nights and perfect aircon in other cities
