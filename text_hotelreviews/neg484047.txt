the front desk service was terrible even though checkin was at they made us wait until the only front desk staff who was good was the lady who was checking us out she seemed to be someone from the old straff staff and atleast new how to take care of her customers the new management is terrible and should be replaced as this hotel has so much potential and it s really sad that the people are ruining the experience
