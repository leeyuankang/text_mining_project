our bathroom smelt bad something wrong with the pipes it was just our room my friend s room next door didn t have the same issue the manager seemed aware of the problem already but said as the hotel was fully booked there was nothing they could do and sent us a bottle of wine as consolation and that they would send up the housekeeper to spray perfume but she never showed up the room was over euros a night because of design week so kind of expected a bit better standard especially as we were staying nights also thought it was bad form that the staff initially told us on sat night that they were too busy in the bar to bring us room service
