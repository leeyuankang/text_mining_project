my only concern was my room had a window into the hallway in the basement since i was by myself and of short duration it wasn t a big issue i would have liked to know this before hand because the rooms are updated and the bathroom was wonderful it didn t bother me too much but it made the room rather dark as i couldn t open the drape and let in outside light
