breakfast this was disappointing they have juices made from concentrate and if you want to have a fresh juice you have to pay extra same thing for the warm choices you had only scrambled eggs which were not edible really poor quality and if you wanted omelette or poached eggs you had to pay extra this is not good and probably the reason why i will not go back it is like to say i give you cheap things unless you pay extra but in order to sell the room in an easier way i advertise room with breakfast included a suggestion sell the room for euros more but don t do this trick because it looks bad and even other clients around me complained about it
