worst experience in my life the longest check in and check out the hotel bar is very noisy specially if you are in first floor i can guaranty that you hear a full conversation of the people in the bar there is no sound proof i book my room one month before my trip and they block the amount in my credit card and forget to deduct the money so we had a trouble when we check out there s no iron in the room and they force u to send ur clothe to the hotel laundry the staff are not an english specker so it was very difficult to find someone understand what you need and they re not even nice
