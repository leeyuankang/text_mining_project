reception desk could do with being bigger there was only people ahead of me when i was checking in but took at least minutes before i was seen i wish at check in they explained how to get in to your room as upon first arriving as the hallways are quite dark and there is no door handle it took until the cleaner came and helped me that i actually got in the bed was on wheels and as the floor was not carpet the bed moved every time you got in to it or just generally moved in it other than that it was comfortable all in all a lovely stay and would definitely return
