bathroom amenities shampoo hand wash etc are all in one and not very nice i suggest you bring your own shampoo bathroom has a weird echo nice initially but gets tiring after the first time bathroom sounds get amplified if you get what i mean weird impolite welcome paper in the room when you arrive saying that most things in the room are for sale and mentioning that if something is missing when you leave you will be charged for it better check everything is there when you arrive airco makes the air extra extra dry dry throats when you wake up
