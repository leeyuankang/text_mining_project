it was noisy especially having a room above the bar and being woken up early every morning by garbage collection trucks the continental breakfast was average and measly for the included breakfast deal the added breakfast prices were exorbitant euro for a boiled egg really and that didn t include toast surely some fresh fruit and yogurt could be part of the continental breakfast each time i ordered room service the coffee was cold even though i asked for it to be extra hot the room service meals and menu left alot to be desired very unexpected in italy i could not believe they would have frozen lasagne on the menu the wifi connection was very slow and kept dropping out so it was extremely difficult to do any work i was charged euro to iron a couple of garments as i was told that it was too dangerous to supply an iron to the room when the website stated that it had an iron and ironing board available the room was very dark being all black and for a so called eco hotel i was surprised at the number of lights and light switches that were in each room and being so dark the lights needed to be left on during the day the double bed consisted of two single beds pushed together one being a different height to the other very annoying in the middle of the night when you roll over one side of the bed was very comfortable though the hairdryer in the bathroom was useless i had to actually book into a salon to have my hair washed and dried there was no shampoo or conditioner either and the products supplied were very drying on the skin all in all i was very much looking forward to my stay and was bitterly disappointed
