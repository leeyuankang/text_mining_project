the way my credit card was debited during my stay times without any notification before checking out again my credit card was debited for the rd time and even after i left the hotel my credit card was debited on the second day when i reach lebanon most probably because they forgot to check the mini bar so honestly as an advise pay cash don t take the breakfast in the hotel go outside it is way more enjoyable extremely poor and stingy breakfast we reserved a suite the water from the shower was brown literally brown we call the reception they said no there is no problem nobody cared to check we left without shower in the evening just a small word from the reception you were right we fixed it honestly will never ever visit this property again
