hot towel and welcome drink while checking in hmmm nice touch in theory but wet hands while filling in arrival paperwork is not great and carrying my welcome drink down stairs to my room was a bit weird too hotels please ask if customer wants to be escorted to room please don t assume regular travellers like me know how the room works and usually don t want to be escorted to the room
