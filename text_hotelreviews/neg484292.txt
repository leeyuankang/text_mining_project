check in took forever like over minutes involving much peering at screens and writing down our passport numbers and credit card details systems down apparently no coffee in rooms air conditioning weedy and only just ok it was on the day we were there we wanted to use the stairs not the lift slow and only one told it was for staff only never got the wi fi to work in our room during our stay reception suggested we leave our room and come down and try reception where it was strong we were trying to re book a cancelled ba flight so wi fi was pretty much essential actually when isn t it essential too expensive
