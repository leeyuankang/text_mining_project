staff staff staff room size v bad smell all over no parking their are so many hotels around this gray one and much nicer i have no idea how they got stars none of the stars criteria met no gym no business center no lobby no view no swimming pool breakfast very poor and very bad staff with rude attitude just an advise to any travelers if you plan visit milano dont take a nonrefoundble room believe me it s worth it to pay more but you will have the chance to chose and those ppl in this ugly gray hotel knew that you have no way out because of our selection of nonrefoundble room i will never ever go back and i don t recommend it to any body again as an advisor of trip adviser site look for so many hotels around the doumo and make sure you book a none gray hotel look for white hotels
