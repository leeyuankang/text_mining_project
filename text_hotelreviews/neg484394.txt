i was staying in a suite segreta and the layout lighting and amenities had a few question marks for me to start with there was no kettle or anything to have a cup of tea coffee which i find strange for a suite even though there was a sink a tap and even an oven all disfunctional and hidden under a sort of table top in the living room second the lighting was extremely complex to figure out the light switches on the wall in the living room were all not working and lamps needed to be switched off individually not a huge problem really especially considering that this hotel occupies part of old building in the center of milan but what really bothered us is that the bathroom is separated from the bedroom by a semi transparent sliding partition so that not only sound insulation is non existent but also the light in the bathroom immediately and completely illuminates the entire bedroom which in the middel of the night could really be a nuisance if you are travelling with a family
