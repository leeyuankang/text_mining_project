i guess the one thing that made me wonder is the price of the rooms they are nice but not what you could call five star the linens are a bit cheap and things are missing like somewhere to hang your towel the breakfasts were nice but after three nights were a bit repetitive we really enjoyed our experience but i would most probably look for somewhere cheaper next time
