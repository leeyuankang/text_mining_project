almost impossible to find drove around and actually past it for at least half an hour the tiniest of signs is by the front door no parking available had to drive to a parking garage about half mile away and walk back got lost again next morning we did not receive our wake up call and missed our tour to see the last supper our main reason for staying in milan the receptionist was able to get us a ticket the next day so we were able to see it then but that delayed our departure and limited what we could do that day
