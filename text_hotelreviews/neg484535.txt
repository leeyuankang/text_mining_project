we were on the floor top and unfortunately our air conditioner struggled to get the room temperature down to a comfortable level lighting in the bathroom was poor especially if you were applying make up the foam mattress was past it s best as it had a large dip in it on one side the carpet in the elevator needs replacing sooner than later as it did not look that clean and seemed to have a bad odour to it
