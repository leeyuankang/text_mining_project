hotel and surrounds not quite as glanerous in the real very expensive for what you get and they have the cheek to charge each for continental breakfast hot food extra also very noisy at night bar at end of laneway and bin recycling trucks right under your balcony very early in morning again a big negative not allowing guests to iron own clothes fire risk although every other country we have visited this is standard room facilities
