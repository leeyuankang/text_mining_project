photos and information on booking com website did not match the room assigned and this even if the staff said the contrary the bedroom window overlooked the lift we had to ask for another room a suite because all other rooms overlook the elevator for which there was a charge of euro per night around in the morning we were awakened by loud noises garbage trucks works the behavior of the staff was only apparently polite h tel not recommended post scriptum i would like to thank booking com for giving me the opportunity of this post scriptum this refers to the reaction of the hotel to my negative comment i never said as affirmed in the above mentioned reaction that suites are regular rooms for us politicians in fact i am not a politician most probably the hotel confused me with another client regards
