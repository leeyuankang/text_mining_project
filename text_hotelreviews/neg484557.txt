our room was right next to the elevator i could hear it going up and down with people chatting all night i didn t sleep in addition there is an automatic fluorescent light in the bathroom that can not be turned off so the bathroom door must be kept closed since any tiny bit of movement will turn the light on even rolling over in your bed turns this obnoxious light on
