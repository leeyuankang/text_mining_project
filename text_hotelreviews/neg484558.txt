location of bathroom switch is difficult to find behind the door there is also a sensor that turns it on automatically but it also turns it off in the middle of the shower so make sure you pay attention to the instructions on where the switch is at check in staff is very friendly but not receptive to positive suggestions for improvement such as better location for the bathroom switch or a written sign they also seem obsessed with pushing you into putting in a good review and can make you miss your train listening to suggestions would help much more for a good review rather than arguing why they think they are right but overall a great place and i will go back for sure
