my girlfriend and i had requested a twin bed and the hotel confirmed we were getting one before we arrived once there they gave us a room with a queed bed and a little bed in the hall at the entrance of the room the bed was clearly designed for a couple traveling with a child when lying on the bed are legs did not fit in the bed we complained to the manager and the owner and both insisted we got what we had requested we found out from another employee that in fact they had rooms with twin beds but ours was given to someone else the owner was rude and not accepting of their error the rooms are expensive and you would expect a better approach with dealing with customer dissatisfaction
