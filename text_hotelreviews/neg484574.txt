it didn t bother us but if somebody wants a nice view from their room beware that our room nr was facing the small but nicely arranged courtyard the air conditioner is placed at the bottom instead in the upper half of the room as it was very hot degrees celsius it didn t cool down suffiently also whenever you leave the room the electricity is cut off and so is the air conditioner the room though stayed cool
