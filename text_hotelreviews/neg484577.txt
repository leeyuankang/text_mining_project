the hotel is in a bit of a construction area temporary no doubt but that should not deter anyone a short walk in any direction easily allows exploring of the city the only thing i thought could be improved was to replenish the coffee capsules each day the second day there was no coffee in the room in the morning very minor change can fix that with no problem
