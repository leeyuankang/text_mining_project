when we first checked in we were taken to our room and it was described as being small and not very comfortable it also had an internal window so was claustrophobic but if we paid euros more we could upgrade to a suite i felt pressured into doing this and thought this was a bit cheeky in the suite you had to pay for water and coffee so it was all a bit of a rip off the restaurant did not have any atmosphere and the service was very slow
