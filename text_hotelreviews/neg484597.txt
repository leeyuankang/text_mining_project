don t bother with the buffet breakfast which was a waste of the additional euros per person the bread was obviously left over from the day before as was a chocolate tart and some cookies all stale a lot of pre packaged items a few cereals two small plates one with a few slices of ham the other a few slices of cheese on the buffet table the coffee was weak and lukewarm eggs could be ordered but we skipped them for fear of what they might be like they should check to see the abundant and fresh foods that other hotels are offering for buffet breakfasts either included in the price of the room or for a lot less than euros we opted for it as a time saving convenience on our last day we wanted to leave the breakfast room when we saw it but felt uncomfortable doing so you ll do much better at any local cafe
