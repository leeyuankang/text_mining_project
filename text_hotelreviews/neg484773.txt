the pictures of the suite that were shown on booking com were misleading and we got in some kind of misunderstandings with the staff on the picture it was looking like i got the presidential suite but when i arrived i was given an executive one the staff explained that they do not advertise the presidential suite on booking com therefore they are not available and it was impossible to get one on this website it took me an hour to verify all this information beware of the pictures
