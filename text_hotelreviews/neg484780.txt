the free wifi is a joke during salone del mobile every hotel hikes their rates into the stratosphere i was paying and the wifi was not even secure and you had to log in every day it kept kicking me off so i was incurring data charges when i thought i was on wifi you had to pay another for secure wifi i left and came to a lovely guesthouse in central rome where the wifi is free and secure this is what i expect at every hotel in this day and age
