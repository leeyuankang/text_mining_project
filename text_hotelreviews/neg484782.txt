we were put in the first floor overlooking a main road so we couldn t have our curtains open because cars were so close got very little sleep all night because of the traffic right outside our window and emergency service sirens it was so loud it sounded like the windows were open there was also no iron in the room water was an additional cost and there were no plug sockets near any mirrors no english tv channels breakfast was very average not a great experience for the price paid could ve had much better elsewhere for less they also make out the hotel is much more central than it actually is definitely couldn t have stayed for more than night
