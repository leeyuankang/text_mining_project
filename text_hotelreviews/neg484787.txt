for the price paid for two suites for days i found ir ridiculous to have to pay extra money in breakfast for fried eggs and waffles we spend in th erooms and then euros for a fried egg it s not what i expect for a star hotel and for suite customers also free internet was not good so also had to pay eur for a decent wifi again alls those extra costs should be included in the room price disappointed
