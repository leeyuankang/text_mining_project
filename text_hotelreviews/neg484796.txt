for those who are seeking an early dinner after a very long day of sight seeing etc e g the options are limited as the hotel restaurant only serves dinner from room service is an option at per person on top of the actual cost of the meal which is not exactly cheap there weren t many options for food around the vicinity of the hotel with many restaurants cafes closed and there were also some which were not worth paying for this resulted in a good walk to find a decent restaurant to eat at which was quite disappointing
