i wouldn t recommend that hotel to anyone who likes classy and respectful service the first night we arrived we were expecting a bathtub as pictured in the booking photos except when we arrived it was a shower so we complained they told us we had to wait until the next day but to check out at and come back a so at first it was ok but still we were left without room the next day my girlfriend was taking a bath when they suddenly called us complaining about water coming down from the floor we were understanding but nothing came from us they kept pushing us to leave the room and made us hurried up we weren t feeling comfortable at all and finally the breakfast was nice but not amazing the location neither
