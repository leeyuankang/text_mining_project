the room where we sleep was in front of the street we could heard all the cars crossing any time of the day the breakfast was good but everyday was the same one nothing changed on the days the bath had green and black lines with mold from till is the breakfast the restaurant was over us and we can heard the chairs moving when the people stand up this with the cars can guarantee that you not sleep anymore after the lid of the toilette was broken on one side so every time you seat down it moves complete to one side so at the end you was in the ceramic again
