i forgot my gold jewellery in the safe in the hotel room and contacted the hotel as soon as i got back fortunately the hotel had found them and agreed to send it to us by express mail if we pay for the charges which we happily did when the jewelries arrived we were shocked to discover all gold pieces were missing and the other jewelries were sent to us we informed the hotel but neither the hotel nor the courier mbe and ups takes responsibility for the missing pieces and tell us off by pointing at each other although a nice hotel we are deeply disappointed in our experience with this hotel and would never go back not recommended
