our room looked out onto the santa sofia and was very very noisy to the point of actually not being able to sleep it sounded like the windows were opened although they were not also we ended up having a dinner at the hotel one night would not recommend it at all no atmosphere no ambience empty tables and the food wasn t great either oh what a waste
