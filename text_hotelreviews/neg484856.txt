i was quite disappointed they had a service for tea and coffee but then supplied styrofoam cups and plastic spoon which dissolved virtually in the hot water also there is a fridge but there could have been milk or uht milk supplied instead of powdered milk my thinking is they should modify this arrangement as it is called palace everything else lived up to this except for this and i was so looking forward to a cup of tea also i could not see any maps of milan available this would have been helpful
