very dissappointed experience specifically with the services provided by the hotel and reservations team even i was a loyal customer the reservations team charged me twice for a room and didn t informed on my arrival that under my name there was a second booking reservation therefore i wasn t only charged but also they didn t provided me with the second room the personelle over the phone was very unhelpful and was unprofessionally blaming me for the error without acknowledging that the reception falled to provide me with the second room i don t believe that this attitude is aligned with any star hotel
