unfortunately we had a bad experience with restaurant staff that evening who were arguing with each other also kitchen staff chef coming looking in on restaurant and staring at us several times restaurant very cold and poor choices very uncomfortable situation however after feedback with gabriel restaurant supvr he apologised and put into place some service recovery by offering us drinks in bar and left word with reception staff next morning to apologise again they offered small gift as part of apology shame about all this as hotel very comfortable but they need to review staff performance and somehow give restaurant a lift to encourage more people to use perhaps not in a convenient floor for guests to use hope this feedback helps manager to improve facilities and address staff issues
