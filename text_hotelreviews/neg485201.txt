i had to put comfort at very good instead of excellent for two reasons a very small room for two which may be due to the building and b the absence of room service for hot dishes we have an early supper and had to search for the salad elsewhere also the cost of parking at the garage away from the hotel euro per day seems a bit high compared to the room rates euro but these are really minor compared to overall experience
