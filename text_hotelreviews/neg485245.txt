the room was small and had no where to put our bags so had to put the two big chairs for a sitting room type of little area in the bathroom and the doorway beds were a little uncomfortable and small every time we left the hotel we had to give back our key to our room which was a bit of a pain as when you came back you had to ask for it again shower was ridiculously small but a dirty floor inside of it
