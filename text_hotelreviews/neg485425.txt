air conditioning cannot be controlled from inside the room and the fan is located right above the bed so the first night we literally froze despite the reception telling us the ac was at degrees celcius ended up switching rooms twice but the other rooms were also extremely cold so we went back to our original room and ended up moving the bed bed sheets were all over the place not happy with those either
