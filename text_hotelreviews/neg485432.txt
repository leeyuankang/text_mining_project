when we where leaving in the morning the doorman did not lift a hand to help us put our luggage in the cab which was not very nice i expected that especially as we had two children and his help would have been appreciate it and he would have received a tip but he just was not interested very bad i hope that the manager of the hotel has a talk with their porters this was very disappointing
