the staff attitude made us feel like we owe them money firstly as we check in and out nobody ever welcomed us or even said thank you usually when you check out the front desk will ask a question about your stay unfortunately even something terrible happened during our stay none of them asked our opinions or apologized at all the second night when i was taking shower the shower sink somehow stopped working due to the weird design of the bathroom there is no door or glass blocking the shower from the rest of the bathroom thus the water came out and flow into the room i told the front desk about what happened and they sent a staff over and he took a ton of hair and wastes out of the shower sink in front of me then he left to get cleansing tools to wipe out the water and without washing his hands he brought us a new set of sheet as the previous ones got wet it seemd like it would take him at least min to get the job done and it s already am i called the front desk to see if we can change to another room shockingly the first reaction of the front desk is why didn t you come out of the shower when you found out it s not working why did you let this happen excuse me is this really the way how four star hotel service people talk to their customers and remember as we checked out the following morning nobody ever said anything about this issue in addition the air conditioning is controlled by the front desk you have to call them to set the temperature to your desired ones and it s locked it seemed like they are not familiar with the operation of the system either it took us times calling to get it right
