the only small criticisms are the breakfast buffet should be more expansive and include more items of food i e more types of fruit in the continental breakfast this is especially in consideration of the price they charge per head room service menu is very limited in the day time as a star leading hotel it should not be limited to cold food only in the day time and hot food should be available hours a day but wasn t it was limited to sandwiches and salads in the day time
