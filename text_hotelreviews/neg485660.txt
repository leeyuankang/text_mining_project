this time the room we got was a bit dirty with big stains on the walls near the bed which did ruin the impression from the otherwise very nicely decorated room also even being on the third floor the noise from outside street was terrible and loud even with the windows fully closed i think that something has to be done with the soundproofing urgently the noise makes it very hard to sleep
