the lighting in the room is so low brilliant to prevent glare but not good for us girls that like to do our make up in natural lighting the restaurant was the only place we could use on our first night as we arrived so late from florence and we were quite far from other places and for a simple salad for people we paid almost euros felt like it was catered to americans did not feel european or italian at all sadly
