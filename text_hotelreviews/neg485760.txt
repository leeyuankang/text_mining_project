first most guests appear only to stay one night when travelling to and from italy therefore there is a constant coming and going of guests from morning till late night as the hotel is quite large this causes some noise and also some waiting time in the morning when trying to have breakfast or to check out in addition we had quite loud neighbours which obviously had to scream and shout from time to time and whose television i could hear plus someone repeatedly made very loud noises down the floor until am until his neighbour obviously had enough and stopped the guy by shouting loudly at him second as already mentioned the hotel is quite large so don t expect a cosy breakfast on the contrary the large breakfast hall was packed with people the quality of the food was less than average we would say there was lots of sweets and cakes but less fresh and healthy stuff also the presentation of the food was not well done third the building appears to be one of three buildings which stand in a kind of park the middle one was well renovated and forms now the hotel the other two buildings flank the hotel left and right those are old unrenovated and decaying buildings of the same height as the hotel which reminded me of old parking houses the buildings have nothing to do with the hotel but are still a very disturbing sight
