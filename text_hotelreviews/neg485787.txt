the parking lot is located behind the hotel on an elevated area we had to carry our luggage up and down on stairs there was a guy from the hotel with and assistance badge but he clearly doesn t wanted to help with our luggage during check out the receptionists where very rude when i asked something she start speaking to her colleague in italian and the guy just looked at us and started laughing other guests who asked for taxi or map also got some comments in italian so they didn t understand the cleaners ignored the do not disturb signs and knocked on our door every morning when i asked them about it they just talked to me in italian they didn t say anything in english at breakfast the full canteen was packed we had to wait about minutes to get a table then another till we get a fork because they ran out another morning the cleaner just came in without knocking it was really rude by the way the hotel staff said the city center is in minutes we can walk there but fortunately i rather got a taxi it took minutes drive till we reach the milan dome and costed like eur i spent the half of the accommodation costs on taxis during our stay
