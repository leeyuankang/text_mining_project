we arrived due to delayed transportation at pm there was no food available by this time and we were directed to the local mcdonald s this turned out to be a dark min walk which ended with a pathway down the side of a motorway the whole thing felt risky especially with an year old in tow the staff were only being helpful and they were very nice in hindsight i think they could have found a space for us to eat within the hotel to eat and allowed us to order food to be delivered they probably don t have the authority to break protocol but in circumstances like ours they should be able to as sending a family out at midnight not knowing really where they are going and not knowing the context they are in seems a big risk the breakfast was also very poor cold rubber fried eggs bleak selection of bread this was also at am when presumably it has been freshly prepared
