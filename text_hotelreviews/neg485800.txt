the overall score of my rating would ve been higher if not for the staff and the things that happened found opened bottles of water that were left in the mini bar this is a clear sign nobody s ever bothered to clean that room before when i told the staff this all they seem to care was to give me another bottle of water but that was not the problem the problem was that if the mini bar was not checked how could i know the room was cleaned in every morning the cleaning staff enters your room at without knocking or anything probably because it is a big hotel they need to clean it so early they pre booked the entire amount from my credit card before my arrival then they asked me to pay when checking out i found myself in the situation in which i double paid the hotel for some time because the first amount blocked was returned after a few days i know the money did not go to them but if you prebook the entire amount in advance from my credit card why do you put me to pay when i leave just take the money out of my credit card if you plan to visit milan every day it can be far away if you just wanna get to milan and then to other places in the north como etc it s great
