booking com gave us a room rate that was very affordable for two rooms for us and our teenagers when we got to the hotel they told us that rate was for two single beds and two people they charged us euros more plus euros city tax per person another euros to get two rooms with double beds this property was also a euro taxi ride from milano centrale train station and a euro taxi ride to milan linate airport where we had to go the next morning all in all it was a nice clean hotel but not the bargain as advertised on booking com
