there were no pancakes at very crowded noisy breakfast despite the delicious looking picture bed was large superior double room but mattress was very hard bathroom was clean looking but smelly seaweed sewage and ants kept appearing no matter how many i squished on the floor there was nowhere to hang any towels up to dry except a hook inside the shower elevator arrival bells were much too loud we could hear them from our room at the end of the hall furthest away from the elevators from all the floors wake up at night for whatever reason good luck getting back to sleep with the bells going off every two minutes
