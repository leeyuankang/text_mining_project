however the breakfast buffet is awful the worst one we encountered in italy the most heartbreaking thing is the coffee comes from a machine although its busy operations they could at least make fresh coffee for all guests but the worst part for us was housekeeping on the first morning of our stay the housekeeper walked right into our room without even knocking and me and my partner were naked it was very embarassing then later they proceeded to tell us we left our door ajar which is very bad as if anything is stolen the housekeepers will be blamed very unprofessional but the last straw was on the second morning at housekeeping starting knocking on our door we just wanted to sleep as have a long haul flight ahead and around another housekeeper just barged into our room this time no apology i work in the hotel industry and i can say this property has big issues with housekeeping also had to request times and wait until we received an iron very disappointing
