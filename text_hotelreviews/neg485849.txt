it s just such a bad location there are no restaurants close by and the only place to get food from was a mc donald s and a petrol station and they were a good to min walk away the euro room service charge seemed very expensive to me also don t be excited by the extensive food menu in your room as when we called up none of it was actually on offer or available to us
