even its written that pets are allowed you cant take your pet to breakfast room or restaurant you will be forced to leave your pet in the car which is impossible when its degrees outside or you will need to leave the dog in the room alone which will end up with damaged furniture the first night we arrived late and there was no soap shower gel etc next day we found some the price is reasonable breakfast was a bit chaos because of too many people not enough place not enough waiters for such amount of guests food or drinks are finishing so fast and waiters are not able to replace new ones or clean the empty tables
