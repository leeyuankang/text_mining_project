location its a residential area away kms away from train station area is desolated with hardly any people moving around so it can get challenging to come at night it s gets a little scary staff that s not a typical staff you would expect if you book by booking com their behaviour was similar to hotel staff like we ve booked a hotel with least interest in their guests absolutely no interest in guests not even percent of interest in showing a smile or asking how can we guide you around milan which places you can visit etc definitely we never got this similar behaviour in other bookings if we were to book simple hotels we never came to booking com it was as if we were dealing with professional people paid to check in the customers say thank you and bye bye poor experience
