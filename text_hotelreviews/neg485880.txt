i was placed in a disabled room and felt uncomfortable about it i tried the dinner buffet one night it was horrible not enough selection of hot food and other dishes like the salads were not fresh the meat was undercooked especially the chicken a bad representation of italian food it lacked creativity not a star hotel not enough facilities like a gym or pool no porter service no hour room service
