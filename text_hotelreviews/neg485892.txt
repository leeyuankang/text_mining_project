i don t think breakfast lived up to some of the reviews i had read and also i looked up what was on offer for breakfast on the hotel website and things where listed that weren t even out and we got down in good time before service ended i don t think the breakfast room is big enough as this is obviously a very busy hotel and we found it difficult to find a table and when we did we had to wait minutes for it to be cleaned and set up with cutlery the food was only average none of the pastries were freshly baked and with the large amount of people the food quickly went down leaving not much choice
