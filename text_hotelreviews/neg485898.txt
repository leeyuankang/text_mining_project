not a big thing should have pre requested but still i specifically asked for a kettle at the reception as there isn t one inside room the receptionist said that they would bring a kettle to me shortly i waited for an hour nobody came then went down speaking to the receptionist again i was told all kettles had been lent out they only told me after i went down speaking to them again and i was quite frustrating with the inconveniences caused by not having a kettle
