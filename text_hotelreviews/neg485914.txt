we only ate breakfast one day our last day we had to take the train to the central station and we did not had time to sit and eat i told my kid to get a piece of bread to take with him but the fat bodyguard that stands by the door stopped my kid and told him to get inside to eat i told him that it was a piece of bread and we had to catch the train we paid for the breakfast but we are not allowed to take anything but i can sit there and waste as much food as long it s inside the room was also dirty blankets were stain with some fluids the mattress was also dirty with all kinds of crap and it looks like they never sweep the room i did not like that it was far from milan and the train does not run often it s also located next to two abandon building we walked to the mcdonalds and it does not feel safe around that area
