day i noticed that the hotel didnt actually offer shampoo asked the front desk and they were not very useful as i guess the hotel just doeant have any my rooms safe was also broken from day day i had noticed a few things dodnt get cleaned at all in the room day on my third night i went to sleep early for my early train out of town and ended up waking up to some sort of dance party in the room next door at i called the front desk around and then minutes later someone knocked on the door and the party moved down the hall only far enough to quiet down for me to go to sleep i could still hear them from down the hall but was beyond my concern at that point upon checkout the hotel staff asked about my stay and were apathetuc to my complaints
