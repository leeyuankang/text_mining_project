even if the hotel is new it is not clean there is dust on the floor and specially in the corners dirty badcover with someones hair which stuck inside such basic things do not allow you to feel comfortable from the first minute in the room warm air conditioning was not working at our stay it was around outside no heating in the bathroom no way to dry your clothing or even your towel just one small hanger so to sum up we stayed there just one night and could live with it but were looking forward to check out we would not recommend this hotel
