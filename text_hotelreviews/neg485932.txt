the hotel is situated in a quite unfriendly area and as it s a huge hotel there are crowds of guests in the hotel especially during c i or c o or breakfast which can be really uncomfortable but these are things which are not possible to change so we had a lovely time at your hotel thank s for the great service and just everything
