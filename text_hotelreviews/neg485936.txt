while in principle the hotel should be accessible due to its proximity to the train station which is almost literally just behind it it is far from everything in fact it feels sad that the neighborhood has nothing to offer no bars no restaurants just one tiny coffee shop which is barely open and a bleak abandoned building next door it doesn t do well to one s spirits best to go to this hotel if you have a car otherwise you will be spending so much time commuting to this location
