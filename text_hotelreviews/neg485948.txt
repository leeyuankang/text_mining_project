try to add couple of staff to manage peak hours from property to metro they could arrange a shuttle will add added value as in midnight we need to wald an area totally dark and there is no safe this is serious issue and we were very much scade while walking its take almost minutes also we came to know there is public bus service available if we could instructed by property management in order to stop one before the metro station as there is no bus stop the one near also my personal advice to such a beautiful property do shuttle service from metro x keep public transport ticket so they can issue to utilize by guest break fast food is not tasty the can do better
