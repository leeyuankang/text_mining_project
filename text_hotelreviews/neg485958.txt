location very strange part of town surrounded by two large abandoned buildings on either side of hotel when i say abandoned it looked like squatters would live there quite scary looking on first impression in the evening bed pillows bed was extremely hard and pillows were worse had a hard time sleeping bathroom for hand towels it was paper made to look like cloth breakfast was a churn burn school cafeteria style it was a large hotel and eating off site was not an option unless you took a rather long walk off campus would not return to this location
