no tea making facilities in room breakfast at certain times in the dining room is chaotic and on one day i found it stressful trying to find a free table to eat at other days was fine it is also a good minute journey to get into town for sightseeing although the nearby parks are cute there s also no nearby restaurants or shops for bits and pieces
