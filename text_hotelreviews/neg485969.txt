we was supposed to have a suite for adults but what we received it was a king bed and a smal sofa bed that two of us should sleep on it it was narrow and very uncomfortable all over the room even in bathrooms was lots of ants moving we was afraid to have them on our bed the guy on reception told its like this because we are beside a park two huge ruin buildings was adjacent to the hotel building cause us feels like we are living in ruins of world war
