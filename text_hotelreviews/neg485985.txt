we booked this hotel based on an offer of which said that the original price of the room was close to euro per night this was far from true and i do not understand how booking com can allow this kind of lies on its website we knew that the hotel is away from milan however it is also under re construction quite a lot of noise throughout the day with not the best materials or service on top we were put in a room for people with disabilities so overall this was not a euro per night hotel or room and thus not what we signed up for as we could have found another hotel at the center of milan for the same price
