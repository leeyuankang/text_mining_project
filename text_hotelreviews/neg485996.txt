the hotel was far from downtown milan in addition the pictures do not align with how this hotel actually looks it s really old and though it may be renovated shortcuts were taken as an example the bathroom s tiles are broken and rusty mirrors were cracked paint is peeling all over and the balconies are far from romantic horrible views and also rusty it s really a dump in an abandoned area i wouldn t stay here for free
