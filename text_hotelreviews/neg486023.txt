coffee machines at breakfast the first day we arrived at and all three machines had been turned off we were brought coffee from the machine in the bar by staff when we actually got to try the coffee the next day it was horrible italians make the best coffee in the world so what happened another criticism was the cold breakfast buffet cold eggs bacon and sausages you need trays of hot water or heated plates underneath the food staff a blonde lady with short cropped hair told us when we first arrived that there was nowhere to eat close to the hotel apart from mcdonalds turn right out of the hotel and follow road down to pedestrian bridge a min walk to find cafes bars and a carrefour express in comasina which is the closest metro stop
