it took over an hour to check in because of an outgoing function one girl told us to wait at the side and she would call us over personally then unbeknowns to us she went home and we had to line up again the room smelled of smoke so we had to have the windows open even though it is the middle of winter we were next to the elevator which has a bell that rings near constantly ask to have a room away from the elevator the walls and windows are thin so you can hear everything that is going on finally there are some roosters somewhere closeby that start up at and pretty much don t stop all night and they sound like they are being strangled like actual screaming
