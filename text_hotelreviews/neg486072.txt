we have been in this hotel two years ago we came again because we didnt know it will be so dissapointing air conditioner heat in the room was bad the sheets were badly filthy there was a problem with the window even that it was closed cold air went inside the room the most dissapointing thing was the breakfast as we remembered a big veraity if food we barely ate something no vegetables at all and more sugary things than food defenitely not worth the cost even if its quite low
