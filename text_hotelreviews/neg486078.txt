small area for breakfast we had to wait in the line everyday there could be some more supplies for example there was only shower gel and no shampoo in the end we had to pay more than we expected because there were taxes that were not included in the final price of booking com although mentioned at another point of course booking com could be responsible for this and it s our fault we missed the reference to the additional taxes but i prefer to know the final cost right away when i make the reservation
