they didn t want to serve us breakfast at even though breakfast time was until according to the hotel policy because they run out of food surely this might happen but the way they handled the situation was a total shame we were told that they provided us at the check in with a paper showing the correct breakfast time which wasn t obviously true after that they started changing all papers showing that breakfast is until with a new one showing that breakfast for that specific day was until it seemed unreal moreover they told us it was our fault that we didn t read correctly the breakfast time from the paper we never received after a long arguing with the hotel manager who said that we shouldn t be complaining because the breakfast is offered by the hotel and not included in the room rate which is the most ridiculous excuse i have ever heard we were only offered a minimal breakfast at the hotel bar for which we had to fight for hours overall we have been treated very badly and felt like unwanted and stupid guests the level of ignorance was too damn high p s the bathroom was disgusting with a rusted shower hose and a clogged sink
