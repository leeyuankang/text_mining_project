breakfast was an extreme disappointment lines to wait every day dirty and very basic poor quality food the hotel is situated between two deserted buildings and is in a terrible location to city with rail station only intermittent stops walls are extremely thin and you can hear everything in adjoining rooms and to top of off there are roosters to wake you at what the i would never consider returning to sum up here you really get what you pay for
