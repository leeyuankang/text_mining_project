we had the worst check in experience ever we had a small problem with our credit card that was going to be resolved later that day by our bank fernanda the hotel receptionist not only did not helped at all but she was rude to us by all means made us feel uncomfortable and bad threatened us that she was going to cancel our booking due to an invalid credit card finally of course we gave another credit card this was not a problem for us but honestly we have never felt so uncomfortable and undesirable upon check in to a hotel all the other members of the staff were really great though very helpful and kind p s fernanda when you see a backpacker checking in to star hotel it doesn t mean that he she doesn t have any money to pay for the hotel so treat all the guests equally and not with an attitude of rudeness with an extra sence of irony
