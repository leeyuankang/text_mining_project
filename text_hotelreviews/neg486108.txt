the name of the hotel is not visible from the main road they need to make a name sign as well at the side of the hotel so that clients may identify the hotel when they come to look for it from the main road especially after going over the bridge moreover the hotel s entrance from the main road is one way and there was no signage indicating way to the hotel and we ended going round in circles through a number of one ways when we arrived at the hotel to make matters worse when we arrived at the hotel with the car we were informed that we need to go out and find the parking of the hotel at the back since they do not provide access to parking from the hotel from the security guard area again the way to the parking in the dark was very difficult to find since there was only one sign but the way involved going round again through one way lanes pls do make frequent signs to indicate way to hotel and to parking since it took us mins going round to find the entrance to hotel and parking
