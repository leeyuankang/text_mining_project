the location is quiet disappointing better to go with the car the hotel is in between the abandoned buildings that also almost equal of the height of the hotel the staff never answered my call when i m already in my room the sink and the bathtub are blocked when you do your booking online you still have to remind them what you have written in your booking quiet unprofessional
