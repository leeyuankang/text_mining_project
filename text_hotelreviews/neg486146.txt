the breakfast was cold and no big variety was available one of the staff was extremely rude the coffee is never hot barely lukewarm and the food is not worth the money we booked two nights and one extra night separately on booking com but we forgot to book the day on between the two bookings so we extended our stay the receptionist said we d have to pay the same rate we assumed the same rate as the one from booking com and they made us always pay in advance we paid but on checkout we were told we d only paid for the extra not and that we still need to have to pay for the booking com booking the employee was completely and utterly rude to us and told us it was our fault for not double checking after her colleague i highly recommend taking extreme caution when booking here
