the stuff was terribly bad not helpful at all they had a rude attitude hardly smiling and make you feel like you oblige them to do their job many of them did not even speak english expecting by us to understand italian all the prices were very expensive eg beer euros buffet for dinner euros not including drinks never made us feel that we were in a friendly environment not even close there were not the necessary facilities that could justify a star hotel there was a lot of space both in the rooms and in the common areas however almost empty only some plastic chairs and tables the bar was very very small with a very poor outlook barman terribly rude as well i would never suggest this place and definitely this was not a star hotel
