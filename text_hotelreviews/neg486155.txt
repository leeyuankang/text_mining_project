we arrived early to request a room a day earlier than planned additional nights stay this was confirmed as being ok as was the rate that we already received we were advised the room was not ready and to come back at no problem when we did the room had not been booked different satff member when they finally found a room for us the rate was not as previously advised the staff lady who we booked to room when asked seemed completely oblivious to the discussion we had previously had basically she did nothing in respect to making the discussed booking poor customer service and a waist of our time
