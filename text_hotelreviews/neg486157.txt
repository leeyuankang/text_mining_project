there was major building work going on right outside the front of the hotel realise that this is obviously essential but the drilling went on from until during our entire stay luckily we were out most of the day but did come back a couple of times in the afternoon evening and this was very disruptive the air con did not work and given the noise from the building work this meant that we could not open the windows and the room was therefore very stuffy the hotel also has cockerels roaming the grounds and they are very noisy from about onwards constant screeching the noise issues building work and cockerels was the major factor in not providing a higher rating there were actually a lot of positives about the hotel and would return again once the work has been completed would also take ear plugs in future
