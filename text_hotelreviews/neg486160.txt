it could have been cleaner but overall it is a good hotel close to the highway with great food however it was badly indicated we didn t see any signs then we saw a partly hidden p for parking which in smaller letters had the hotel name on it the hotel is located in a residential apartment style area near other buldings that seem like they are for business
