hotel is big so naturally the rooms are a c was not working properly although we were sent to a room with two separate beds they corrected their mistakes carefully but they did not give us larger rooms which was available and because of their mistakes we were expecting so hotel location is not so nice for people without cars even impossible for them to go to the bus station by walk especially when they try to turn back to the hotel at night it is not so safe
