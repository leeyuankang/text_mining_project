the bar area was trendy plastic chairs in leonardo da vinci hotel was out of place the area does not give you the impression of four star but a budget hotel transport facility was incredibly bad for an overseas guest there should be a minibus between the metro comasina and the hotel at frequent intervals say half hour for that reason i would not recommend for anyone of my age there was no business facility i would not stay there on future business trips
