on the first day we arrived the property at only to be told that we had to wait up till to check in i was gutted because we had made reservation and were told on booking com that our booking was confirmed this was after very long flight hours and it was our first time in milan we had to sit in the lobby and wait not cool another point is that we requested to be checked in to a room on the upper floor but that didnt seem to make any meaning as our room was the very first on the first floor
