terrible view of abandoned buildings in various stages of decay left right looked like nobody wanted to pay to have the old hotel demolished and removed noisy the walls are paper thin and a flock of roosters in the front yard started their annoying crowing before daylight and never let up thermostat couldn t find one ended up turning the system off no hooks or bars anywhere for the towels really only one inside the shower no restroom shower vent switch makes for a steamy and or stinky lifestyle
