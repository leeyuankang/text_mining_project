i was highly disappointed by the location of this hotel it was not good choice secondly i booked one room with two adults my child of age years but they charged me extra amount per night for my child the staff was very rude at that time i will not recommend this hotel to anyone one more thing you should bring your drinking water with you while staying in this hotel
