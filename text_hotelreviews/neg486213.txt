it started off a little weird at the check in as the receptionist kept addressing me while asking for my girfriends passport origin even though she was standing right next to me the keycard system didn t work seems to happen quite often but that wasn t a big deal heading to the room we were wondering if vacuuming the corridor to the rooms isn t a thing there were even some cardboard leftovers laying around sadly the maintenance of the room decoration doesn t seem to have the highest priority many of the decoration mirrors were shattered the bathroom was clean but when we arrived there was no soap shower gel or shampoo provided but a shower cap this and the shower floor didn t make a star impression the next day there were sanitary items so it seemed they forgot breakfast well to be honest i was a bit shocked when we entered the breakfast room on the first morning the typical all inclusive tourist mentality it s free so who cares if i eat it left mountains of untouched food on the tables this is not the hotels fault so you can t blame them that much probably a tribute to the cheap price in that battlefield it was hard to find a table that was both clean and had cutlery the hotel also has a restaurant we were planning to go there after coming back from the city it turned out to be an all you can eat buffet that night but the restaurant was just occupied by a family with three screaming kids and one guy wearing headphones while having plates in front of him not what we expected in a star hotel but since we were just minutes before closing time and out of other options nearby we were asking for la carte menu or snacks offered for roomservice too with an extra fee of the waiter who was really friendly told us that they have snacks and pizza at the bar upstairs the bar was another highlight of customer service
