no fitness no spa compared to a bnb hotel the breakfast is good but compared to a star average otel it is normal breakfast nothing continental or great about it rooms are not soundproofed i can hear average to loud talking from both walls of my room although i hanged the do not disturb sign on my door my room was entered and cleaned after warning the reception about this and having them take a note and promise that it will not happen again it did happen again the next day my room was again entered and made up what kind of approach to privacy and customer request is this what is the problem i will talk to the manager on my checkout if this time what they said is true not recommending this hotel to anyone last but not least it specifically states soundproofing on booking com and fitness here on google but both of them don t exist breakfast is regular for me not continental as stated on booking wifi is provided but slow and unstable
