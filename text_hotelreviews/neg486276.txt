as far as i could aknowledge from my experiente the clients that have booked through booking are given room less prepared efficient than the rest we were given the room and when i took a shower no longer than to long since we were going to dinner i had a swimming pool water all over the bathroom and already going to the room i ve called the reception and they immediatly told me that they would send maintenance and at the same time without me asking told me that the hotel was full i ve received myself the maintenance and explain what happened as if i was representing my own home the maintenance guys were very kind and told me that the repair would take to long to handle i ve called the reception saying that my husband needed to have a bath so that we could leave for dinner already around the lady in the reception told me again that the hotel was full i ve answered that i had nothing to do with that i just neeeded a resolution s magic happened and a room appeared free on the floor when i ve entered the new room i ve understood that the new room had the amenities that anyone expects in a stars hotel like the soap and shampoo sily things but that make part of any stars hotel experiente so i had the impression that booking com clients are diferentiated had the impression that they were expecting that i would not complain about the malfonction of the room bathroom i was not very happy i dos not notice any advantage in being a genius hotel
