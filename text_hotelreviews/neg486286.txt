not so soundproof rooms from door side breakfast can be a mess due to huge amount of guests avoid after as you wont find seating in the main room and might wait for having food of your liking if you are vegetarian as fruits and veggies are limited eggs scrambled are more than enough with all sausages and bacon cakes etc fresh fruits limited healthy alternatives also limited if vegan vegetarian check if anything changed but dont expect much staff are assisting but limited in the breakfast time and can be frustrating to both them and guests
