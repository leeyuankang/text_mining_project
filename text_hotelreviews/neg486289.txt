location is a bit too far out and surrounded by derelict apartment blocks long queue for check in bar prices a little expensive and not sure how this happened but somebody had access to our room while we were asleep at the door opened and somebody entered the room we did inform the staff the next day who apologised a nice hotel that has a lot of potential but doesn t use it
