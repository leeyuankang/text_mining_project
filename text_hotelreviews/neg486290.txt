the breakfast had alot of variety but tasted unproffesionaly awful it was very crowded and we always had difficulty in finding a table since it was an all you can eat buffet the food and the crowded place had a very bad smell due to the congestion of people the location was very hard to find it was between buildings and the entrance was extremely hard to find the picture taken as the front of the building is not what you will see in real life so don t depend on the picture the front is covered with buildings and trees the rooms had no facilities what so ever not even a coffee maker the elevator took forever to reach any floor we were on the where we eventually took the stairs to go down and painfully waited for the elevator to go up their pillows were almost non existant i hated them
