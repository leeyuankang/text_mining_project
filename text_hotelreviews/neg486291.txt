i didn t like that many guests are waisting food at breakfast dear guests please only take the food that you are planning to eat do not take slices of bread and sausages if you are only going to eat of each i know breakfast is included but that s no excuse for taking food that you re not going to eat it s too crowded at breakfast we have to wait till there is a table free the hotel is not ecological minded there is no need to change the towels every day there are no facilities in the bathroom to hang up our towels we hung up the towels in the closet but they are still changed children were playing in the hallway very late after midnight and in the morning our neighbors put on their music on very loud with their doors open the hotel should inform the guests that they should mind the other guests at all other hotels in italy we only have to pay the hotel room after checking out at this hotel we either have to pay the whole bill at checking in or they will pre authorize my credit card i chose for pre authorization of my card now they ve made a reservation of euro on my card and they have not cancelled that yet
