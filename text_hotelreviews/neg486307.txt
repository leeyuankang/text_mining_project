loooong queue at check in an impression of hidden dirt hotel looks more like a student rez in the dirty corridors there was a smell of cooking a bad smell rather then appetising smelly mattress and pillows musty soundproofing between rooms nonexistent as we had to listen to the couple next door copulating which for a family with young children was unacceptable my kids were asking me why was the man beating the woman and she was shouting you could also hear kids running up and down the corridors till midnight as the doors were also inadequate breakfast was as if in a pigsty everything was unhealthy and artificial juices cakes rotten fruit the hotel is set in a area with abandoned buildings railway lines and the view from the window was onto a construction site the neighbourhood was littered and dirty and far from anything and everything the entrance to the hotel from the parking lot is down steep stairs and no assistance to help with luggage or ramp it was funny to watch people struggling up these stairs with their luggage it is a joke that this hotel has stars someone should investigate it if you think that i must be exaggerating then spend a night there and
