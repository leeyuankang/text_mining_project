the elevators are small slow and always crowded beds are a little stiff but did not bother us much beware the nearest metro comasina is mins walk away that gets you to centre of milan but there is a train station though near but we never bothered going that way as we enjoyed the daily walk room service is costly other food options are like min walk away ie on the other side of the comasina metro station they hold euro temporary block on your credit upon check in even though the room is paid for but none of the above bothered us much
