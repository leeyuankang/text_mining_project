even though we had booked the room months in advance and made it clear that we would be travelling with a small baby we were put in a room next to the elevators and i assume all the mechanical parts as this was the top floor and they were really loud with all four of them travelling mostly throughout the night i don t quite get how this room and perhaps the other ones close to elevators have the right to exist at all in a stars hotel the lady on the reception only agreed to move us next day so this was a night of a bad sleep resulting in a headache when we came to the reception desk next morning the ladies there were chatting between themselves as if the queue in front of them did not exist at all they agreed to change our room but in a quite unpleasant manner of doing you a greatest favour imaginable we were moved to a quieter room so the rest was mostly ok to make it clear i do understand that this is a mostly conference and business travel fouced hotel but we once stayed in a simillar place on the outskirts of barcelona and it was perfect whereas da vinci leaves much to be desired and from the standpoint of a business traveller i would hate the idea of trying to fall asleep in a room filled with elevator noises even more there are also construction works going outside and finding the hotel may be quite an issue
