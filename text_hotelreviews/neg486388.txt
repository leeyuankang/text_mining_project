we booked a double room it was confirmed we would have an extra large double bed when we got to the room we had two single beds the reception staff wouldn t do anything about it and would not let us speak to management we had the buffet at the hotel for dinner the food was cold and very bland not at all worth the we each had to pay for it for the whole night there was a fan blowing very loudly right above the room so it was not easy to sleep the breakfast the following morning was terrible it was mostly processed food again very bland there was no fresh fruit juice the only options were orange squash water or coffee the reception staff in the morning would still not allow us to speak to management about our appalling stay and instead said we would receive an email i have still hears nothing from the hotel not even an apology and i expect that j probably never will due to the fact not one member of staff showed any interest in either us as guests or the mistakes they had made
