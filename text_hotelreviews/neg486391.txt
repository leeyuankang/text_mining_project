the worst experience staying in hotel ever not hotel staff is very rude the receptionist gave me the right room only form third time with the rude reply that he don t see the point in my complains the area is very bad metro is min by walking no shops no atm nothing there very hard to find a hotel there are no signs on the street in the rooms there are no kettle so you are not able to enjoy tea or coffee in your room only buy in the bar the bath tap was broken so it took ages to fill the bath instead of duvet cover they give just a sheet i know it is italian way but in my opinion it is not hygienic in the check in you must give euro deposit and city tax is euro per night but all this is nothing in comparison with crowing roosters outside it was not possible to sleep it is insane to have this animals in hotel territory i could not believe it was happening the hotel was noisy by itself bad noise isolation do not recommend it could be a good hotel probably with another management
