the only negative point nothing to do with the staying itself was about the bar me and boyfriend went downstairs to get a couple of drinks and the bartender practically ignored us and a couple of girls that were waiting because another guy asked some beers and served them first before all us waiting obviously this doesn t change the good experience at all
