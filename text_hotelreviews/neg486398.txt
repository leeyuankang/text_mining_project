the only downsides to the hotel are its location situated a minute walk or minute bus ride away from comasina metro station on the very end of the yellow line the nearest shop is also a bus ride away and for some unknown reason to the front left and right of the hotel and actually sharing the same grounds are two very badly derelict old hotels kinda makes you remember seeing war torn sarajevo on the news in the the i m not sure why they are there but they ve both been completely stripped back to the concrete but it looks like there are no current plans to demolish them the only grumble we had was with the barman the drinks are very pricey not his fault but he was rather rude and a little disinterested to serve us and although clearly we were stood waiting he went to serve people who had walked up to the bar that second he was also rude to several other customers and walked off to serve other people whilst they were trying to order food
