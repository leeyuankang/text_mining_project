i wondered why this hotel was so cheap i guess it was because it is located in the middle of what seems like the ghetto of milan lots of out of business building and graffiti on every single standing structure there was a man in the gates parking lot of the hotel who was peering into people s cars we told the staff and they said they d send security out but refused to hear a description of the guy the guy left and they didn t get to talk to him we went downtown and came back around sunset the man was back this time in different clothes and an umbrella cause it was raining he was again stalking the parking lot our room had a view of the parking lot we told the staff he was back they refused to call security or even talk to him to see if he was a guest of the hotel i guess they didn t care that he was touching and looking into the hotel guest cars the staff was rude and said is this a problem for you i said yes it is but they still did nothing he stayed out there till we got tired of checking and fell asleep
