i didn t like that we were told to pay local tax charges on arrival at no point was this made clear in addition there was no kettle and cups in hotel room and we were not told that we would be charged for taking anything in the little fridge even though we didn t use any most star star hotels have them as complimentary so i think it s important to tell visitors what they will and won t be charged for
