more drawers in the room bed coverings can be cleaner when we booked it was written no need payment but the day when we returned to hotel our key didnt work when we asked why they said you havent paid for we found this explanation is stupid because till that time no one warned or informed us about it although we had paid for the next day evening our key didnt work again this time they said we dont know why this point should be improved if you dont stay in the room during day time it is ok but if you have to stay you should know there is construction in front garden side
