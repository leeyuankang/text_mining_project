reception not really overwhelmingly friendly need to be basis only generally staff not very fluent in at least english sometimes hard to communicate and skilled service dinner buffet all hot things were cold throw away plastic cups for the juice at breakfast and the same cups in the bathroom are you serious what an environmental sin the hotel itself was very cold no good heating plus windows open at c the room has had an aircon that cools in summer and only heats in winter unfortunately it was already on summer mode and could not be changed no alternate heating available mobile heater really not nice with a months old child at night and this year s april temperatures location of the hotel was far far away from anything plus quite awful in the middle of a rather gloomy residential area of milano would i recommend this hotel no there must be better hotels at comparable rates
