we didn t like the fact that they asked us for a credit card as a guarantee for the extra charges or the damage that we may cause in the room in case that someone didn t have a credit card they had to give euros that they would take back in the check out i think that they should inform us earlier about the this and not during the check in anyway take your credit card with you and you will be fine another problem was the location which was ok in case you were travelling by car but public transport doesn t reach the hotel so we had to walk minutes from the last metro station to get there in our case we didn t mind walking overall the hotel was totally worth it
