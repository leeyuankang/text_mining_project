the hotel is minute walking distance from a metro station which will seem far after a day of visiting when you are exhausted the area is far away from the city so if you want to get something to eat at night good luck you will not feel you are in milan but somewhere near milan from where you commute daily the rooms were very noisy the windows were very badly soundproof so it was the same if they were open or closed same for the entrance door i always heard everything that happened on the hallway loud and clear plus my room was next to the elevator great the thing that bothered me the most is that they blocked euros from my card when i got there and now two days after i got back the money is still blocked unacceptable another horrible thing was the temperature it was very cold and the heating didn t work the temperature we set on the thermostat made no difference on the actual room temperature we kind of froze a little thank god it was spring also i don t get it how they are rated stars they have no facilities at all no pool gym etc i would not stay here again nor recommend anyone to do so people if you want to get a real feel of milan stay at the hotel in the city not in the countryside you ll want to get a shower after a day of walking around and then go get dinner better take a three star hotel in the heart of the city if you re budget conscientious than davinci you ll spend more money on night taxis otherwise anyway
