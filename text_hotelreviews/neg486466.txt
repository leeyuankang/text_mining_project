the breakfast area it s huge and full of people because its a big hotel and unless you want kids to scream all around you dogs to shake their fur in your food yes they allow animals to come in and people to knock you off when you have the food in your hands there s no way you can have a peaceful breakfast there the food is not that diverse anyways same old stuff everyday the bar is really expensive you would imagine they would have smaller prices since you already pay for your stay but in some cases its more expensive than downtown
