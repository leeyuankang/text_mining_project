i have paid premium price as its a busy week in milan and i had a good start with an upgrade the room had a plumbing issue that led to bad smell in the room the quality is not the best but it is new staff have an opportunity to improve how to deal with requests i asked if i could extend the stay for another night and were told the hotel were complete then a few notes and low voices passed between the lady behind the counter and i presume her boss and she came back with yes you can stay for euros per night i think there normal rates are euro to euros so a huge increase for an average hotel they would have been better off saying there were no rooms rather than insult me or as they say in italy preso per il culo its a no show next time
