we arrived so tired and so late and when we asked the receptionist to have a fast check in he shauted and he was speaking with us in so bad mode after registering our passports we surprised that we are overbooked and there is someone took our rooms so bad staff and there is no any kind of respect for the guest i don t recommend this hotel
