the restaurant is in a remote location however it is a short walk approx minutes to the closest metro station the staff were not very helpful however there is a computer in the reception to help you get around milan be aware of the air conditioning there are only two settings on and off and the hotel decides whether it is hot or cold so you may need to use the natural air outside to cool down as the hotel is very hot
