i didn t like so much the reception my sister needed a baby bed and we ask for one before we booked but after we camed they told us they didn t had a baby bed anymore and she still had to pay for it and the biggest problem for me was the way employes talk to you a litle bit arrogant we were claiming the baby bed the other employes were constantly talking in italian between them while we were claiming our rights and i didn t like it so much
