the hotel located far from the main road and it s in a one way street so you should follow the signs for the hotel however there was not clear big signs to direct you in to the hotel besides the parking located behind the hotel so you will do this procedure twice clean the rooms without prior notification there was not so many things in the room as the hotel is star like free drinkable water slipper tea coffee hotel has a buffet dinner with reasonable price however it was full of sea food chicken and meat plus salad and desert but we expected italian food from italian hotel there were too much people in breakfast area which show that the breakfast area is too small compare ti the number of rooms in hotel but the the personnel tried their best to provide the guest the best service
