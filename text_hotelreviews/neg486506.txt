very strange place this is not something you would expect from a star hotel the room was really big but with dirty bed covers and not clean floor the dishes used for breakfast were also not sufficiently clean including the lipstick stain on the cup not sure about the location perhaps it s convenient if you have some business meetings in the area otherwise it s far from the city center you get what you pay for
