the night staff were helpful polite but during the day the staff all seemed to have an attitude the cleaner was plain rude although she could not communicate with us she knocked and told us to leave the room signalling with arm gestures that she wanted to clean it i asked her to leave it as it was my birthday i wanted to chill i said i was happy for her to just change the towels she scowled at us moaning in italian then had the cheek to give us dirty looks throughout the rest of our stay there was also a mix up by the hotel with the rooms i booked resulting in us paying a late checkout fee of for the hour we tried to complain but were told there was no manager needs a overhaul in customer service don t eat here if you can help it catering needs an overhaul most of the food is cold very disappointed it s a lovely looking hotel im not sure if i would suggest this hotel its nowhere near the heart of it and it s sandwiched between derelict buildings this i wouldn t mind if the staff appeared to care about your concerns or were the least bit helpful know some italian as you can feel talked about rather than to when communicating with staff beware airport shuttle is expensive as are the taxis use the rail to bruzzano
