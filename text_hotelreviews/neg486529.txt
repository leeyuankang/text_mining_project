there are some roosters in the area which are crowing non stop practically impossible to get a good night rest the hotel room is very cold but the hallways are hot it is in a very isolated area if you arrive past the restaurant will be closed and there is nothing nearby if you are planning to take a cab to the airport good luck cost me but was told by the hotel attendant that they have a fixed fee of the taxi driver pretended of not speaking english the price per night is reasonable but at the end cost a way more unless opt for commute with the metro and shuttle buses
