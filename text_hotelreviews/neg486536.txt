breakfast was overcrowded hard to find a table to sit down and understaffed lot of tables were not getting clean on time for new guests to sit down good variety and quantity but the quality of the food is a bit bellow average for italy the first room we stayed in was too big and was lacking furniture which made it look sad and not so cosy good looking as in the photographs it had also not been clean properly had dust over the furniture stains in the blanket intense cigarette smell from previous guests however reception was happy to change us to another room hotel looks very modern but rather minimalistic and empty should have more furniture to make it more cosy after all it s a hotel and it s all about making guests feel like at home lacks coffee utensils in the room also no extra pillows or blankets those need to be asked for
