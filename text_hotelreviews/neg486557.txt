the metro station was away from the hotel and when you arrive at the metro station there is no transportation to get to the hotel you have to walk all the way with the luggage if you arrive at night it s horrifying it would have been great if the hotel had a bus shuttle service there is a restaurant but it was never open it would be nice if there was a shop in the hotel selling souvenirs sweets snacks water etc the house keeping always kept bringing us three towels instead of four even though i told them every day that two of us had to share the same towel the breakfast was big but always the same things
