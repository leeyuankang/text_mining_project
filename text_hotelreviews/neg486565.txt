we enjoyed our stay untill we went out one day and returned to find that all our shampoo soap toothpaste and toothbrushes and a few other things had been taken from our room nobody in the hotel seemed to know where they had gone and didnt seem to be bothered or prepared to do anything about it due to its location we were unable to just go to a shop and buy more we have been all over the world to many hotels and have never had anything taken from our room
