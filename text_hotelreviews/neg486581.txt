we had booked a room for peuple and asked via booking for an extra bed it said on site that they were available in hotel when we arrived at the hotel we were told that it was not possible to have an extra bed the hotel admitted that they should have informed us and the only solution was to pay for nights for a second room more than the cost of our room for we therefore had to find another hotel a bit cheaper and sleep apart as we couldn t cancel our room the deco in the hotel is cheap looking and it is in an undesirable suburb of milan from our window we had a view of a derelict building
