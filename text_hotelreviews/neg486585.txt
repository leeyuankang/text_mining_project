it didn t seem as a star hotel no slippers or bathrobe no lotion or hair conditioner only shampoo soap no shower curtains the water gets easily on bathroom floor which is not heated there was weird switch in the shower which does nothing and has a rope hanging from it no tea pot in the room no shoe polish no minibar or room service price list the hotel is between two unfinished buildings there are no shops or any place to eat near i wouldn t recommend booking this hotel for the full price if you are expecting hotel but if you get good deal it is ok
