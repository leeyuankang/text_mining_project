when we left the hotel my girlfriend broke her arm we left via the main entrance and she used the slope next to the stairs because she was having a roller case with her the marble like floor was so slippery that she fell and broke her arm the security person that we passed when we left only understood italian so we could not communicate the issue e g to prevent other people from experiencing a similar fall another issue from a completely different nature was that the shower head in the bathroom was spraying a lot of water towards the ceiling instead of to the floor which resulted in a completely wet ceiling and cold water dripping from the ceiling
