guests are not allowed to drive into the hotel driveway in front of the main gate but rather instructed to drive to the main parking in the back of the hotel where they have to carry their own luggage down and up a couple of flights of stairs before they reach the elevator in all fairness a member of the staff offered to carry the luggage up those stairs while checking out hotel address in the website does not correspond with the parking address therefore guests will have to make a detour across one way streets to find the parking on their second try we had a bed related malfunction as the headstand dismounted from its holder but luckily we escaped unharmed
