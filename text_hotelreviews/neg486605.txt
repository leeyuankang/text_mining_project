the location was terrible stops on the train outside of milan but also literally a rose between two thorns as the two building next door were derelict the train station is literally next door so that is convenient but the last train back is before so restricts what you can do at night a taxi into the centre or milan expo is nearly e no facilities for such a big hotel for a star hotel you would expect at least a swimming pool
