awesome experience in a hotel which supposedly has stars horrible welcome at the reception hotel is so big it s likely to be overcrowded elevator and breakfast area the location is also horrible right next to the train station and surrounded by abandoned houses on both sides also the roads are new ant the gps does not know the right way to this horrible purple castle rooms are big but seem to be partially furnished there is no information about minibar prices or other important info about the hotel there is no shower curtain so the whole bathroom will be flooded after shower and on top of that there will be some roosters singing you a happy morning song around in the morning
