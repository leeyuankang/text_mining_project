we ate in the restaurant and whist the food was ok the service was dreadful we only ate a main course as no one came near to see if we wanted anything else and we had to find a waiter to get the bill the head waiter was very nice when i felt unwell but the rest of the staff were totally unorganised we asked for an extra pillow and had to wait nights and only got one when my husband went to reception only to be told by the girl on the desk that he was a liar and it had been delivered
