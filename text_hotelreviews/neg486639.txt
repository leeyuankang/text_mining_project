the location in the middle of nowhere the train station is noisy when a train stops can t have it all the sound isolation could hear people talking from the parking into my room on the floor with the windows closed as well as my pillow shaking each time my neighbour would close his door the coffee is good enough to put you off from it and no indications for the parking lot so you head for the main entrance and end up going round the horrible concrete towers surrounding the hotel to end in a spooky parking lot overall it s a cheap and badly finished hotel it reminded me a old soviet hotel from the from outside
