i arrived just after mid night and i was put in a noisy room where i could barely sleep due to the sound of machinery working it seemed to be the central air conditioning or electrical power generator there was a leak under the lavatory and the toilet was not the type i was expecting it may be ok for disable people but for me and the children it was not good at all because the floor was all wet when someone had a bath i asked to be changed and they couldn t offer another room promptly but they did it next day the second room had a far better toilet but it was still noisy and again as i just realized it around am in the morning when the machinery become really louder i also couldn t sleep well on the second night it seemed to me that the staff didn t care about my claim i was so frustrated that i decided to move to other hotel when i asked to talk to the manager the receptionist told me the manager was not available but i noticed she was receiving instructions from someone she was consulting in the office i felt really bad treated that i wanted to leave the hotel as soon as i could my advice to other customers based on my experience avoid the first floor rooms i cannot speak about the rooms on other floors but make sure you check that you can cope with the machinery noise that can be really louder during the night and also i have some reserves about the managing team they didn t show any effort to understand and solve my problem another problem the room telephones didn t work
