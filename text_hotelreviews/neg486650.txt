more at home in las vegas or atlantic city than in an uninspiring milan suburb you can t miss it it s big and a subtle shade of purple just off the motorway in a non descript housing estate the hotel feels more theme park than business stopover or quiet getaway the impressive entrance and grounds are largely wasted as the car park is at the back check in is painfully slow and there seemed a permanent queue just like vegas without the gambling to keep you amused while you wait no desk in the room nowhere to hang towels in the bathroom reception areas are funky and minimal with no comfortable seating quiet areas or business center the dining room is more like a vast neon cafeteria than a sedate dining experience the logistics of running a large hotel fail miserably insufficient reception staff elevators parking and breakfast space are reminiscent of disney on a bank holiday weekend than a well run hotel
