this stay was a nightmare i had booked rooms and we arrived at one of the rooms was occupied with sleeping people i was exhausted after driving for hours and didn t have a room to sleep in they threw a twin mattress on the floor of one of our other rooms and we had to fit people into a room that was reserved for only we were refunded for the room that had people in it but not for the room that i slept on the floor the staff was rude i asked to speak to the manager and was not given the name contact information or appointment time i could come back to talk to the manager after paying thousands of dollars to come to europe this was not the experience i was looking for i am extremely disappointed with my experience at this hotel
