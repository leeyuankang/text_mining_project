the breakfast room was overcrowded and staff overwhelmed one day people had to wait to get a table there were no cups for coffee left and some of the food ran out and it took long time until it was replenished not a good way to start your day second day was a bit better but if you want a quiet breakfast you better go somewhere else despite having lifts there was usually a queue they seemed to be slow operating maybe one or two was out of order used the staircase manytimes
