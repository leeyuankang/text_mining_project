towel rails missing the drive way to the hotel is closed and most people carry their luggage down the stairs into the hotel the breakfast has a good selection but the way it is organised is not efficient the staff in the dinner restaurant is completely incompetent and disorganised the tables get not cleared efficiently after customers leave hence no tables are ready for new customers the food was ok by staff had a long time to take orders and needed to be reminded to bring bread salt pepper cheese
