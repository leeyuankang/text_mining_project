both the interior and exterior design are terrible this place should hire an architect to improve it the bed was pretty hard breakfast was nice but as there were a lot of guests eating at the same time it was complicated to find the table they ran out of some meals every minutes coffee from the machine was pretty bad the food quality in the restaurant was very poor and overpriced
