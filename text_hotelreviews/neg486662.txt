breakfast on the sunday was chaotic as the hotel was fully booked was informed there were about guests so we ended up with no table so a long time there was no system would have been nice if someone was controlling the guests flow rather than for us to fight for a table the following day was much better as the hotel was not so full anymore will still need some sort of system nevertheless the walk to the metro station was a bit of a trek for my mum who has trouble walking would be nice if the hotel offers free shuttle to metro for the guests the lift none existent basically as it never stops on our floor so we always ended up taking the stairs even with all our luggage don t know if they were working as there was no indication on where it is etc
