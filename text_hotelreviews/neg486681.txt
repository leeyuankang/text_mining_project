we were in this hotel for nights from july till to visit milan and choose this hotel because on booking com was discount and close to expo first my impression was that staff in check in desk couldn t organize check in fast there were lot of people and worked answered on phones and so on only girls so we waited prox min to make check in for big stars hotel its incredible long after check in came to room and the room was so dirtily like in motel we lived in high floor room especially bath we asked to clean and walk away to visit milan came late night the room was still dirty we fought probably they will clean at morning but it didn t happen dirty was not only in room in breakfast room too and staff were rude i give to this hotel stars maximum and probably this hotel should check some sanitary inspection because such dirtiness could infect someone its not safety to stay in this hotel p s when we check out i asked about some book where could i write about it or call head manager to leave complaint but guy on reception ignore my request
