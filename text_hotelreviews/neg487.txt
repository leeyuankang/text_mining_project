definitely not a star hotel triple room was super tiny not even a double room size we were really struggling not enough wardrobe space not enough plugs in the room third bed very umcomfortable facilities very basic toileteries including only shampoo and shower gel very bad quality not even shower cap or body lotion except for the reception ladies staff very rude definitely not reccomended being in london in the same area several times and there are definitely better real stars
