overall state of maintenance is appalling the bar serves drinks at five star plus level prices with an ambiance of a three star product the breakfast service was so slow that even though i was the only person in the place after i had only had one espresso the rest of the order had not shown up i just left for my meeting and got no apologies afterwards when showing back up at the reception which sits right next to the restaurant
