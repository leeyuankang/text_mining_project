our initial room had minor flaws we were offered to move after the first night which we accepted the new room was better except it didn t have a bathtub furthermore the house keeping hadn t stocked a supply of essentials such as toilet paper washing cloths etc the breakfast wasn t that great the bread is generally a bit boring in italy and so it was here but the fruit and yoghurt was delicious
