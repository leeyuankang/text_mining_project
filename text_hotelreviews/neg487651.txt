for the star rating of this property the cleanliness and housekeeping was very disappointing our shower filled up and flooded the bathroom and on removing the shower drain cap i cannot begin to describe what we found gross it had never been cleaned the water never got hot and the bath took ages to fill the bath wasn t cleaned while we there the facecloths weren t replaced the floor was dirty the sugar wasnt replaced on the coffee tray and when we requested a porter for our luggage he never materialized when we asked again they said they weren t asked by reception to collect the bags the pavarotti in house restaurant was disappointing service slack endive salad had no endives when i asked why it was an endive salad the waiter said he would check with the kitchen rest of the food was nice but ruined by slow inattentive service most of our choices were unavailable when we checked out we asked to speak with the manager she was out of town but the owner was available we requested to speak to her as we were so disappointed with the whole experience it was an anniversary treat and were then told she was in a meeting and too busy to talk to us the front house duty man told us so many times that it was a historical location and everything we complained about was blamed on that
