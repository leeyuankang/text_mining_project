despite the fact that all of the staff were courteous and extremely helpful the fact is that the hotel felt as though it had seen better days and is trading on past reputation and its enviable location for an establishment of this rating and in comparison to similar hotels we have stayed in elsewhere the basic requirements were somewhat lacking the room whilst acceptable in size was not what we had thought we had booked had questionable air conditioning and required a fairly extensive makeover some key issues broken toilet seat faulty lighting poor quality of towels and basic house keeping errors which meant that on occasions out of a night stay we had to telephone for missing items both the room and some of the external areas would have benefitted from re painting shabby chic is one thing but some parts of the hotel were just a little too shabby unfortunately when paying in excess euro a night for just accommodation breakfast is euro per person extra there is quite rightly an expectation that the basic hygiene issues are dealt with seamlessly in an effort to ensure the stay is as stress free as possible it is also highly unusual to find that the only complimentary consumable within what purports to be a establishment is one bottle of water per day and even that was missing on the final evening unfortunately we came away feeling somewhat short changed for what should have been a real highlight of our stay in the city dinner in the hotel s ottagono restaurant was unecessarily pretentious and in fairness rather clumsy and slow although the food was very good i have a feeling that again past reputation is being leaned on quite heavily as by optimal time for dining in milan we were the only diners in the restaurant
