the hot water was inconsistent this is a huge deterrent for me during winter time during the same shower the water would turn lukewarm suddenly then it would turn extremely hot again my bathroom looks great but wasn t practical at all there wasn t any towel warmers in the bathroom and no place to hang bath towels this happened to both my kids and our bedrooms overall looks good but very unpractical
