the heater doesn t work at all in the room and couldn t sleep all night from the cold alot of noise of people going up and down the stairs of the roof of the hotel making so much noise and u can hear them fight till morning most likely drunks the room looks so much bigger in pics but reality it s small breakfast is way too poor for a star hotel u can t drive to this hotel due to the worst traffic ever in that area sure will never return to this hotel
