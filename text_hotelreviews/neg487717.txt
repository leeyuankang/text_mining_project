everything except the location service was awful some things were working and somethings werent working eg wifi sockets some worked and some were broken the air conditioner was broken so i had to request a fan to be honest it felt more like a star hotel than star my recommendation is for you not to make the same mistake there are many other hotels around cheaper and better
