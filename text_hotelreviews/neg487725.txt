the entrance of the hotel does not indicate at all that you are entering into a star hotel and their lobby is just too small for a star hotel we were given an upgrade which did not look at all like an upgrade and we were shifted to a partner hotel on the same building which honestly didnt feel like a star hotel it honestly felt like a downgrade after going back home i reallized that they have blocked some amount from my credit card even thought the room was prepaid in full and we havent billed anything to the room during our stay
