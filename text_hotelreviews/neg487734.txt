its a long list from having to take several list to get to my room walk across several floors etc the room was court yard facing and all night the sound of bottles being thrown in to bins kept me awake the phone in the room did not work so ordering anything like the iron or the ironing board or complaining about the such things as the shower being broken the electric plug broken plus the remote control of the tv was a major trip to reception and back even then they forgot to bring the iron and the ironing board in the evening after a long day i attended the bar for a quiet coffee to be disturbed by the chefs shouting and joking profanities at each other in the morning after having paid for breakfast upfront the waiters serving me managed to get the cold bread to me straight away forgot about the tea got my order of fried eggs sunny side up totally wrong etc etc too tiered to complain i checked out of the hotel to be told that i owed euros for the eggs which i refused to pay on the way out i entered the lift with a member of staff who knowing i was going down a floor to the exit kindly pressed the top floors and took me for a nice ride up and down the hotel he was embarrassed after realising what he had done over all stay abysmal staff at reception excellent the rest massive training required attention to detail and so forth not worth the money ps this is a short report of my one night stay
