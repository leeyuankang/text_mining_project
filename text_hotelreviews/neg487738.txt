the room was too small for the bed size the wardrobe opened against the bed the oversized drapes dangerous hanging on the floor around the base of the steps as was the bed linen i tripped a couple of times so had to wrap the drapes up onto the steps not a good look it was a single size room over filled and totally overdecorated having to leave and re enter via an ally with cars parked was not my idea of of a fine hotel no bed side lights for reading one ceiling light on one side none on the other you need a more experienced decorator less is more
