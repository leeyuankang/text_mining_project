we were much surprised of the conditions in the room were really poor the walls were really dirty with a lot of scratches on it there was a renovation going on and all the noise was in our room for a nightly price like this hotel it was very unpleasant i ve sent an email to the hotel before my arrival for reservations to restaurants with no any response and when i arrived and asked if they received my email no one answered so i had to repeat my request there was a coffee machine in our room but no capsules we asked for them but no one brought any for a price as highly as this hotel our stay was not really satisfying won t stay here again
