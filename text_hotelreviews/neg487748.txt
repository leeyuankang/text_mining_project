the roof of our bathroom leaked and dripped all night i reported this in the morning as soon as we got up it was only when we checked out that they said we could have a free breakfast which was too late they refused to give us a discount for the wet through bathroom floor and dripping all night the manageress could not be found anywhere the staircase which we took rather than the very hot glass lift was filthy and looked as though it hadn t been hovered for days i eventually received an email saying they would give us an upgrade if we used them again not good enough for a supposedly hotel
