if a hot breakfast is your thing the eggs bacon were only warm on both days we stayed though we experienced the same issue at another star milan hotel on this trip simply need to use equipment to keep food hot which seemed lacking during our stay about mins walk from central station which we didnt mind other starhotels are nearer the station
