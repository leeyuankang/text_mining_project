the staff especially the girl at the reception was extremely rude not only to us but to other customers too she would let you wait in front of her for min for nothing not giving you explanation and if you would dare to ask a question about check in or anything she would keep rolling her eyes this is not possible luckily the guy carrying the luggage was telling her to be nicer the room is not as in photos the money asked for these rooms is too much they are extremely small and very noisy we checked in a lot later than expected because they had no rooms ready we did a long journey so we went to sleep but another customer with a key entered in our room because the girl at the reception gave them the same room h after we checked in they took my money twice once before arrivale from my credit card and again i had to pay at the end of the staying telling me that the first money i ve paid they will transfer it back so far after one week there is no money in my account i m really curious if they will refund my money for me these hotel shouldn t exist it s no more than stars it s far too expensive for what they provide and they should hire another people or do a proper customer training to them very disappointed shame on you
