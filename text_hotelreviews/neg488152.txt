i have just minor complaints one was that the elevators were extremely small they were just big enough for or people which means you had to wait for the next one to come if someone had their luggage with them since you would not fit in also there was no taparello metal outdoor shutter for the bedroom window it is not necessary when you are on an upper floor but our room overlooked a flat roof which made our room accessible through the window i would have preferred to lower the taparello when we were out of the room for security reasons
