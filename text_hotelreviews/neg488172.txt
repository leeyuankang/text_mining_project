bad smell coming from the bathroom maybe it was only in our room if that is the case better do not give that room or similar rooms to other clients to be fare we could have asked for another room but when you are there only for a weekend it is not the most convenient thing to change rooms would prefer faster cleanliness of the breakfast area e g tables when it is busy breakfast is not kept warm e g scrambled eggs
