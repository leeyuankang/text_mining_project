very dirty bathroom lots of insects the issue was fixed after my complaint but still staff is trained to give you the right answer but definitely is not familiar with hospitality concept warm greeting giving you a smile looking at your eyes when talking to you etc shower cabin is very small i am very petite but even for me it was not comfortable enough and water pressure is so poor that it is almost mission impossible to take a proper shower
