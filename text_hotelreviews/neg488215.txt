we had some bad experience with the staff i had booked superior double room king size bed i notified the hotel about out arrival days before arrival that we will arrive in the middle of the night between a m and that i would like their confirmation that they know about it and that our booked room is booked for sure i got their e mail confirming that the room with the king size bed is waiting for us when we arrive in the night but when we arrived the receptionist said that they don t have that room and they can only give us twin room we tried to explain that i have confirmation etc but nothing to do of course we were tired from travelling and took that room for first night to get some sleep as i am pregnant too the room was super small and actually seemed not cleaned properly as well in the morning i was explained that it does not matter what room i book they will give the available room i was not satisfied because i had paid more to get king size bed room and after talking to different people we were given bigger room with double bed i still don t know whether it was with king size bed or not they did not agree to reduce our fee for staying in smaller twin room either the bigger room was great and clean satisfied with that but still got quite bad experience
