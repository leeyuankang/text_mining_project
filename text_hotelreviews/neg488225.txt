at checkin i was asked if i have a car whether i want a parking for it which i acknowledged and taken at checkout i found out that parking is at a fee which i was not told about at checkin furthermore when a supervisor came to resolve the issue she was very unfriendly just keen on proving that this is somehow my fault i was in a rush to catch my flight so i just paid left
