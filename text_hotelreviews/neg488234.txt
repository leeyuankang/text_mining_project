only one small point i know i checked in late but i needed to eat something as i was starving after a long train journey the receptionist said the restaurant was still open for another minutes so if i ordered quickly i could eat there so that s what i did however when i asked nicely if i could have a quick bite to eat the waitress only very reluctantly agreed to accommodate me and i found her service to be distinctly cold she served me a glass of wine that had obviously gone off it was undrinkable and the food wasn t that great as if it had been thrown together i know it was near the end of service and the staff probably just wanted to go home but even still i wasn t impressed by this sloppy service and wish now i had just eaten on the train instead of wasting my money in the restaurant
