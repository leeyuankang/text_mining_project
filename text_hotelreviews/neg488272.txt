the internet was overpriced and still not fast the staff english skills were poor room service was slow and in fact needed to be reminded to deliver towels temperature and food quality was low at breakfast lift was out of use the whole visit and on the final day i needed to walk down flights of stairs with my luggage and then through an ugly service area to leave the building reception staff were slow and seemed not to care much overall a poor value for money experience
