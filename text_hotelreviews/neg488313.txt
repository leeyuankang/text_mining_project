on arrival the staff had said they had updgraded us to an executive suite as were celebrating our anniversary which we thought was great initially but on enetering the room was basically just a double room definitely the smallest suite i ve ever been in i had paid for a deluxe double room which differs from a normal room in that you have unlimited wifi yet you had to pay extra when looging in if you wanted to stream movies etc so that was an extra cost the wifi itself kept cutting out also in certain parts of the hotel and had to move around in room sometimes to get a signal having paid for ulimited wifi in the price of my room already i felt this was very sneaky on the hotels behalf this was very disappointing especially being charged twice for it its euro a night for the business wifi so i initially paid for nights at but because my partner had looged in too they charged and instead of just removing the duplicate they lied and said that the wifif charge is per person which i ve never heard of in other hotels they advertise as having a gym and spa but its basically just a room on the floor with a tiny sauna and steam room and a few weights and a treadmill and stepper definitely not a spa by any stretch of the imagination if we d have known it was so disappinting we d have chosen the mercure which has a better location and and is cheaper
