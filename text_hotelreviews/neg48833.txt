inadequate human resource management the service level was good in patches good part was that at the checkin they accompanied us to the room on the other hand i had to wait for a long time at front desk to get an additional access card at least minutes and then for conceirge at the time of checkout another minutes so definitely something not to talk about in the end i noticed conceirge focal person came personally to pick the luggage may be staff shortage or poor resource management
