there was a problem with hot water in the bathroom we did not get hot water on the first evening in the shower i made a complaint to the reception desk a bell boy accompanied to me to the room and checked together with me and he told me to let the water run and wait more than minutes with this trick we could get warm enough water to take a shower did not get very hot water though the front desk offered kindly a room change but we chose to stay in the same room as this trick was effective somehow
