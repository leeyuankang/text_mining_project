the room smelled like mold the hotel either doesn t have a ventilation system or the system is too weak to absorb the humidity horrible bed uncomfortable you might as well lie in a ditch the main problem with the room was the ac it s not just a central system with climate control neither is it a regular ac set it s sets blowing air in the direction of each other one was located right in front of the bed the other one behind it so the system blasts cold air in your face the whole night there are no remotes to turn off either of them when called the reception i was advised that it s either on or off both of them milan is way to hot in the summer to sleep with ac off so it brought quite a dilemma to suffocate in the heat or to freeze in the cold also the staff said that all the rooms in the hotel are designed exactly the same so moving to another room wouldn t solve the problem never ever have i seen air conditioning units positioned like that the interior designer must lack basic skills knowledge and the project managers were not even looking at the end result before approving it for the guests to start using the facility i disadvise you from staying at this hotel unless you want to experience everything i had to go through the only positive moment was that i was allowed to check out early due to all the problems without paying for the rest of the nights
