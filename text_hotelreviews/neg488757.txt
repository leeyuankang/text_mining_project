the swimming pool was shut both days due to rain it did not even rain was just cloudy why was it included in the price if we were not even able to use it this was dissapointing the sound outside i guess for the air conditioning or swimming pool was annoying we had to close balcony doors because of the sound we stayed night second morning around am the staff started to cut the grass the sound was terrible so that woke us up and was really annoying as we were on holiday and wanted to relax we have ordered food rooms service and the cessar salad was the most disguisting i have ever had there was dry salad no souce or anything the chicken was raw it was disguisting not had even a single piece out of it it s very dissapointed this is not how the cessar salad is made the breakfast was ok ish the bacon was cold there were no patatoes left at we would come back to hotel just because the rooms are nice tidy but overall did not like the food services staff was not very friendly did not smile and were not that helpfull
