i reserved a suite i assume the most expensive room in the hotel behind my bed there was a housekeeping office the first morning at i was waken up because they were doing a lot of noise when i went for breakfast i told this to the housekeeper and she started arguing saying that it was not her fault that she had to work and that this made noise i went to reception and asked to see the duty manager the receptionist said that he could help me i insisted that i wanted to see the duty manager ha asked why i said that he wanted to complain when i explained him the situation his answer was i need to check because they start working at this means that he doubting of what i was describing i understood that there was nothing else to say the next morning i was waken up at not with so much noise but on a sunday you pay a room to sleep not to be waken up the hotel has huge terraces but not a single chair outside
