we used the spa facilities during our stay and we were not impressed the jacuzzi was cold there were two steam rooms and one wasn t working and the other one was barely warm there were a few experience showers but not much of an experience don t book this hotel if you are after the spa facilities but apart from that it was a comfortable stay
