we did not have nice welcome and seems they still have to learn what service to customers really means it s a shame but it is so that first impression you get is the one you will retain spa half the equipment was not working yes there is big terrasse but no chair no table so you do not really benefit from it just standing there may be in summer they have restaurant we did not find it so good or special we asked pasta instead of potatoes for one dish and the waiter almost had heart attack saying the chef would never accept etc i will not go back nor recommend unfortunately
