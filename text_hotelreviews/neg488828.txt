it s kind of located in a sketchy part of town we stayed here because it was cheaper than staying in the heart of milan and we had a car it s about a minute walk to the nearest metro and then a quick ride into the city the walk to the metro felt a little unsafe but that is possible in any big city also the front desk staff weren t very friendly or helpful
