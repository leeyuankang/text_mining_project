for such a lovely room it was surprising that there was only one chair at the desk table so it wasn t too good for room service also we booked this hotel for the balcony and view as seen in the photos on booking com we were looking forward to ordering a bottle of wine and some food for the night to eat out on the balcony the view however was of the apartments across the road and there was no furniture on the balcony we went into the center of milan to eat instead
