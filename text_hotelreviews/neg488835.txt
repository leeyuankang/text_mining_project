location this hotel is located in a not too great residential area north of the city centre and is a good minute walk to the nearest metro station there s little of note within the immediate area although we did find two restaurants on the main drag via monza to eat at which were ok but nothing special when we first arrived on a saturday afternoon we had to walk for minutes south to find a reasonable street cafe where we could sit and have a beer and a bite
