the hotel staff were completely disorganised took attempts and more than an hour to get checked in there were people on reception including the duty manager only giulia was working while alexander minced about pretending to be on a telephone call and the duty manager sent francesco on his lunch break while he did nothing himself having failed to meet even the most basic standards when i was finally given a key that a had been programmed for the room and b was for the correct kind of room i had booked i asked to see the duty manager only to be told that there was a delay before i could see him because there was a queue so i wasn t the only person experiencing difficulties all these delays meant that i missed the booking i had made to see the english language guided tour of the the last supper which was my whole reason for the stay
