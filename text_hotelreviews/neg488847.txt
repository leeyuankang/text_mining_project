at first we were given a room with connecting door to the next room we could hear almost every word people were talking in the next room asked to change the room and were given a different one it seemed strange that they didn t offer us a normal room from the beginning we went to hotel restaurant at pm asked if the kitchen was still open yes was the answer and we ordered some pasta unfortunately it was heated in microwave or in similar way definitely not a la carte as a result pasta was also overcooked really not worth the money waitress offered us free tiramisu as an excuse if chef is not there don t offer full menu to customers it s disrespectful to serve heated food with a la carte prices
