we had left comments with our booking with concerns about the breakfast buffet my boyfriend is diary intolerant and i myself gluten intolerant we didn t hear back from the hotel and then in the morning when we checked the buffet and there was little for us to eat we were a little disappointed seeing this was such a luxury hotel and other hotels on our trip had been so accommodating
