the hotel is far away from anything they do offer a free shuttle bus but it still doesn t take you into the centre so you have to walk quite a way the staff are a bit stuck up and they were unaware of what a nut allergy was so my boyfriend was unable to eat in the restaurant we also paid for internet so we could watch streaming online but it didn t work and they didn t even offer to try and fix it
