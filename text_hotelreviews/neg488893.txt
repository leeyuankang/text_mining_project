we booked the studio however surprisingly the kitchen did not come with a kettle it had an old coffee pot to boil on the stove however it was all rusty inside and still smelt of someone else s coffee the stove also had a lock on it which meant we were not able to use this either there were permanent food stains on the kitchen counter which i found disgusting the location was terrible as the hotel is literally in the middle of nowhere big balcony however no chairs for us to sit on so the balcony became quite useless
