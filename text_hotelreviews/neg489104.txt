unfortunately the information about the parking facilities at the hotel was ehm misleading to say the least we decided to go there by car as i relied on the information provided by booking com that among the list of the hotel facilities there was parking as well i drove for almost six hours from central europe only to find out upon arrival that there is no hotel parking but some third party parking space around m from the hotel the hotel stuff reacted immediately to my complaint and i received their apologies for the trouble together with a room upgrade on the evening of the second day and when we returned to our room i even found an apologizing letter from the hotel manager and a treat waiting there an email from him was sent as well stating their will to correct the information for me that would be the most important thing to do it is about transparency and trust
