i didnt like the fact that although initially it was writting on booking free cancelation after you booked it you coundnt cancel without paying the full amount also they charger me twice for the room and nobody told me until i called them the money are not back in the account for at least days from the ti e i left the accomodation and nobody apologized for that either poor staff treatment
