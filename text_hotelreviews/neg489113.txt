i reserved two rooms and we were planning to pay seperately the property didn t hold but just draw both of the reservations from my credit card without asking even though my reservations were free cancellation which was a real problem for us the rooms were smaller than the photographs the wifi was poor and to have faster connection you need to pay extra and finally the cleaning lady just threw away one of my personal stuff in short it was a little bit dissapointing
