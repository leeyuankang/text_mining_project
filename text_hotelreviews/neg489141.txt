if you have a problem with the wlan and you try to explain it at the reception they do not pay attention what you say just hand out a paper with general information room the windows do not close properly it was cold in the room because of the bad windows and of course it was not soundproof so i had to sleep with earplugs the hotel was overbooked my colleague did not get her reservation and had to move to an other hotel near by
