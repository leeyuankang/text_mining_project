most of the staff were nice except for one guy working at the reception who was very quick to answer and very abrupt and rude when i told him i asked his colleague to book something for me and later went to check when she wasn t there i told him and he kept cutting me off and saying well i don t see anything he didn t offer to solve my problem at all biggest shock of all for the amount of money we paid the hotel didn t put free water in the room when i asked about it he quickly jumped down my throat and said well that s because it s for the deluxe rooms which i took as a dig meaning well if you could pay for a better room you would have got your water even crappy hotels put water in your room i wouldn t go back to this hotel for the money and supposed stars that they have was not up to par
