hotel obviously had arrangements with restaurants in milan we asked them for recomandations and the places they sent us to did not fit our requests this happened twice during our stay we wanted to dress up and go to some kind of sky bar they sent us to a cheap bistro we thought it was a misunderstanding and tried again the next night they sent us to a slightly better place two doors down from the bistro i mean come on this was not by accident morale look up your own restaurants otherwise friendly and accomodating staff
