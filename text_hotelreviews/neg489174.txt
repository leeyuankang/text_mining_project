the staff were not very friendly and their advice in terms of local facilities was not helpful often it was wrong we ordered food for room service and when this was delivered it was cold and not very appetising the cost for this was sky high and the staff forgot to bring some of what was ordered for what i paid i do not feel i go value for money i have been in much better star hotels that have gyms and pools etc when i booked this i was of the impression breakfast was not included as i do not like to be constricted to one area in actual fact the breakfast was horrible and on our last day we ate somewhere else there was nothing major that made this stay particularly unpleasant but for a city break the atmosphere and general vibe within the hotel was not conjucive to a leisurely break overall staff attitude and knowledge was poor
