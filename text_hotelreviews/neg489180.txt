the hotel staff was very bad and unprofessional which i didn t expect from nh group we got superior room but they gave us the worst room with the view of the place they keep garbage and not even in the same floor and very noisy the woman at reception was so listless and didn t wanna help with anything also the women who stands in front of breakfast hall with the name of paola was so impolite and nerves and baffle in everything that was none of her business so so bad rethink about your choose they don t worth it at all a one or two star hotel will be very very better than this
