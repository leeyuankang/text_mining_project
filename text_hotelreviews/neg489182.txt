we were given upper floor on our request to give us the room with the panoramic view and change the previous room which views durty stairs and roof the new room at the upper floor was uncomfortable although we were arranged to see the room before giving us that room however we would have expected that we were warned that it was mansard actually and during hot daytime it gets very hot it was so hot in the room that air conditioner could not cool the room although we told that we are elderly having high blood pressure in addition we were confused with the so called double room with single use room i payed for this double room but in order to register my husband i was requested to pay additional fee for him if i pay for the double room doesn t that mean one person could be registered for free why additional fee to register him her for the double room which was already payed this was really annoying
