i would recommend more variety at breakfast the choise was pretty poor either the coffee machine or the coffe bun was not good because the cappuccino i tried was the worst considering that it is italy and you can taste the best coffee ever one of the staff a guy members at reception was quite rude we were waiting for quite a time looking for to help us with our bags and he made a look he didn t notice us the hotel is situated quite far away from the city center though close to a metro stop
