the reception staff were ok but we found the bar staff particularly unhelpful and quite rude the hotel maids start really early in the morning and are very loud they did not wait after knocking before walking into the room before we had even made it down to breakfast one morning we had a maid walk into our room three times before we had chance to say we were still in there and ask her to come back later in an online description that we had read it stated there was a roof terrace yet we were told by hotel staff that there wasn t one despite the fact that we could see what looked like a roof terrace from the view from our room the breakfast and location are ok but all in all a very disappointing stay and certainly not value for money some of the two star hotels we stayed in during our trip to italy were better than this one
