advertised free wifi is misleading nh offered two accounts for internet a free but slow too slow for browsing and e mail and a premium for higher speed but at cost of eur per day i found this disappointing as this is not to be expected from a star hotel in and also compared to other same star rated hotels very hot in the room despite a control unit in the room the heating was controlled centrally we had to manage a lower temperature by opening the window one of the two main elevators servicing guest room floors was out of service for multiple days causing long waiting time
