the second time we stayed here the staff on reception desk knew nothing about how to work and what to do spent too much time during check in then at check out they processed the wrong amount and we had to spent min just trying to finalise the bill not enough parking spaces at hotel s parking overall the first time was incredible the second not so much but only because of the staff in a five star hotel although new the people working there should be already very highly trained the service and guest relations should be improved manager luca helped us resolve all the issues but be prepared that young staff will make mistakes
