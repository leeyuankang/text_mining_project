although the hotel is very close to the garibaldi metro station we did not find it a cool place to stay it is an isolated area at night and the metro access in those hours is a bit scary you can feel the smell of urine probably from homeless people who are staying in the outside area personally i did not like the attitude of the receptionist with whom we ve made the check out i don t know his name because they first request an authorization to your credit card the day we checked in my card was refusing another payment in the checkout with the same exact details the receptionist was arrogant and thrown away my card in the desk
