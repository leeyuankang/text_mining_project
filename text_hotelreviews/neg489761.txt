booked what i thought was a triple room with an extra bed but got a double with an extra bed maybe an issue with booking com when i queried this with reception they said they d speak to housekeeping but we then had no further contact until i returned to reception minutes later i think they should have contacted me to let me know the outcome of the discussion staff were unwilling to add a further bed despite there being room for another youngest child ended up sleeping on couch the hotel did provide extra duvet
