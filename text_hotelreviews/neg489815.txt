the room was extremely cold we tried to work the heat in the room but it didn t work but since we didn t stay in the room that much we didn t take the time to talk to the front desk about it the receptionists were ok not very excited about helping very short in answers when questions were asked i m sorry to say but the breakfast was definitely not good i mean for a star hotel the breakfast really was a joke there were no vegetables not a big range of bread the eggs were horrible the bacon was not made properly the girls working there and one guy were very nice though the location of the hotel is a little bit off
