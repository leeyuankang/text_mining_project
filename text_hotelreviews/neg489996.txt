my room was disappointing despite paying for the same room type as my friend for the same period she got a much bigger room with a queen bed separate bath and shower and dressing gown while i got a small double with a shower no bath and no dressing gown the bed was very hard and not comfortable the bathroom was extremely dimly lit so i couldn t see to put on makeup the only other mirrors was on the back of the front door and also dimly lit this was very frustrating the shower flooded all the way through to the bedroom on the first day but to their credit the hotel resolved this matter very quickly the air conditioning drove me insane even when switched off it made the worst throbbing noise which actually woke me up one night and it was torture the only way to stop the noise was to turn the ac on to the highest fan level so i could fall back asleep but in the freezing cold finally the hotel is a minute walk from porta genova the closest underground station in the june heat expect to be baked alive doing this walk it is also at least a min walk toughg navigli i got the impression that it was closer it really isn t taxi situation can be frustrating as they have to be called very few just pass by especially as the hotel is set back from the road during peak times this can take a while
