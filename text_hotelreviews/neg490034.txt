we would stay again i would only ask for another room in room the airconditioning is so positioned that it blows onto the otherwise comfortable bed sadly we were not able to turn off or change the temperature on the aircon and i had arctic winds blowing at me all night it did not give me a comfortable nor restful sleep maybe a few more comfortable seats in the hotel lounge would help too
