unwelcoming staff in the reception and bar i felt like they just try to get rid of me when i was checking in the staff at breakfast was very kind and helpful unfortunately the breakfast it self was not very good selection ok but the quality was poor the facilit is not properly maintained the shower was not pleasant they charge euros for a bottle of bier i normally don t pay attention to the minibar prices but after been charged the same in the bar i had to check why euros for a bottle this is italy not a country with alcohol prohibition finally i believe it was not worth the euros a night
