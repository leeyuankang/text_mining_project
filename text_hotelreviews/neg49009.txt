only the price reminds of a stars hotel nothing else tiny room just a bit larger than the bed dirty glasses and cups with lipstick marks we had to take them back to reception to have them replaced the reaction of the staff was a bit annoyed like why would we bother for such a small issue dirty carpet very dusty very poor lighting certainly to save the planet or the power bill staff generally ok some very nice and proactive some a bit arrogant and totally unhelpful worn out towels almost see through with ripped edges shower over the bath tub spraying the whole bathroom no ventilation in the bathroom scarce supplies we ve stayed two days there was no shampoo we had only a bit of shower gel on the bottom of a container dispenser also marked as shampoo but unusable because of burning the eyes very badly only one milk portion for two guests a tissue box with only one tissue in it we had to go back to reception to ask for a new box nothing like you would expect from a star hotel e g bath coats slippers etc the remote control was very dirty and sticky lucky that we did not need to use it because the tv did not work anyway due to poor antenna or bad link to the antenna we complained they did nothing they only offered a drink at the bar as compensation when we checked out no thanks and no we will not return i m not sure how they got that high average score maybe was just our experience well below average
