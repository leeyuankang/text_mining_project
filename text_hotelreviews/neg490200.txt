i booked a non smoking room however the receptionist gave me a smoking room without notice only after entering the room i realized the mistake but they were full i didn t believe it the availability of pc was fine but the printer wasn t connected the receptionist offered to print my document sent to his email address with a possible lack of confidentiality
