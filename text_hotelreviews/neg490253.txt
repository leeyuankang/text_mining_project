the location of the hotel was far from everything it does say it s only away from the railway station but it s not was much further than that had to take a taxi most of the time to reach milan centrale station in order not to miss our trains but there was a bus station nearby was convenient for getting to the duomo and the room we originally booked was the normal junior suite we arrived late to the hotel and were so tired and just wanted to go straight to bed and the surprise was when we pulled the duvet and found a very large stain in the centre of the bed it was horrifying we upgraded our room the very next day although it would ve been a nice gesture if the hotel had offered to do it for us as a courtesy
