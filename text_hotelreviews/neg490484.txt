very difficult to get downtown there is not metro but needs to make a few changes to go downtown when i arrived i was not asked if i wanted a bath or shower and was assigned a bath which caused that i had to change room staff at breakfast not so friendly the manager lady was not so helpful i had asked for poached eggs and after min when i asked for this i was told the machine did not work no consideration whatsoever for the customer
