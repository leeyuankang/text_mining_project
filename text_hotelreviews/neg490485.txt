again this is a particular beef of mine having travelled for many years staying in high end accommodation around the world for some travellers like myself l choose a particular hotel because of its amenities in this instance l chose the radisson blu which is not ideally located nor close to any great features for the fact it had a pool given the time of year you would think that is one amenity the hotel would have available i was disappointed to learn on arrival that the pool would be closed for the duration of my stay due to maintenance don t get me wrong l am all for maintenance i understand maintenance it needs to be planned and organised to keep everything nice and working well i also believe management of hotels have an obligation to inform guests well in advance at the time of scheduling maintenance that a certain feature won t be available so that guests as is their right can choose to stay somewhere else in my case l would have cancelled my booking and booked elsewhere it goads me that hotels feel it s just ok to put some sign on their counter and apologise for any inconvenience that is simply not good enough even if it can t be helped management could offer a free drink to compensate or a reduced rate given the rate is based on the hotel s amenities it s a bit like ordering a car with heating and finding it doesn t have it because maintenance was being carried out in the heating component area i m sure management at the radisson blu will shrug their shoulders and do nothing as l ve noticed with high end hotels in the past that s cool l ve come to expect that but if l can put people off staying there then l have achieved my objective
