it s very far away from the city center the local bus takes you all the way to the center and close to duomo but it does take a good minutes to get there we were also unfortunate to not be able to use the swimming pool for days of our day stay due to maintenance but we were informed that it was an unforeseen maintenance meaning we couldn t get any of the money back even though that was the selling point
