i loved just about everything about the hotel the only thing i wasn t particularly fond of was that during breakfast minutes prior to the end of the service the wait staff informed us repeatedly that breakfast would be ending shortly this was to imply that my partner and i should leave soon while i understood i expected italian hospitality to be a bit more relaxed seeing as they would be cleaning up the space for at least minutes to hour after the service ends in any case still great food with great selection and a lovely atmosphere
