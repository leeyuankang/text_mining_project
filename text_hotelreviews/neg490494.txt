we just so happened to have a handicap friendly room or else there would have been no stand up shower breakfast was expensive i ended up upgrading my room to include breakfast some of the guests were obnoxiously loud in the hallways we had the do not disturb sign on our door and the front desk called at asking if we want the room clean thus disturbing us anyway the restaurant opens really late for dinner which was a bummer having travelled all day it would have been nice to grab a meal around pm
