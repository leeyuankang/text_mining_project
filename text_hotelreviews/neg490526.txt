i booked a double room with breakfast included when we arrived there they told us that the breakfast buffet wasn t included at the room price and that we had to pay per person per day in order to eat breakfast their heating was not enough so it would take a lot of time to heat the room up but the most important is that we read in the description that the hotel was minutes away from the city center but in reality it was minutes also the pool was not what we expected from the pictures furthermore we were unsatisfied with the hotel bar because it was extremely expensive for example a cup of coffee and a bottle of water costed us we weren t satisfied from this hotel and i would not recommend it for your stay in milan
