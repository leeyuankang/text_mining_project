i chose this hotel for a city break and i was disappointed compared to other hotels at same star level in different countries first at my arrival they asked for my card to block the amount for the staying the actual pay being done at the end at the checkout after some minutes when my bank announced me on my phone on the amount blocked i realised it was euros over the price i had to go back at the reception to find out they charge over the actual price of staying in case you d consume from the room bar i think this is something you need to specify when asking for my card so i don t have to come back and ask for details that s really poor customer service then i realised there were no slippers or bath robe in the room in a hotel that offers pool and sauna for free so i had to go back again and ask about it they sent slippers to my room free of charged but i was informed the bath robe was just for luxuries room so in a stars hotel you need a luxury room to get a bath robe and about the sauna i had to find out on the spot that sauna is actually separated for men and women and they are to be found in the lockers for each gender i could survive that though i find it weird but the steam sauna i used was unclean and on the ceiling you could see very bad dampness to the point i was wondering if that is safe for my health and also nearly to be called a steam sauna as i had to stay for minutes to have a feeling of a steam sauna and now comes the prices which are way than expensive euros for a small bottle of local bear and euros for a breakfast at the end of my staying i had the sensation that this was just an overpriced place with no service for the money attitude i noticed that hotel usual replies to each comment but unfortunately they don t actually acknowledge the feedback nor improves
