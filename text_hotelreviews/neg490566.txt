the staff was too cold or maybe shy the breakfast was very expensive we do not use to eat so much in the morning and we gave up to have it there was nobody at the bar to ask for a cup of coffee and a brioche we do not appreciate the policy of charging a higher price at our check in even if we know that the balance is refunded at our check out i presume it is an usual policy in several hotels
