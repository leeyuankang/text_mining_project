we have booked a queen bed at the check in they have informed us that booking com doesn t guarantee room preference so they have placed us in a tween bed room with my wife so we had to sleep in different beds for two nights also we had two reservations night each because an extra night was a last minute decision they knew it at the check in however forced me to check in the second time the other day very stupid they could have done it automatically luckily they didn t change the room for the second night
