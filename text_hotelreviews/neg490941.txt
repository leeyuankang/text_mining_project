the information about the superior double room the one i booked size was misleading the room was much smaller than claimed sq m when i went to inquire at the reception they said that was the one we booked and offered a bigger room for just euro additionally at the time of my check out the bill along with agreed euro per night was euro higher than the price indicated when booked another annoying thing was a clogged sink in the bathroom and we were not happy returning after a very long day and being very tired to find out that our electronic keys did not work so we had to go back to the lobby and stand in a long line to a single receptionist no apologies were offered for the inconvenience
