unfortunately they use sprays scent marketing in all public areas including reception bar and breakfast area so that i could not stay anywhere near these areas as i am highly allergic to those sprays eyes nose mouth swelling coughing rashes and nausea so i do not recommend this hotel for people who are allergic or asthmatic etc
