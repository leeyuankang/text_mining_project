no hair conditioner among toiletries not once the rest of toiletries were not of the quality to be recommended indeed the towels were not changed on daily basis the shower in the room was not very convenient to get in out and it s very configuration was somewhat tricky the breakfast was poor in selection and definitely not of the highest quality the hotel charged us for the water in the room that was supposed to be complimentary the very process of charging is complicated and puzzling wifi was slow and required registration over and over again
