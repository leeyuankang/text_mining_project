the staff was pleasant and eager to please but a little clueless about the city for example us where is the design museum them we don t know what the design museum is but it must be near the castello because all the museums are there us is there an area with small shops and art galleries them no that would be in other cities they also discouraged us from walking anywhere when in reality things weren t that far when they finally gave us walking directions they were weirdly circuitous
