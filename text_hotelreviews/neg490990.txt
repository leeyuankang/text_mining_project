the restaurant and bar the food at breakfast was poor no hard cheese no jam no marmalade bread was hard im not fussy but a bit of soft bread and cheese is not a lot to ask for as the hotel isnt cheap plenty of lettuce tomato and cake worse was having to chase a waiter to get any coffee or tea as it is not self service and was never offered if youre lucky you may get some at the end of your breakfast the bar staff in the evening ignored us for minutes despite the bar being open and no customers they made eye contact several times but carried on setting up for breakfast eventually we left the hotel and went to a bar around the corner where we had wonderful service
