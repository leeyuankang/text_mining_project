the receptionist called roger was extremely rude and didn t want me to leave the hotel upon check out and i was going to miss my flight coz he didn t have a credit card registered on my brothers room who was still checking out the next day so i told him that my brother isn t leaving and you can take his credit card when he wakes up since it was when i was leaving and he still insisted and called my brother at and woke him up and told him you have to come down right now to give ur credits card and he was so rude to my brother although my brothers room was booked through booking using a credit card for security against any extra charges
