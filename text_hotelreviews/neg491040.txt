i left my handbag in the room after checking out and only realised it after reaching my overseas destination day later contacted the hotel and give detailed information on the bag they said that it was not found even though i have insisted that i am sure it was there not happy at all as it was an expensive handbag and they should have ensured all left items in the room got returned to hotel guests
