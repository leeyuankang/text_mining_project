check in and check out too slow need a separate concierge desk i was in a rush and waited mins to check out as check out counter was occupied with concierge functions and counter was processing checkouts at prime time this was very frustrating and made a good stay a poor experience it wasn t good enough we also had a coffee order in the restaurant forgotten that also isn t good enough
