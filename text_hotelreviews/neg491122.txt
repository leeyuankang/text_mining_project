because the hotel is located near the central train station there are many homeless people and beggars but we weren t worried about walking in this area in the late hours we stayed for nights and the food for breakfast was always the same without changes but all was fresh and tasty for days the towels weren t changed but i m more than sure that if we had asked they would have changed them immediately i m a native russian speaker and speak hebrew fluently but there is not even one tv channel in russian or in hebrew and there are only a few channels in english
