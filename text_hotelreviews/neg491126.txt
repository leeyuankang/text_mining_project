we weren t informed that there would be an additional tourist tax until the moment we were going to pay and they charged us twice on the credit card and made it a really difficult process to get the money back that they owed overall the stay was pretty comfortable but the consequences of their mistakes make us never want to go back there again we requested a king bed but got two separate beds at first had to ask them to change after the first night bathroom lock was faulty though their pastry selection was quite good breakfast buffet turned out to be disappointing esp as vegetarians as the meat and vegetables were presented in the same containers
