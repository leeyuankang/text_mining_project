i wished that booking com could have told us that the hotel was closing on the day of our checkout it was inconvenient that we could not do a late checkout and or leave our luggage at the hotel after checkout as the hotel was closing at noon also the walls in the hotel are very thin and you could hear everything in the hallway however the hotel was pretty quiet when we were there so it was not much of a bother
