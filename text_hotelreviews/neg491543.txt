well first of all when we got there nobody met us to help with all of our luggage and there were stairs immediately in front of the entrance they had a lift for the luggage that we couldn t figure out how to work but even though the staff saw us struggling they offered no help my husband carried the very large bags up the stairs and again nobody went out there to help him once we got to the front desk they did the bare minimum to help us check in no map no suggestions and again no help with our luggage to the room the staff which were about of them just stared at us like we were some oddity very unwelcoming the hotel was not convenient to any of the tourist attractions so definitely not centrally located as described the breakfast was ok the biggest beef we had was that the service was terrible which is a recurring theme of our stay it was virtually impossible to get a waiter to bring us something to drink other than the terrible pre made coffee they were serving we had been traveling for a couple of weeks in europe and without exception all the other hotels served fresh coffee individually at the table americano cappuccino espresso the next morning we were woken up to maintenance work being done right outside our door they had the entire ceiling panel dismantled and in addition to the noise it was very hard to navigate around all the equipment to get to the elevator then we found out our ac was being regulated and our room was set for celsius which is in the s we called for assistance and he came and gave us minutes at a lower temperature we later went to front desk and john told us that it should be at celsius so that there definitely was a problem and when we got back to the room later it was fixed with no further issues john and the handyman was the only helpful staffer we dealt with lastly and maybe the worst when we got home late one night we were locked out of our room
