the staff wasn t that helpfull with recommendations the hotel is located within minutes walk from duomo there s absolutely nothing to do around the hotel very isolated and at night it s not a nice walk a bit scary breakfest was really crowded a lot of noise tons of people and the dining room is just depressing
