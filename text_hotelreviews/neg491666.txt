the first shower leaked the second shower had hair in it and the third shower was an upgrade which we had to pay extra a night for we didn t want to waste our time looking for another hotel so we agreed to the upgrade the receptionist seemed intent on the fact that she had done us a big favour by giving us this room perhaps she forgot that she was charging us for a room that we would not normally have booked if the standard room had been clean enough we asked at check in about the gym and they said it was downstairs we found out later that it was being renovated and the equipment was in pieces so it could not be used we booked the hotel for the gym for health reasons and would not have stayed if we d known this information should be on the website the air con makes noise all night clicking on and off every seconds or so it can t be switched off we asked at reception and were told that it s the same in every room the place is rather strange no sense of luxury despite the high prices a night plus for the upgrade plus for parking the so called junior suite had an exercise bike next to the bed which seemed really odd and the pale colours make the room feel dated although the bathroom is nice and modern breakfast is quite basic with terrible so called american coffee seating outside is limited and cramped and the wicker sofa chairs outside are extremely uncomfortable there is an outside restaurant area but you are not allowed to sit there for breakfast which makes no sense as people usually prefer to sit at a table while eating we checked out early after nights the whole package failed to fulfill our expectations
