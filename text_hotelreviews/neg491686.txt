no facilities to make a drink no tea coffee etc unusual for a hotel not to have these breakfast has lots of good to choose from breakfast staff wasn t impressed with very noisy city we heard sirens every few minutes no where to sit with a few and have a drink and just relax after a day of walking they have a small area down by the bat outside but only walls as views
