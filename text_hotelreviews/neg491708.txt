the location is ok but not so close to the duomo galleria vittorio emanuele ii and other attractions also at night the neighborhood did not seem that safe went out to eat with the family and a couple approached asking for money we kept walking and they threw a can of soda at us which fortunately missed the target yes it can happen in many places but we didn t see any policemen in the area
