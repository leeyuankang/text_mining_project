ok the hotel just opened but there are so many things that are not ok to start with no safety exit details inside the room not acceptable wardrobe s shelve feel off and it s completely dark if the doors are open silly no glasses in the room lights and aircon was faulty shower door doesn t close properly but what was really not ok was the fact that i reported about the shelve to reception i asked to be fixed and just went ignored should have stayed somewhere else the hotel is ok but amateur and not professional service
