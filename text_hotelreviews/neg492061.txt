staff was rude except for one young guy who worked a night shift i arrived late and the guy at the reception a more senior person did not even bother to respond to me in english he kept talking in italian like he wanted to make a point the room was the size of a closet true i booked a room for a single person but still i am amazed they call that a room i went for a conference with bocconi and i had to leave one night early of course they did not want to cancel the last evening although i stayed there already two nights because it was an emergency everything happened too fast on my side and i could not call bookings during that time period to report the issue so they just charged me without any shame the younger nice guy at the checkout told me that the management may respond if i threat them with my bocconi ties but why should one do that and not expect fair treatment other than that i ve seen better rooms in the hotel so just check carefully what you book and do not expect fair treatment
