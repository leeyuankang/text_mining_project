very few staff to provide any support services location seemed dicey parking was around the block at euros a day hotel hassled us repeatedly that our credit card holding the room wasn t good despite the act that we were using it at the same time throughout italy a second card that we were actively using was also rejected finally a third card went through we think that the hotel wanted to cancel our reservation and rent the room at an even higher rate because the soccer finals were in town no other hotel during our day visit to italy had any problem with our cards
