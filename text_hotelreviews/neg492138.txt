there was no hot water in my room and staff were uninterested in resolving this they just shrugged their shoulders and handed us a jug of hot water for washing under pressure my room was changed also there is a bathroom just off the lobby but it has no running water and again a shrug from the staff most unhygenic surely a health and safety matter also items ran out at breakfast food bowls glasses and it was difficult to get these from the staff
