the hotel is terrible they advertise for ac which does not work in the entire building although it was degrees as the owner do not want to run it the room telephones are not even connected not even to call reception the bathroom bath was incredibly dirty i took pictures never seen this in my entire travels overall disgusting they hotel looks like it got stuck in the s and never moved on completely obsolete a disaster never stay there really how can even booking com have this hotel on its list is a big question mark that hotel should not even trade or may be as a hostel
