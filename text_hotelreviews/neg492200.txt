we had two incidents first at the arrival instead of a triple room as requested we received a double room with an extra bed but that cleared quickly as they offered as one double and one single connecting rooms when we left we were charged with bottles of water just because we had some bottles of the same type of water inside the room that were empty unfortunately we were in a hurry so we just paid them after the receptionist told us that this is what is written in their book this is a bit unacceptable for a star hotel the devil is in the details
