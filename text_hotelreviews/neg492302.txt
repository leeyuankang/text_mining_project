we stayed in the same hotel few months earlier as it was a good location for us however now certain aspects changed e g we were told that we cannot be given an iron and the ironing service takes that was a bit of a shock for us specially that the member of staff went to great detail how we should have transported our shirts so they would not get creased etc we would simply expect more understanding and kindness towards business visitors
