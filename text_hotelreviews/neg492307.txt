bathroom was quite old felt like hospital room was dark no proper lightning no carpet in rooms so it s quite cold to stay there no kettle in rooms for tea coffee so you have to order it costs extra through the reception breakfast okay i wouldn t recommend choosing this hotel if you get there without a car no tubes nearby so you end up walking quite a lot
