this hotel can be everything but star it really doesn t meet the standards of a star hotel i would say probably or even star i hope i am mistaken but i had to remove the blanket in order to be able to sleep otherwise i could not sleep because of itching i hope they understand what i mean and do something immediately they ruined the reputation of great raffaello the photos i saw while reservation were far from the room i received and even they charged me more than what it was scheduled the best word to explain this hotel is terrible
