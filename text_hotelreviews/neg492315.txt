it wasn t so much what we didn t like more like personal preference items that weren t there there were no tea coffee making facilities in the room which us brits are used to so that was a slight downer the bed and pillows were very firm and not quite comfortable enough for us personally the location from central milan was good but the road it is on is very busy and quite loud so in the summer you would find it very noisy even at night and would not want to leave the door open for air although i m sure the aircon could combat that issue it was a shame they didn t have an evening menu as it would ve been nice to stay in the hotel to eat if we d been there longer
