unfortunately we do not agree with some of the other reviews we specifically asked for a quiet room and we got the opposite they gave us room number on the first floor unluckily we did not sleep a lot you can hear the metro passing underneath the hotel you can even feel the vibrations it makes an irritating palpitating noise we could also hear every step and sneeze from the upstairs neighbors the breakfast room is too small for the hotel and a bit claustrophobic for us this is a better star definitely not a
