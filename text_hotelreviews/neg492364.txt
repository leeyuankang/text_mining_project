some of the staff are very poor i went down for dinner on wednesday night about minutes before the advertised closing time i was told by a very rude bar maid black hair no name badge that she has other things to do and that if i wanted food then i should have came down earlier she also had the cheek to tell me that in italy it is custom to offer to buy your host her a drink the receptionist appoligised for her saying that she has to leave early however from what i heard from other guests it was common for people to be told by her that she was too busy to serve them how has management not picked up on this perhaps that explains why the restaurant always seemed to be empty the room was below what i would expect for a star hotel the safe wasn t secured just lying in the wardrobe there were a few holes in the curtains and some dead insects flies and ants in the room the cleaner was friendly but seemed rushed off her feat you can get a better quality star hotel closer to the city centre for slightly cheaper which is what i would recommend
