breakfast is a bit pricy compared to what they serve and the place they serve it is very tiny sometimes you have to wait in line there s pret a manger across the hotel with good breakfast items no convenient stores nearby and minibar items are complementary water bottles are served on the first night only so get your water before you go back to the room in the evening
