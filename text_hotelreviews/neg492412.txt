virtually nothing to dislike about the hotel itself if i m being super picky then i will say that the room is a wee bit on the cool side even with the quite noisy a c off and there is very little in the area around the hotel not a shop restaurant or bar in sight so be prepared with snacks and refreshments if you don t wish to pay extortionate mini bar prices eg for a tiny bottle of coke
