we stayed at this hotel for nights and when we started packing to check out on the last day i noticed that money were missing from a closed not see through bag left on the table my first reaction was that this is not possible moreover since for someone to take the money he she must have went through our stuff in the bags this was for me unbelievable my overall impression went so down at that moment even though we were impressed by the hotel room at arrival of course we complained at the reception and of course we knew that we would not see this money again but we were so frustrated i could not believe that these kind of things still happen at the reception they told us that they were also surprised as this kind of things have never happened before however i noticed an older review for the same hotel on tripadvisor when also money were taken from the table in our case the money were not even displayed but they went through our stuff to find it which is the worst intrusion of privacy if these kind of things often happen i advise to everyone to be aware of this hotel
