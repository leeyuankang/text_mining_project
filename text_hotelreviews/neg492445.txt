the only small minus was the distance from the city centre but that was well compensated for by the excellent metro line immediately across the street from the hotel entrance by the private parking hall and affordability of the rooms in comparison with the city centre hotels besides since milan is a big city you probably need to use the metro line anyway to go about at some point however the appr min travel time to the city centre was rather long so we didnt feel like visiting the hotel during the day before dinner
