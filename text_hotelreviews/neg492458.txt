location is bit far from central even it s just next to metro station but with metro you still need mins at least it s at end station of to be arrived in the most popular area and shower room is just terrible mold on the wall in bathroom and water floating all over after seconds shower i personally won t recommend this hotel to you and i have to say i don t give bad review often because i respect the package they deliver but this hotel isn t worth for staying even with bargain price
