too far from the city center only one supermarket min walk away the interior looks a bit old be careful with the money on your card first hotel tried to pre authorize city tax that was already paid in cash on my card second upon check out they said they confirmed pre authorizations made after every day of our stay in a final payment a sum of all blocked sums i was told that no more payment will be made they just confirmed the previous ones but checking my card a bit later i discovered that sum for our nights stay was taken twice hotel insisted that they took money only once but my bank confirmed there was double payment request from the hotel and after my complaint bank cancelled one of the operations taking into account we stayed in the hotel in the beginning of our journey it wasn t really nice experience with money
