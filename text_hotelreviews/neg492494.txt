it is pretty difficult to reach it when the metro is not running the hotel is located at the end of a metro line absolutely no shop nearby if you want to buy something water for example please do it downtown there was a strange persistent unpleasant smell in the room situated on the first floor coming probably from outside beds towels bathroom were utterly clean but we couldn t contain the smell even with closed windows sorry for that otherwise the hotel meets high standards
