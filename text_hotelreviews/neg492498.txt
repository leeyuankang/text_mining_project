horrifying hotel restaurant we had a salad nicoise which people in nice would commit suicide over a risotto that basically came down to boiled basmati rice with a white looking sauce disgusting and some porkmeat with mushrooms straight out of a can also one of our glasses had a big fracture in it we requested the get a new empty glass to pour the wine in to the bartender told us we where wrong and the glas was not broken it was just an effect ridicoulous plusside we had many great laughs about the whole situation with each other the food being that bad means that the food and beverage manager simply does not give a next time i will get another hotel even though the rooms where great
