we booked the hotel based on its lovely pool and spa and it wasnt until after we checked in that they told us we would have to pay euro each extra to use it we didnt bother booking com should make this apparent before customers confirm thier booking not in the smallprint of the confirmation email afterwards also they were going to charge us for breakfast so we went to a nice clean cafe globe across the street and had a lovely croissant and coffee each for euros in total i would recommend all guests do that
