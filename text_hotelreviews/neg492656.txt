bed was very hard and uncomfortable spa is not a spa as i would expect especially for the money but rather a pool with a small steam room and sauna oh and a warm not hot hot tub if i had paid the euro per person charge plus another for a swimming cap i would have wasted my money the reception staff were indifferent to any request no matter how simple and the concierge actually gave us false info re the duomo when advised so they could not make the same mistake again the reaction was once again indifference the ladies at breakfast were very pleasant as were the housekeeping staff though turn down service was only carried out on of nights though a kettle was provide there were only bog standard coffee sachets and only yes just tea bag provided with a plastic spoon that melted when placed in hot water that for me sums up the hotels real quality standard
