the hotel suffers of a common disease in milan hotels panorama it feels business all around the main clientele is clearly business which means you have groups of business people buzzing around from one conference room to another outstanding the number of signals pointing to conference rooms and the like this takes away a lot from the charme and that s the main issue of the visconti palance it lacks any charme if you are looking for a romantic stay it delivers so so position is not the best if your plan is to explore milan however there is an underground station very close by which is good the room was rather small but still comfortable wifi is free only in the slow version if you want fast connection you pay on top in this is quite anachronistic parking is outrageously expensive but in line with other hotels to be fair
