on the second evening we stayed there there has been a very long power outage during which the customers were left alone and with no information but more important is that no emergency light was on the emergency exits were not indicated and the backup power did not start confirmed the morning after by the hotel personnel this is a huge security risk if i were the manager i d send at least someone with a torch on each floor to guide and reassure the customers in case of need it was pitch dark with no emergency lights i wonder how security checks are done in this hotel we had to read the security exits map on the room door with our mobile lights to get to the ground floor as we had planned the evening out with friends on the emergency stairs there were any sort of stuff piled up from chairs to black big sacks the ones usually used for the garbage what would have happened in case of a real emergency the morning after when we checked out we complained at the reception but they seemed totally uninterested and told us some clich excuses and that s all also the wellness area is not like in the pictures the walls in the jacuzzi area are peeling off and have cracks the sauna and the hammam are so small that it would be uncomfortable to be there in more than persons
