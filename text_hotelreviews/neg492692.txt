some of receptionists were sooo uneducated and not brilliant for sure long story short i lost my credit card somewhere else but didnt cancel it to be able to use it in the hotel and flights etc the receptionist accused me to use stolen card even he has my name and i have my passport with me he still couldnt understand how a card can work after being lost after min argue thank god an experienced woman probably manager came and apologized quiet alot
