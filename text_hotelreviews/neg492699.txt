the whole branding just doesn t fit the hotel anymore it is very clear that the hotel has seen its best days a decade ago example in the hotel brochure it will tell you how detail oriented the staff wants to be etc truth of the matter is that they haven t even changed their clocks everywhere yet over a week after the time change reception staff need to learn to smile and breakfast staff need to pick up its drinks service and be more friendly the hotel decor and furniture is in an urgent need of renovation it seems nothing has been replaced since it was opened a couple of decades ago this was also very noticeable in the lobby and gym walls are very thin so you will definitely hear your people in the room next to you when they take a shower etc
