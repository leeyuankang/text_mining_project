we had to pay an extra to use the pool including to buy compulsory swimming caps and this was only for one day so once you have the caps the pool costs an extra per day we were not told this until after we had made our non cancellable booking a staff member told us the incorrect amount too low for the pool and i signed for this lower amount then when we went to pay extra costs at checkout they had changed the invoice after i had signed it to the higher amount without mentioning it to me not only is this illegal but it was very badly handled and the staff were very rude about it wifi was very slow and only permitted for devices for the room i connected with my iphone and asked if i could rather change and connect with the laptop this was not possible
