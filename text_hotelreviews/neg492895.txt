room looked completely different than in the photos a lot older the nice shower from the pictures did exist but it was broken only one of the body nozzles worked no power sockets near bed room directly below the dark metal roof therefore too hot to even sleep ac was broken inactive breakfast only toast white buns no juice the one they had was mixed with sirup very low quality mozzarella no fresh fruit only canned fruit plus they were decorated with anis which ruined the taste all remaining stuff was mostly very sweet service okay only the minimum giving the key asking for credit card which i don t consider good service location out of the city center in a rather shady seeming district min from next metro station
