the bathroom was too packed the shower area too small to move with the big shower from the ceiling not a hanging flexible shower it made taking a shower more uncomfortable i haven t come across such toiletries in the bathroom in a hotel in similar containers hung on the walls were liq soap shampoo body gel all the same and no bar soap so i properly took a shower after moving to another hotel no meals in room service or a place to eat in the hotel except for morning breakfast buffet location is a bit far away from city center and metro no solid food in places around they open in the evening and close soon the do not disturb sign didn t tell anything to a cleaner she knocked at the door i had to wake up and tell her there was a sign on the door didn t it mean anything her reply was yes but do i need a cleaning the staff in general was nice and polite except for one receptionist luca who really made me upset and disappointed of my stay the receptionist didn t allow my son visit me in the room the purpose of my visit was to see my son on international volunteer service in italy and explore milan together the explanation was the rule or even law in italy not allowing guests in single rooms i couldn t believe my ears the receptionist said we could meet in common areas of the hotel but not in my room so in the morning after calling me from the reception and my confirmation like in every hotel it is done he didn t allow my son to come to my room in the evening the same at first his behavior was rude to me not even what he said but how he said after my verbal argumentation he calmed down and explained what can i do this is italy there is a law i m sure he s a good man whom i don t want to harm by this review i assume the receptionist was instructed by the management and this was not his initiative
