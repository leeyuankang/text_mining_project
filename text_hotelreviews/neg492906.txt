the room was not like the photo it s tiny clean but very very small and a very small bed bathroom shower barely fits one person and the though it has jet spray heads they did not work practically no toiletries besides a tiny bottle of a in shower shampoo bath which is just unusable the hairdryer on the wall came straight out of the but it s just workable the tv is led and about a pc monitor size wifi was free but at times unreliable
