horrible hotel everything starting from very unpleasant staff very uncomforatble shower small room was awful spa center is working till or p m wich is very inconvenient because you want to relax in the pool or sauna after a long day of stolling around the city the shower in our first room was broken so we had to pack our luggage move to another room without any help because the receptionist couldn t here the phone call for minutes and then unpack again and no apologise if it ought to have been so will never recomend this hotel and never stay in any hotel of the chain again
