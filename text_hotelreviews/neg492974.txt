location not great minute walk to the square and shopping centre the dome there were no tea and coffee facilities in the room or bath robes which considering the price to stay i found hard to believe the staff were ok but not overly obliging we had to move rooms as we were invaded by ants which were crawling all over the floor and bed we discovered that the large window door in our room could not close properly this allowed the ants to gain access
