during our stay there was construction work happening in a building opposite this meant there was loud drilling noises at which affected our sleep in addition the toilet was too close to the bed and did not have a proper door that could shut as it had a sliding door instead perhaps it would have been better to put the toilet either upstairs or round the corner away from the bed
