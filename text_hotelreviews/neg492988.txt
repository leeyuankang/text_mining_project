room size i understand that i booked a standard sigle room i got assigned to a room that hadn t even a table or a chair for business travelling a workstation no matter how small is essential when i asked for a different room the reception claimed the hotel was full typical response and i suggested that they bring a table to my room since there was enough space very shortly afterwards the room service came with a small furniture and no chair i had to sit on the bed bringing the furniture close which by the way was so short i had to duck to type on the keyboard of my laptop mold on the bathroom unbelievably low water pressure impossible to take a shower
