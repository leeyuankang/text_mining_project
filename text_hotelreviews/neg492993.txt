the nights stay here is the biggest disappointment of this trip first night we checked in around but a very bad suite reserved for us it s close to the elevator noisy dark and also poor utility in the bathroom second day the room is changed to higher floor with better quality to the room fee but the ac really not working properly every time reported to the receptionist there s no proper reaction and every time a bell boy who can t even understand english is always sent up to us what this s the quality of a suite room worth over almost a night though at the end the handsome manager gave us a total room fee discount but still can buy a very satisfied trip back to us in a word there s no time re visit i m very sorry about this
