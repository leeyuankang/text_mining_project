both the breakfast and the dinner needs improvement for the breakfast they need to focus on quality but for the dinner it is both quality and the quantity they should improve we had a half board booking and the dinner was served in very small quantities i suggest to eat somewhere else also the room temperature is controlled centrally thus you cannot adjust it based on your needs
