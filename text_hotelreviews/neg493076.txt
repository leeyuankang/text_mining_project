the breakfast especially on the friday was posibly the worst food i ve have every had the misfortune to experience most of it had been there all week salad type but the scrambled egg sausages were to say the least discusting the smell of the eggs were unbelievable at first i thought it was me so i put egg bacon sausages tinned tomatoes which i like normally the smell was not good and when i took mouthful of the egg it came straight back out i won t go any further but needless to say if i can smell the food is off how can the waiting staff not on my experience room only very clean and comfortable eat out
