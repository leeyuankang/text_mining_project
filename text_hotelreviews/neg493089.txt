breakfast was the worse i have tried in europe ever they tried to sell it for euro and i found it was euro on booking com but even this was a rip off everything was dirty and coffee machine was discusting they need to redo this from scratch because the memory was enough to ruin our experience of the hotel which really is impressive upon arrival best western hmm mm they should audit their chains also upon paying things didn t add up they use a calculator to make price and i was questioning price and she had to recalculate i m still not sure the previous authorisation to come off was correct and will likely have to contact my bank after to ensure i was not overcharged we shall see once back home i don t know why this is a star now we stay in a star next to sans siro that has everything this hotel does and more hmm mm
