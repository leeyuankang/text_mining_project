during my nights stay several valuables goods were stolen from the room security is zero in this hotel the staff support was also near zero they behaved almost like a neutral party simple observer taking no responsibility i could talk with a manager about days after the facts and all i got were promises but no progress feedback till now i appealed to best western hotel chain customer care service but with same little results so far so that a stay supposed to cost me eur was finally could have stayed in a much better and safe hotel for less so be aware and think twice when you choose to stay in that hotel
