even though it stated that there is air conditioner in the room it was not operative due to the time of the year but it was pretty hot outside they didn t have any blankets but the regular hot one so as for temperature convenience it wasn t great finally we managed to open the windows to allow some fresh air to ventilate the room no comfortable hangers in the bathroom and no ventilation from it
