the staff was not very helpful we were at hotel and heard that the room is not ready chek in time she proposed us go for pizza or sth not even proposed to store our luggage the wifi was working so so the corridors and the room itself are very stinky smell of cleaning chemicals or some other stuff is overhelming the studio room is located very far from the reception in different wing of building lot of walking and easy to get lost the studio is dark rooms are located under roof windows which are unable to open stinky and the worst of all the description clearly states that the room includes dishes and cutlery nothing about extra payments but when we came we found empty cupboards and a note that dishes are available for the extra payment night what use of having a studio with annex without dishes
