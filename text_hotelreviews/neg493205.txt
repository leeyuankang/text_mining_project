beware the place is luxurious but not safe at all i was robbed during my stay there and i strongly feel that a hotel staff must have been an accomplice in the theft my luggages were broken and most of my valuable belongings were taken away and most awful of all the receptionist was dealing with me alone despite the hotel manager was informed of the incident the robbery was not treated serious nor as emergency the manager did not turn up or bother to face me after what happened i was very much disappointed by such behavior
