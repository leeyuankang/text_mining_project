upon arrival i was informed that the bank card i had used to reserve my booking didn t have enough money on it they could have told me this much earlier so that i might trasfer money into that account or prepare cash but they didn t so be prepared to pay up front in cash at least part of the cost otherwise you won t be able to check in and don t expect them to warn you about any problem they will save it as a surprise for when you check in when i tried to change my dates via the booking com website it wouldn t allow me instead i had to contact the property when i checked in my bill contained the old dates and a larger overall cost we eventually sorted it out and i only had to pay for the nights i had requested but the final invoice contains a lot of scribbling and handwritten editing very unprofessional check the invoice they give you and if it contains any unoffcial editing ask for another one the sound proofing needs improvement
