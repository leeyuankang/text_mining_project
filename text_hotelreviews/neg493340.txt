it was warm in the room and we were told they couldn t turn on the air conditioning system as it wasn t turned on for the season it was april so some days it was cold and they needed the heating on and some days it was warm then they couldn t turn on the air conditioning beacuse they had to choose air conditioning or heating this resulted in degrees in the room and problems sleeping they solved it with a fan but the fan was very loud when it was turn on
