no electric kettles in the room hence no complimentary hot beverages unfortunately came across a number of unfriendly receptionists inconsistent professionalism and politeness gestures made can often found be very rude almost felt like we were a burden to them this quality of service left a very bad impression and severely impacted our willingness to come back to this hotel therefore would not recommend friends and family to consider their stay here considering it being a star hotel and in comparison to other star hotels services and facilities are not up to the standards therefore another downside to this is the poor value of money hotel lacked variety in dishes served for breakfast limited vegetatrian vegan options
