the room was small there was a big screen but the tv was tiny which i found funny the bathroom was the worst part though the shower doesn t have a door in it the bidet is exactly behind the door so for example if someone wants to enter the bathroom and is pooping it can be dangerous and a bit tricky there was no shampoo
