the hotel doesn t have a pool the rooms are very nice but very small because of the mirrors from the rooms i didn t realize the rooms are so small anyway for a short city break are ok but if you have many clothes with you there are no space to put them the breakfast is not so perfect as in other comments you cant find eggs only some scrambled eggs you cant find different cheese there is only one cheese like the one you put in a cheeseburger
