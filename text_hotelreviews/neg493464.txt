the breakfast is poor and has a limited number of items the same each day the rooms are very dark all of them because the windows are covered by a lot of iron bars which we found very strange and the room bathroom specific items are rather of a low quality despite the large size of the room we found it to be very uncomfortable small table etc the personal is very unfriendly and even ironic the hotel is far away from anything at the hotel corner each evening ladies prostitutes are waiting for clients i don t recommend this hotel and wouldn t come back here in future next time i will chose a small hotel in milan center
