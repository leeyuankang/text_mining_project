given the hotel rating one would expect more options and a higher quality level for breakfast in house dining also only offers a rather poor selection of hot dishes wifi had a tendency to disconnect and was not very stable left the car in the garage to keep it safe but upon departure some unknown stubborn sticky fluid dropped on my vehicle from the ceiling most likely from some leaking pipes staining the side crystal to a large extent i was forced to drive to an auto wash station to attempt to clean it after days it hasn t still been cleared and that s pretty annoying
