a young tall man working at the reception was very arrogant absolutely unpleasant to deal with unfortunately he didn t have a name tag so i don t know his name i used to work as receptionist at a hotel a few years ago so i can say for sure that his customer service skills are really poor the young ladies working there were very nice and friendly though
