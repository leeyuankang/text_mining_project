no coffee maker the staff gave me a cup of hot water when i went down to ask about it which was nice but having a coffee maker in the room to begin with would have been nice also much much farther from central milano than i thought it would be use the subway to your full advantage the shower in our room was very leaky as well if you don t put a towel at the edge the water all drops out and causes a huge puddle
