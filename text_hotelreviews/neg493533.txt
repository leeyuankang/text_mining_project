there was an awful odor coming from the bathroom i asked if they could fix it while i was gone but i came back the smell was still awful and they didn t check on me about that again the other problem was that the walls were not soundproof at all i could hear the people from the next room even if they whispered unfortunately our neighbors were very loud i called the hotel at to do something about it because they were almost having a party they sent someone over right away but the noise didn t stop
