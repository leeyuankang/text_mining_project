extremely poor service for a hotel which boasts stars i booked a double room for a couple which listed a large double bed with minimum inches width and they put us in a single room as they were fully booked and had no other room available the bed was nowhere near the size advertised more like a good single bed and neither my wife nor myself managed to sleep properly i was against the wall and she fell off the bed twice they managed to find us a double room for the second night compare the first two pictures with the actual double bed on second night but refused to refund us or apologise for that matter for the first night mix up the duty manager was apparently too busy to see us even back to hospitality school i m afraid
