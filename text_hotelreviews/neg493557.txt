breakfast was not very good it was lacking in variety and tasted cheap the hotel was more stars than but given the price i have no real complaints except that we booked months before arriving and the first night we were put in a disabled room which we did not like the wet room bathroom and there apparently were no other rooms available until the next day we are not disabled and never requested such a room and so we were a little surprised by this
