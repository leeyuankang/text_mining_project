rooms they just simply badly designed look and furnished modern but very small for a modern hotel and totally useless blows and whistles for instance tiny tv behind huge dark glass separate blue light in the bathroom and blue green in the room staff can control air conditioner from front desk tree stump instead of bedside table cool yes but why extra power socket would be more useful but lets talks about real issues there is no closet instead of that there are hangers where you can put clotes and leave it very close to your bed just hangers for persons no shelves just a tiny spot for one midsize suitcase wifi is decent if you want to work but chair and table are a joke you will barely find a place for a small laptop forget about papers or anything else the table is that small the shower cabin is just a glass wall with no door so water was everywhere in a toilet after every shower though cleaning ladies did a good job and everything was clean and dry right after the breakfast no kettle inside the room there is no place for it requested king bed got twin bed not so comfortable breakfast room is not up to capacity of the fully booked hotel we had to wait every day to find a table but staff was really good and every table was cleaned and ready a second after it was free exactly the same breakfast every day there are no facilities that stars hotel should have such as sauna fitness center and others summary hotel is good for a short stay if you are not going to work or spend time in a room and don t expect starts it is a decent stars hotel
