there weren t anything we didn t like however it would ve been slightly easier if we had a kettle in the room as i had to make my way to the hotel bar every time i had to make milk for our baby with that note i would still need to compliment the staff as they were extremely patience and accommodating to my requests so a big thanks to them all for improving our stay in milan
