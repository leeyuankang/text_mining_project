room to a smaller size if you have big suitcases and more clothes it will be a challenge where to keep all to change bin in the bathroom and the plastic table for towels was broken and kept falling down does not cost that much to change it but it would give extra value for the room itself during breakfast guys were way to fast to take the plates felt like we have to rush to eat and go out very friendly thought but would of appreciated more relaxed breakfast without rushing
