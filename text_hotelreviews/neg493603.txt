the negatives the room was terribly hot even with a climate control panel it was mid november and my partner and i were sweating profusely during the night to the point she had to call reception a man came up at to open our window which is bolted shut with a key as we were on the floor this still didn t help really and despite the time of year the heat in the room was pretty infuriating at times the maids although they do a cracking job decided to repeatedly knock loud one morning even though we d left a do not disturb sign on the door this is because we d had a late night and weren t planning on rising until a time after the maids had done their round the next day my partner was out and i was in the shower when the maids knocked yet again as i d forgotten to remove the sign however upon opening the door they had gone the following day one of them collared my partner and said they are paid on a room to room basis and that they had not been in our room for days so they pretty much frog marched her back in order to clean our room my issue with this is sometimes i work away on nights and sleep in hotels during the day if someone in this hotel is doing something similar to that i m sure he would not want to have his door banged on or times over a minute period at the signs should be adhered too
