everything was perfect except for when we went to pay the remaining of the stay the night deposit was already taken out from our account we were told we need to pay the full amount then and that the deposit will be returned to our credit card within days this does not seem fair especially because we were not aware and somehow i am left without a significant amount of money stuck for what could be a month s time
