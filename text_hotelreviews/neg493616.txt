staff attitude is annoying especially reception coming back at night i realized that my room had not been cleaned at all but when i complained at the reception a male staff replied something like i just started my job today so i am sorry but i don t know about this we will check and then he called me soon after to ask if i had accidentally left do not disturb sign on the door obviously not the day after at checkout i asked to another lady receptionist if they knew about the uncleaned room problem yes we are aware and we will check with the cleaning lady that s it wow now i understand that sometimes accidents can happen and i am not so upset for unclean room but much more for the arrogant and self centred attitude of both receptionists i travel often and it is clear to me that this hotel don t train its staff to be service oriented they actually made me feel like i was bothering them and there was no real apology no nice gesture it s a shame because arimboldi hotel is otherwise good in a convenient location with excellent price point
