it would be better if a bigger map of milan was available so you could see where the hotel was situated in relation to central milan it would also have been useful to have details of buses i e number and where the destination was also it needed more information of nearby places to eat like the shopping complex down the road it would have been nice if there evening menu had lasagne or bolagnes just a little more choice although i appreciate they do not adveertise they provide a restaurant service
