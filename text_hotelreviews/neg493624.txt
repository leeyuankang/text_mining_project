the location of the hotel is close to the last stop of the subway it s quite a long ride from the city when i arrived in the middle of the night the area seemed pretty dodgy groups of young men were hanging out on the streets it was pretty dark so altogether rather unwelcoming the hotel stands next to some dilapidated building and is enclosed by huge blocks of apartment buildings first time inside the bathroom i could not open the plug of the sink when i looked under i saw it had been fixed with some sticky tape i readjusted everything and it worked again but the way it was fixed appeared pretty unprofessional when i missed the last train one night the taxi ride from the city cost
