location is dire old industrial estate area being redeveloped breakfast amongst the worst i have ever had bar the fresh fruit powdered egg for the scrambled eggs coffee undrinkable no restaurant and none for miles around literally minimum minute drive away for the nearest pizzeria unless you count the burger bar and kfc at a nearby multiplex as restaurants poor bar only two elevators so you could wait minutes at busy times like breakfast checkout
