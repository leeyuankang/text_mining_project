although we had mentioned that we are with an year old child they wanted to charge us extra in the booking com page it was mentioned that all children are welcome and in the description of the room it was also mentioned that you can add an extra bed but they refused to give us the room in the deal and wanted to charge us euros it was in the middle of the night and everybody was super tired we had booked rooms and they receptionist didn t accepted the clear info on our booking it took half an hour to convince him to give us a room we were also overcharged during check out by counting the child for city tax which is supposed waived for children
