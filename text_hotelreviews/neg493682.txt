little bit messy the the restaurant during the breakfast so crowded funny and also a bit annoying the tv in the room at first sight the room has a big a bit dark glass mirror and the tv is located behind which is really tricky design but you can not use the remote control only in cm distance because of the the glass thickness btw my feeling is not star just a good design star hotel
