my only complaint is that i was staying at this hotel to meet a friend we both booked a double room and paid the same price for it i thought my bed was surprisingly small for a double when i arrived i only realised after the second night when i saw my friend s room that was actually a double that they had given me a single room when i called reception to say it to them they were not very helpful and said that i should have complained earlier and they could have changed my room they said that they have no single beds only one and a half beds which didn t really matter because my booking clearly said double to be fair i should have made note of it earlier but i asked for late check out to compensate which i thought was a very fair request but it was refused quite rudely
