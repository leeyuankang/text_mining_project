the bathroom had hair in the shower and sink disgusting the toilet seat had urine stains on it the breakfast was horrible except for the fresh fruit and freshly squeezed orange juice which you have to ask for and i found this out by chance after nearly choking on the artificial grapefruit juice everything else was processed or what i would consider cheap quality the cakes were nice and freshly baked however loaded with too much sugar so it put me off on the first bite there wasn t even an option if didn t want to eat powdered scrambled eggs for a star hotel i was really disappointed
