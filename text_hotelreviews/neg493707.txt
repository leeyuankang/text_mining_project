the hotel says that it is a star one however no proper restaurant for dinner and no good breakfast for example especially very poor selection of cheese and dairy products isn t the hotel in italy no fitness room and finally in the lobby area there were some staff walking idle and chatting around while the receptionists looked they don t like their job without a smile in their face this brings a negative atmosphere in the hotel entrance and shows in my opinion a lack of managerial attention the hotel location and capacity could be served in a much better way by increasing the quality of the restaurant at least the breakfast and by letting some smile and motivation into the staff and a basic and good ventilated fitness room would be a plus nice to have
