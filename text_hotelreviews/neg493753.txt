we were put into an odd shaped room where the tv was slanted at an angle away from the bed the placement of the bed to the weird angle of the wall had you tripping into the wall trying to get to the restroom the mattress was like sleeping on a slab of concrete and for such a highly rated hotel it was a huge disappointment to have flat shapeless pillows it was overall just an awkward space that was not comfortable at all
