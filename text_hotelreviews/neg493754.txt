location is a bit far from the center and next to the hotel you have an old institute building waiting for restoration or to be removed at this time it appears with broken windows and grafitti we are in an industrial quarter and next to the hotel you have a lot of storehouses combined with new hotels however people also live here in both new and older blocks of flats unfortunately you cannot open the windows of security reasons however the cleaning staff have a key to open it when cleaning the rooms you have not very much daylight because of bars or blinders outside the windows however you have an aircondition and it works very well the outdoor area to the hotel is nothing to write home about reception area nice designed but no lobby area just a bar and unfortunately not comfortable furnished but it looks nice you can sit at the restaurant tables the hotel still has the same security man walking around in reception area the problem is that he looks very unfriendly and actually he is reception staff friendly if asked about something but unfortunately do not expect a welcoming word during your stay i am sure the reception staff has a good time talking with each other but hello how about a smile and a welcoming word i hope you are listening my conclusion in my opinion we do not talk about a star hotel more a nice star however i will come back again and i am sure we will see some improvements
