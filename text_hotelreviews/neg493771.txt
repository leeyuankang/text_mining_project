location is far from center and next to the hotel you have an old building with broken windows and to be removed at some time not the best view all windows at the hotel need a speciel key to be opened and only the cleaning staff use it you have to be happy about the aircondition the windows have outside bars that means you do not have much daylight and no sunshine coming into your room some of the staff in reception seems to be a bit arrogant and they never say good day or good night in fact they give an impression of you are not welcome or we do not care style i suppose it is a security person you have in front of the reception walking around unfortunately he never smile or seems to be nice
