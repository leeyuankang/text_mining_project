location isn t very good if you are their for leisure takes mins to get into central milan and public transport seems to shut down after midnight making it very difficult and expensive to get back at night we asked for two dressing gowns and they came with brown stains which was off putting the windows have bars over them and don t open which isn t good for ventilation
