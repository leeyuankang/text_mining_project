room is too small coz we ve got the angle room no space enough to open large luggage and the room use too much glass mirror i m not sure if it temper glass but for the design issue this made room look bigger which is not safe especially bed head should not use glass if guest lean on the glass while they sit and read on the bed could be really bad accident if it break down
