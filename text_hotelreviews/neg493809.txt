i had a great holiday until it came to check out where i was confronted by matteo i was told to pay per room i did not know what this was for as it was badly explained and when i queried what it was for metteo started raising his voice and shouting at me to pay and if i did not he was going to call security i replied by saying ok i will pay you now but i will call the hotel tomorrow for more clarification to which he replied you will pay now and started shaking in anger i didn t expect that kind of behaviour from an experienced member of staff working at a hotel put a bad memory of the hotel and bad connotations of my trip to milan in my head
