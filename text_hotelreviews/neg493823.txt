the reception staff who checked us in was very rude booked double rooms but there of us adults and kids i asked her if we can have the year old kid sleep with us we will just pay extra she said impossible and showed us our reservation paper i asked her if we can change the double room to a triple room she again said impossible she mentioned that our booking com reservation was only for double rooms and we will void our reservation and pay the total amount if we change it she wanted us to book additional room which we did so different rooms for the of us and we have to go back and forth to our rooms as most of our stuff are shared in the same luggage but as it turned out there was still a vacant triple room which she could have adjusted one of the rooms given to us room also had some problems the room was too warm degrees c so i asked someone to fix it they sent someone and opened the window and reset the airconditioner but the next day my daughter had a nosebleed and the room was still very warm degrees c so i called in the reception in the morning and told them to fix it which they said they will but when we arrived in the evening the room was still warm and i again called the reception and informed me that they don t have any staff to take care of it and asked me to just transfer to another room this is one of the worse hotel experience i had not the worst as the hotel itself is nice and clean while most of their reception staff are well dressed many of them don t seem to be happy at what they do i still think that the hotel was badly managed you can always see people lining up to check in or check out no one seems to be bothered if they receive serious complaints from the guests
