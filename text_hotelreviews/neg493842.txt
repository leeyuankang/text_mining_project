major problem was with the booking dept beginning of july i booked a room for november about weeks or so before my staying i got an email saying my credit card was not valid and to enter a new one within hrs otherwise my booking would be cancelled i did so but in the following hrs i received the same mail again i decided to phone the hotel i spoke to two different ladies the second of which contradicted what the first one had told me the first said i could not enter a new credit card but i must use the same one i had made the booking the second said the opposite according to them i received an email back in july about the credit card problem this is totally false because if that had been the case i would have done something back then so not to loose the booking why was it not automatically cancelled if they contacted me in july and i had done nothing why was my booking still confirmed at the beginning of november anyway beginning of november i get this email saying that my credit card is not valid and to provide a valid one within hrs i do so but this too is refused and i have hrs time to provide another or i loose my booking so i phoned the hotel itself and asked what they suggested to solve the situation i had tickets for the concert at arcimboldi so didn t want to change a hotel i booked back in july with a good rate to book another just a few days before my event as the employee remarked i was suggested i send my credit card number by e mail is this acceptable i decided not to do it and entered another credit card number which a good friend agreed to give and this time it was ok fortunately i had a lot of hassle and this hrs time threatens was very unpleasant since all the credit card numbers i gave were valid i checked with the bank and since no e mail was sent to me in july
