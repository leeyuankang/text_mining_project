make sure you don t get a room with a connecting door to the other room it will be impossible to sleep we tried to switch room but we were told the hotel was fully booked when we further complained that it was impossible to sleep because of the connecting door does not isolate the other room we were shouted at that the hotel is full checking on booking they had rooms left but the reception was very rude and not receptive of our problem at all not at all a star hotel approach on our and final night our room was changed and we managed to get a good nights sleep
