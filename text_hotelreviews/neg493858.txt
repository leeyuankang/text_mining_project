they did put us in a room for disabled people which was totally disappointing we went back to reception right away to complain and we were instantly offered a normal room looked like this is a normal procedure this made a really bad first impression its really really far from a star hotel absolutely no facilities no staff to offer to take your luggage you have to ask for it etc i would describe it as a really good star hotel double bed was just normal ones that are put next to each other it sounds not that bad but it was a big problel
