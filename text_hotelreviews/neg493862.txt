we wanted to change our reservation we even wanted to extent our booking but when we come to the hotel the host and hostess told us they cannot change the booking they can just give us a new room and we had to pay for all rooms it was incredibly stupid they didn t even try to understand and solve the problem it was a nightmare i cannot suggest anyone to stay at this money oriented hotel
