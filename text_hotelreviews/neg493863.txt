the hotel is very convenient for milano bicocca university but it is out of the city center it is very easy to get to more touristic areas but it takes minutes with public transportation the area is not very attractive in the evening hotels in milano are expensive still the price tag of this hotel was too high but considerably cheaper than similar alternatives in the city center
