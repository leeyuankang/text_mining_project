the room was very tiny there were no drawers or shelfs to place one s items this was part of an extended stay in europe and i had more luggage than just for a couple of days so i needed some space to store it also no hooks for the coats the room was equipped with different lights with no convenient lighting over the working table which was tiny and in a shape of a triangle not enough space for a computer and a notebook there were only two outlets in the room my daughter was with me so we had trouble charging our computers and phones at the same time
