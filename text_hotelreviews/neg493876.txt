we turned off the ac but there was anyways cold air coming out so i got sick during the night it was a twin beds room and on the bed there were only bed linen and in the closet there was one blanket so we needed to request another blanket we also requested slippers and as the mini bar was not filled up we also requested water also we requested help cause the tv didn t work half an hour later and after we went down to the reception again a guy came and brought fixed everything but he was visibly annoyed by our requests the tv remote control only worked from meter distance so it was impossible to use it while lying in bed the floor of the room was full of hairs from somebody else so gross
