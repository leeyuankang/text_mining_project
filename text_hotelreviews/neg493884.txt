i was given a room for disabled with two beds when i asked for a big bed i went for a run without a phone and got lost in town when i called from some restaurant to hotel the hotel reception refused in a rude manner to send or order a taxi to pick me up with this kind of manners and service the receptionist lady should work as a cleaning lady and not be allowed to speak to the clients
