the hotel charges euros per day extra than the booking price for local municipal taxation this should appear on the calculation of the daily price as it is unfair competition to other hotels the hotel and booking site mentions there is a shuttle service to the airport available for a price upon questioning it turned out that by shuttle service they meant an expensive bus from the central train station this is a joke as one can get a cheaper train from the station and it is by no means a shuttle service it should not appear at the website as such otherwise it is misinformation finally the hotel location is not ideal with street workers stopping cars for business just outside late at night and the hotel staff not really bothered with it
