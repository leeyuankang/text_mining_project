hotel is in the north of milan so you need to have a car hotel parking at an additional cost or use metro which is mins from hotel getting to center with metro takes around mins breakfast is typical for italian hotels some ham cheese and fruits could be better but as i said it s kind of an italian hotel standard unfortunately do not try scrambled eggs it s more a yellow goo than anything close to an egg air conditioning in our room seemed to malfunction and it was extremely cold only solution was to turn it off
