disappointing for a star hotel the bathrooms are badly set up the shower is wheelchair accessible but has no door so it is impossible to prevent water from going all over the floor the beds are a bit firm and the blankets provided not that warm power outlet in the bathroom had a short which caused the room to black out dinner was ok but staff seemed very under pressure even though there were not that many diners and many tables got the wrong orders ours was ok but took a long time and the waitress forgot our wine breakfast was average
