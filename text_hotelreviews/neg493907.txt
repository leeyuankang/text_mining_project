while fairly well connected to the centre via metro it was still a little difficult to find and located in the outskirts of milan we spent the whole day at the expo so we didn t really get a chance to explore the surrounding area but it looked like there wasn t much to offer in terms of shops or restaurants the quality of the breakfast food was excellent however i would ve liked to have seen a bit more variety also the coffee dispensed from the coffee machine was awful get a coffee from the bar instead yes it s included in the breakfast so there s no extra charge for that i m also very aware that the expo was going on at the time but we would have like to have been able to access our room before p m i am aware that this was difficult for them to arrange however i did try to put in a request the week before and it was never answered also other guests did get access to their room almost immediately after checking in around pm asides from this it was a great stay and we very much enjoyed our holiday
