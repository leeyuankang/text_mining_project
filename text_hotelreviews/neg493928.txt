we booked a normal double room and we expected to get that but instead they gave us a double room for disabled people and when we asked them why they said this is the only room available s the room was fine but u wont feel comfortable in the bathroom as its totally designed for disabled ppl the breakfast is a big disappointment the food they are offering is not enough and with bad quality ppl were waiting in lines just to have a cup of coffee or a orange juice no tea cups or glasses so u keep waiting for the staff to bring and when they do you will see a shocking view of ppl running and fighting to have a cup
