the plumbing of the building is missed up it didn t happen only in my room but also in my kids room the bathroom is flooded once you use the shower and the sink is always plugged the location is very far from everything it s a dead area no restaurants nearby except the fast food ones in the nearby mall nothing special around the area not even the malls would not recommend it for tourists it s good for short business trips
