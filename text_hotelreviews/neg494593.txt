parking was important to us hotel never replied to my booking com online inquiry about the parking proceedure it was marked that the hotel has parking but nowhere on the booking com it was mentioned that it is a valet parking at a fee of euro per day from the information on booking com we understood that parking is part of the property facilities and icluded couldn t use the safety box even after the instructions from the receptionist the hotel would be considered great if it were star property far from being best as star hotel
