despite the room was cosy it was quite noisy in the morning because of the street cars trams roadworks all these produced a lot of noise the window is equipped with a special glass section to reduce the noise didn t help a lot but this also blocks the flow of fresh air also i didn t like breakfast the only place where staff wasn t friendly at they asked to leave the dining room normally hotels never do this they just kindly ask if you would like something else to take because the buffet is going to be closed but not at this hotel the rest was quite good
