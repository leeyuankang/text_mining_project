our room was at first floor where the breakfast was served so it could be a bit noisy in the morning from time to time since the heavy door divides rooms from the salon i didn t mind it a lot but if someone has light sleep perhaps can ask for different floor other than that you can also get good rest since it is not a noisy area during the night which is important after long walks in lovely milan
