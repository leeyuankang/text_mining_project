we could not really open the window at least there was a huge glass panel that we didn t dare open the room was quite stuffy the coffee at breakfast was instant coffee and undrinkable only found out later that you can order good quality coffee from staff breakfast overall was only average definitely not a star hotel that being said the price is quite acceptable and we would book here again
