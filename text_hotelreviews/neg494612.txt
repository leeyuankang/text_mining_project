overall summary decent location but do not stay here if you want a decent night sleep or air con we stayed for nights and when we arrived in italy the temperature was a warm degrees the hotel had still been pumping out the heating and our room had had the balcony door shut all day so the room was like a furnace when we arrived at about a few issues prevailed contrary to the hotel description on booking com the hotel does not have air conditioning so we could not cool the room down and we i spoke to the hotel staff about the heat in the room they told me there was no air con and due to a law in milan they could only pump put warm air until told otherwise we did not have a window in our room we had a balcony door but this led on to a shared balcony for the whole floor that then led to the outdoor fire escape stairs meaning that any one could from the street or hotel could walk into oit room this was the main issue as it mean we could not go out for the day and leave the door open incase someone walked in so the room was a constant closed box with the heating on i told the hotel staff about the issues there was no room that they good move me to they had no fan they could lend us and they had no solution and although they were very polite were not much help we went out for the afternoon and eve for dinner hoping that maybe on our return the room would have cooled it had not neither of us could sleep and exasperated at i was down to the reception staff begging for them to do something or i d not be staying another night they took my pleas a bit more seriously and said they would change our room the next day to one with a window next day came room changed to one with a window on the main road we could cool the room down which was great but now on the busy road so it s a bit noisy but it was a much better improvement so all was ok we were now just knackered from bit having slept
