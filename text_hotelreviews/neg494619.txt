i stayed at best western hotel st george in milan that was the first time i chose the hotel the last day has spoiled completely all the impression of my staying as far as when i returned to my room i found out that my travel bag was searched and my money were stolen i cannot describe my disappointment and frustration i supposed the staff of such a hotel should respect its guests and their property and i was sure my things are safe in my room the room was not cleaned as it supposed to be but it was robbed i am still shocked and after this thing happened i was not even been contacted by the hotel manager to discuss the issue i am sure that someone from the staff has stolen the money and the hotel management should get aware of that and take appropriate measures taking into account the said above i cannot recommend the hotel at all
