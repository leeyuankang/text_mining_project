city tax for two for each night crazy we usually get our fridge welcoming refreshments included in the price this hotel leaves you with an additional charge which was a bit surprising for us i kept thinking that the receptionist was talking about extra orders from their bar very confusing and embarrassing if i have to go into some details about the room itself the shower grout could be refreshed as well as the silicone mould in hotel should never be present
