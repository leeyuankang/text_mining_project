the room smelt cigarettes i couldn t fall asleep because of this smell the corridor outside the rooms smelt repairs not a single hanger in the hall of the room the breakfast was a disaster the dining room was small and there was a queue to sit down at the table the choice of food was really poor it was really strange for a breakfast in italy i actually booked this particular hotel because i read in the reviews that they have lots of fruit and fresh juices but the fruit was little there was a juicer but no oranges to squeeze the staff at breskfast was nervous and messy
