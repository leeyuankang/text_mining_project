the only criticism relates to the buffet style breakfast weekdays weekends some guests came down minutes before the end time to find that breakfast items had run out and not replenished simply told that s all that there is when they asked this included bread rolls running out cold meats fruit and even the urn of americano coffee which had stood for ages and was strong and stewed anyway if folk have paid for breakfast then it should be plentiful and all items available until the end of the advertised time one tip we learnt from overhearing others ask for capuccino coffee the waitress serves it to you and it s hot freshly made and tasty much nice than the urn stuff
