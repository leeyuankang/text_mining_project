it seems the unbearably bad smell in the room is not the one and only problem with this hotel the regulator of air conditioner was broken so we had to almost freeze in the room and it was absolutely impossible to use the bidet unless you were very short legged breakfast was so so no coffee making mashine at all only made up coffee drink from thermos jug and empty omelette bowl nobody from the kitchen stuff was worried to supplement it on the whole the hotel is worth at most never in this hotel
