it s not clean this time i found contact lenses on my sink disgusting to say the least the staff can be rude anothe rcounter would open and they wouldn t call you seeing that you are queuing for service can be racist too although i m an nh member who spends every time i come to amsterdam alone funny how you are allowed to be that in a city that stands against discrimination nh are known for their rude staff i say that as a member my father was a member too would say the same the hotel is very old and in desperate need of renovation some cupboards are glued back together it s falling apart room service is terrible don t think that you ll get hungry at midnight and be served right away they have no problem answering the phone and telling you to wait in some rooms the phone is not working at all broken the price is rediculous for what you get services at neighboring hotels are much better i just happen to travel with people that love making last minute plans so it s always my last resort try the dutchstay hemp friendly apartment the albus hotel city centre the hampshire hotel eden or the ultimate luxury waldorf astoria
