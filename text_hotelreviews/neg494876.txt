dear sir hotel customer care i am currently staying in the nh carlton amsterdam the experience has been more than terrible when i arrived my booking via booking com did not showed the person in the reception was making me and asking me if i was sure what was my name asked me to return minutes latter they were able to find my reservation and i was given a room after hour and pm then i went out to eat and when i came back my key did not work the lady in the reception told me the key will not work if it is near a phone or a wallet after minutes waiting no other place happens this i got to the room and the tv did not work i called the reception and they told me to wait for minutes i had to go down and talk with the manager in charge so he could check the tv some else joined me and she found the tv did not work and offered to check it by a technician the day after she was trying not to even offer to change the room i insisted and finally agreed i had to pack and get down get a new key and change no follow up call if things were working they could not care less i do not know who is in charge but i guess they do not really care about the customer the experience or the property i understand things might go wrong but the staff is not enough not willing to solve problems or the customer i will take this to social media and review it on booking com
