although it was a great hotel to stay at the wi fi was terrible and would not work half the time even when i paid euros for the extra fast the wi fi is not even managed by the hotel so they couldn t do anything about it except removes the fees for the extra wi fi i paid if you are a professional looking to work and have access to a stable connection most of the time you couldnt even connect to facebook this hotel might not be the best choice also some of the power outlets where impossible to use with adapters and none of them where close to the bed none of them where in the bathroom making if impossible to use any curling or straightening irons
