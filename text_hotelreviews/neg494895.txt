unfortunately when checking in we had to pay a deposit and took an extra for city tax and deposit for if you use the mini bar or breakfast this was not mentioned on booking so be aware before coming as it may leave you short if paying by debit or credit card be aware they will give you the deposit back but in cash so you may receive hidden charges
