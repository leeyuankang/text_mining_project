the beds were hard and the hotel did nothing to change them despite request the room service was poor not properly cleaned and consumables not replaced no improvement despite complaint our plumbing had a problem and we were offered an upgrade but the offered room was smaller we requested a late check out and despite having been at the hotel for a full week were told it was against policy and we d have to pay an hourly rate we asked to see a manager on sunday but were told that no manager was on duty in the hotel it s a shame a hotel with potential let down by staff who do not see the need to provide good customer satisfaction i will not return to the hotel
