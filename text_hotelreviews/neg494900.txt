the hotel is dirty and run down drains did not work well in shower so hard to take a full shower bathroom sink drain also slow although the site indicates air conditioning there was no air conditioning to speak of in our room very very hot needs an update and i say this because we were paying euros a night for the room on the weekend this was certainly not good value
