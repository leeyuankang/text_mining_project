a lot of thing the staff was not helpful at all when we wanted to stay more in the hotel they looked like they want us to leave and one of the mangers kept increasing the price on us and the most descanting thing was the cleaning they say that they finish their shift at so for the hall stay we did get our room cleaned only on the first days that was so bad so bad so bad
