the room was in serious need of new carpet a new chair and curtains all were disgustingly stained dirty the door jams entries from the room to the terrace and the room to the bathroom didn t look like they had been cleaned in quite a while we were not comfortable walking around the room without shoes socks only were debatable but certainly not our bare feet we did not use the chair at all and covered it with a towel the bathroom overall was so so the towel drying rack was a bit rusty and creepy but that was mostly a visual issue we are not really very particular about these things normally but have never experienced a room such as this and it really was unexceptable for the price we have paid much less for much better at hotels in the past in premium locations so it was a bit disappointing
