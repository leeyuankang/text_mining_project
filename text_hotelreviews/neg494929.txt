nh carlton is part of the nh group upon our arrival they said that the hotel had been overbooked and that we had to move to another hotel which was further away from the centre of the city so we declined we ended up having to spend one night in the nh barbizon palace and then transfer back to our original hotel for the last three nights this was an inconvience and wasted time on our first night in amsterdam this happens a lot from what we witnessed just walking through reception this really put us off returning to amsterdam because even though we had a confirmed booking email in the nh carlton they gave our room to someone else very unreliable
