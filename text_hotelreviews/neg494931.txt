first of all during check in my credit card was overcharged for one extra room after my direct objection on he same day though i was told by the receptionist that the receptionist corrected it by herself i learnt during the checkout that it was a lie she did not make the necessary corrections at all this was confirmed by a much more experienced kind gentleman working in the reception secondly the room i was staying was not clean at all there were red fingerprints in the restroom door there was even no dress hanger at my room in the second day though it was clear that my shirts were drying in the chair there was no correction by putting something they even did not put clean plastics glasses for the second day after paying a fortune for two days these examples convinced me that i will never ever stay in this hotel again
