the room was dusty once i lay down to rest my whole body felt itchy i got few bug bites from it the bathroom smelled like sewage for the first day towels smelled like vinegar and it was very tough staffs are trying to be polite and patient but you can tell that they are getting irritated while we were checking in the most disturbing thing among all is that on the day one of the staff came into the room after knocking the door for few seconds without permission which was a big surprise but he did not even apologize for this action he just asked whether the fridge was fine or not and left the room
