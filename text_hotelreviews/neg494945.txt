i requested for the room to be modified before going as it was a special occasion yet they didn t do anything for this i have previously stayed in an nh hotel before for an occasion and they upgraded my room and brought gifts when i got there i tried explaining but the language barrier meant nothing was done to the room they didn t give me a menu to add balloons or other gifts at an additional price like they had done before which was a little disappointing as a little extra detail in the room would have made the holiday
