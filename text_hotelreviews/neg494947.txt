you should book if you want to stay in the heart of amsterdam in decent but not extraordinary conditions and you don t care that much about the money you pay the room we stayed was relatively small but clean enough to not get angry one thing that bothered us was that the person checking the bar was knocking and entering without waiting for an answer while i was taking a shower also if you use room service the price for delivering the order is very high overall bad value for money paid
