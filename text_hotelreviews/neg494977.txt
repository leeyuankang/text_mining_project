first of all the pictures don t look like the real thing the pictures make it look luxurious when it s not on arrival i was informed that breakfast is infact not included i have travelled the world and never once stayed in a hotel where breakfast wasn t included i was told i needed to pay an extra each per day for breakfast that s an extra on top of what i already paid we decided against that and just ate out our room stank of oldness and foostyness the decor is soo dated like s the room was tiny basic and it was dirty there was a panel on the ceiling hanging off the bathroom was filthy there was dirt in the bath the radiator had flaky paint and rust all over it i went into the wardrobe to get the iron and there wasn t one something i have never experienced in a hotel room i called reception and i was told there s a room on the floor with an iron looooong but i went up there it was a dingy little freezing cold room with an ironing board and iron started ironing and there was dirt all over the iron which went onto my white shirt luckily i had turned it inside out and it kept turning off overall i was extremely disappointed for the money i paid for this hotel i was expecting a lot more it was my boyfriends birthday and wanted it be to special this was advertised as luxury deal there was nothing luxury about it at all it should have cost a lot more than what i paid as well thank god i hadn t paid full price i ll know next time i go to amsterdam never to go back to this hotel
