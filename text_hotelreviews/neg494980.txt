when i arrived at the nh carlton we checked in and was given our room as soon as we got inside the room we could see the place had not been cleaned correctly and there was hairs on pilliow case and inside my bed i did make a complaint to reception as i could not sleep in that room as i felt very dirty after seeing hairs and items uncleaned i also took photos of the room as i couldn t believe this is standard we got at the nh carlton i felt my money was robbed as all we had was our room changed and that wasn t even clean either but by then we had spend long enough trying to sort out our room we accepted the hotel didn t care and tried to make the most of our holiday but never would i recommend any one to stay there
