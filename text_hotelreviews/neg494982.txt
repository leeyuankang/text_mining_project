mainly the only thing we didn t like was the bathroom it just needs a bit of updating as there was quite a bit of rust also toilet lid was badly discoloured i cut the underneath of my toe whilst in shower as the plug waste was badly eroded and had a sharp piece of metal sticking up though my toe bled it wasn t for long so didn t cause a fuss i managed to bend and take the sharp piece and threw it away save the next person having a sore toe but in saying all this seriously the shower was in good working order the bathroom served it s purpose and you go to amsterdam to get out and see the sites not to spend most of your time admiring the room bathroom lol
