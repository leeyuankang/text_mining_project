i have stayed in this hotel years ago and was happy with it so i was skeptical towards the reviews of other travelers boy was i wrong the hotel is in such a bad condition hard to believe this is possible in the middle of amsterdam carpets were soooo old and fitlhy dirty and by this i do not mean a spot here and there our bathroom stank of urine yellow spots behind the toilet the bathtub was just discusting the hotel corridors were smelly as well the only thing why we havent left immediately were the clean though old and washed towels and bedsheets this is not a four star hotel two stars maximum and absolutely not worth the money
