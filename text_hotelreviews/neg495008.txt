i had to pay for an upgrade and never even got the balcony room the sink must have a blockage as it wasn t clearing as it should it took a lot longer than it should the room was very noisy for the main street i expected that in the main square but not where we were with our room being on the first floor at the end of the corridor we heard every single other customer come and go for this being my brithday i was willing to spend more money for the occasion but felt let down having stayed in cheaper places to a better quality i d go back to amsterdam but not this hotel
