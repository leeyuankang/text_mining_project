the hotel was not properly cleaned and maintained housekeeping was poor although the staff was very nice and friendly the trash on the floor of the hallway has been there for perhaps over two days since we arrived walls and carpets are obviously old and dirty one light of our room kept flickering the toiletries in the bathroom were not complete for example there was a shampoo bottle but no shower gel bottle perhaps they were understaffed during our stay because housekeeping only got to clean our room at i know because we got back to the hotel by bed linens were not ironed wifi was very slow
