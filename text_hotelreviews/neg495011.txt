the bedroom carpet in our room really needed replacing due to staining but i believe the management have a programme of reburshment well underway small bar in the foyer didn t seem to be manned even though it stated it was open from to didn t actually see anybody use it during our day stay which was a shame as it would have been nice to use it at the end of a days sightseeing rather than rely totally on outside bars
