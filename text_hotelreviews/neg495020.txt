we were asked if we wanted to upgrade our room for an extra euro a night which we jumped at so was very shocked when we saw our superior room was tiny and had not been decorated in a long time the price we paid was rediculous for the room we were given dread to think the size of a standard room i phoned reception to check we had been given an upgrade i was told yes and their standard rooms are even smaller the bathroom was tiny and the shower was terrible we spent almost for nights and the room was a massive let down we paid half that for nights in rotterdam at nhow and the room was out of this world
