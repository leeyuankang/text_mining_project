as most hotels in central amsterdam they are overpriced this hotel is no exception to pay an extra per day for the breakfast buffet on top of the already high room rate is just ridiculous the buffet did not look that great to suggest such exorbitant rate would be justified i only had breakfast in the hotel one morning and instead just had breakfast for less than half the price in one of the cafes nearby or simply grab some nice food and a coffee from one of the nearby bakeries the room was overlooking one of the streets with restaurants and bars so thu sun night usually means drunk people yelling off the top of their voices until in the morning the room s windows weren t sealed that well to cancel out the noise in fact the first night i got up twice to check that all the windows were closed completely which they were but it was just that noisy
