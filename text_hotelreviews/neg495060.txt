the room was described to me as a suite upon check in so i accepted it sight unseen however it turned out that it was just a badly laid out over sized space with a filthy and threadbare carpet and scruffy furniture plus despite repeated requests the teabags in my room were not replenished certainly not worth the euros per night i paid for it
