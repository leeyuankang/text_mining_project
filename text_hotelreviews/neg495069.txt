one of the staff members here was very rude because i asked him for water he told me to shut up in front of other guests and was so intimidating and rude the director is investigating and offered us a free ride to the airport for compensation but that kind of behaviour by reception staff was absolutely disgusting and have never experienced that anywhere before all other staff were amazing but this shouldn t have happened at all just because i asked for a jug of water
