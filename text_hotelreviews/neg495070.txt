hotel was dismal shabby and dirty although staff were friendly the systems were poor eg check in procedure took almost an hour we requested times that the flashing light on our phone be switched off nobody came ended up putting a pillow on it our room was advertised with a terrace huh this was feet wide and you would have had to climb out of the window to stand on it it was filthy with cigarette ends and used condoms
