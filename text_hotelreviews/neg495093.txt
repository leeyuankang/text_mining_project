the bathroom was very small you have to close the door just to use the toilet there were broken bath tiles on the wall and the maid never gave us fresh towels even though we left them on floor as instructed to but most of all my very expensive bottle of chanel perfume was stolen from the room my guess is it was the maid i d never stay there again
