we had an issue when checking in when i tried to pay for the room with my visa travel money card the hotel computer system reported the card as being denied when there were adequate funds on the card to pay for my reservation apparently the desk staff were unfamiliar with this type of card and how it works we had to pay in cash to keep our reservation i have been in touch with hotel management since the charges were still applied to my card and they are trying to resolve the issue right now it was still a stressful way to begin our vacation
