staff at the reception obviously rude especially the lady who ckecked us in named larissa she seemed so unhappy with her job frowning all the way we had to say hi before she even acknowledged us at check in when in fact there was no other guest at the time she sounded robotic and when i asked for wifi password and did not hear it at first she answered obviously irritated well almost angry we travelled all around the world and this kind of staff ruin your impression we stayed at nh berlin prior to our visit in amsterdam and had a great experience and hence decided to book this hotel same thing happened at check out you have to literally say hello to them before they acknowledge you not that we need attention we just need to check in and out one guy said to the other staff pointed at us they are checking out the service is so poor that even mcdonalds staff are far better on the other hand facilities and location are perfect flower market is literally outside the hotel hope the management do something about it at the end of the day it s your business just you ve got the wrong people for some key functioing role at front office they lack of motivation
