this room was the worst room that i have stayed in during my adult life it was so tiny that my husband and i had to turn sideways to go around the room and we are both thin the size would have been okay if the room had been clean and well maintained neither could be said in this case the shower drain was almost completely blocked the faucet leaked there was a bad odor etc i could go on and on i would never stay here again
