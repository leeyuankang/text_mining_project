my room was downgraded levels and i was not informed ahead of the day nor at the time of checking in after travelling and arriving past having notified the hotel this would be the case ahead of booking via booking com i was told that a change the room i had the reservation for would not be possible and they were fully booked despite my reservation to make matter worst they still wanted to charge me the price of the upgraded room claiming the price of the advanced booking on the better room was the same as the on the spot price of the downgraded room mind blowing unfair i know for the price they charge this service was not acceptable euro a night in the end the next day this was resolved through them charging me the price for the room i was slept in based on the price it was on the day i booked and reserved the better room i did not get to stay in the resolution via stan the manager great guy who understood and empathized with me stan is the only thing about this place
