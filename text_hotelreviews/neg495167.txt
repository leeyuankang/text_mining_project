we didn t have a great experience staying in this hotel before arriving when we needed some clarification we called up receptionist and she was very rude she told us you have done through booking com so you need to call them up we had requested for higher floor and better view we were given corner room when we requested them is it possible to change they said you have to pay more we received two single bed attached as double bed which was not at all comfortable we stayed for nights and days we din t have light above the mirror for two days due to weekend the toiletries coffee cups were not replenished each day all this discomfort was not even acknowledged by the staff
