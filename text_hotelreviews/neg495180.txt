arrived quite early about after traveling from the states although the room was available the policy is to charge an extra to check in needless to say this did not make me happy i travel often have never had this happen at various hotels throughout the world so we waited a few hours then was able to get into room at no charge i believe this is not good customer service if the room is available i understand if totally booked but this was not the case this was a waste of time when we could have been catching up on needed sleep room rug not so clean shower curtain too long excess hanging in the tub and although total charge close to for nites it didn t include breakfast the best part of this hotel is it s location also our room at nite had a lot of street noise
