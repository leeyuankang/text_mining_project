the first room we were given had a problem in that the window would burst open whenever the wind blew but staff were quick to upgrade us to a far better suite which we were very grateful of the hotel is in a really central location but it does mean it can be noisy from the street at night rooms are a little old fashioned and need spruced up but all in all it was a great place for a short weekend break
