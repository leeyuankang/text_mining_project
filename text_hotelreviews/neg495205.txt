only down side was the bed we have traveled quite a bit in hotels and b bs but never had a bed so uncomfortable i think they need to replace them we didnt get a good nights sleep while we were there and the carpet was well worn in room for a hotel of this rating i would expect a little bit more but other than that the staff were a delight and very helpful
