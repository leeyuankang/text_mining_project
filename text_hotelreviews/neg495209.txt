waited for minutes to check in and even longer to check out organised chaos on reception desk the central heating did not work in our room and although the maintenance man came straight away to review the problem he arrived armed with a portable heater he said it is an ongoing problem with the whole building it took a while to heat the room thankfully we were only in there to sleep so did not bother us too much the room was big enough for a weekend stay the bathroom was very small had to close the door to use the toilet towel rail was rusty feel it s slightly overpriced could do with an update
