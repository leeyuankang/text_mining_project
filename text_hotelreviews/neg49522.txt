street is a bit on the noisy side and a little difficult to find i was supposed to be in a superior room not sure if i was but it s a bit on the small side breakfast was ok but would be nice if they varied it a bit from day to day after a couple of mornings can t say i was looking too forward to eating the same things our room was on the side of the street and was noisy thru most of the night and early morning trash pickup was annoying would also be nice to have water in the room everything was charged from the minibar
