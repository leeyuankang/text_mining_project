we had an early flight and got to the hotel at our bags were locked away so we could explore we were told to come back at we came back later about and our room still wasn t ready and one member of staff said its not my fault the hotel is full not really what you want to hear when the staff had told you that maybe your room would be ready at but definitely at as per booking yet it was actually when we got in the room thankfully my partner asked for drinks while we waited and we got them free but not helped by the staff member however deserie sorted it again
