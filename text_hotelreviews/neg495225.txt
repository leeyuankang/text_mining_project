i felt the facilities inside the hotel were not the same as advertised on your site the ironing room for instance was a disgrace terribly small travel iron that didn t work properly was all that was offered even though it stated we could get an iron and ironing board in our room half the channels were missing on the tv also no mention of jacuzzi or massage facilities which were also mentioned on your site
