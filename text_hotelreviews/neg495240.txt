housekeeping was not great my daughters room was not serviced at all one day and small things like a pillowcase was just left lying in the basin in my room the one day attention to detail in cleaning could have been better nothing serious though thought euro deposit per room for mini bar was also a bit steep especially when they had my credit card details as security anyway breakfast very expensive we chose to eat elsewhere
