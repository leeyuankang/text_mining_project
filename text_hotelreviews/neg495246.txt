the hotel is very tired and scruffy and in desperate need of a makeover the carpet in the room was revolting stained to the point we nearly asked to move rooms as was new year we knew there was no point the curtains were the same they need replacing with new as does the carpet the bathroom was also just grubby the room was freezing and we had to request additional blankets we will not be staying again
