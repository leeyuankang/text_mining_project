the rooms are small old and not designed well bathtub is small carpets are very old and moldy prior to our departure from the hotel i ve requested the staff to call us a cab since we were supposed to leave at to a train leaving at from the central station before going to sleep i ve verified that the cab will be on time and gone to sleep at we came to checkout we ve waited until and the cab didn t arrive since we had only minutes left to get to the station we got outside and luckily got one from the street would never have guessed this is the level of a star hotel or maybe even would suite it better
