the room was very tired with damaged and dirty furniture floor and bathroom which did not look as if it was cleaned when we arrived there was blood stain on my wife s pillow and yellow crusty stuff on mine so i turned the slips inside out also the bed was so hard it cut off circulation down my legs and i did not sleep well at all any night on check in we waited in line for others to finish then when it was out turn someone just pushed in from the side and instead of asking them to wait they got served in front of us while we were at the counter no apologies were given the main door was not working for two days and the only in and out was through the small side emergency entrance and people would just stand around the door making it hard to go in or out i can t comment on the rest of the hotel as i only used the room and it was not by any level a star we stay in or star when traveling and this would be pushing it to get a star the overall experience was not good and i would not stay there again when we go back
