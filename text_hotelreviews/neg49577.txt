disappointed with booking com the room was cheaper on another site also despite stating that no money would be taken from my account to pay the hotel directly which i did on arrival however money was blocked as pending transaction held for one week which was very inconvenient as i was traveling overseas and in effect had paid twice as funds were not released for a week hotel staff my bank tried to assist without success
