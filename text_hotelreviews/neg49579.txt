housekeeping did not do a good job few times we had to ask them to refill our coffee and sugar a drawer keep falling off we told the reception about this already they fixed it but fell off again we stayed in a junior suite the room was smaller then our expectation but interior was nice my mom stayed in a regular deluxe room and it was very small but well sufficient
