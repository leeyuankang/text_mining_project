the restaurant downstairs is a more than a little disorganized my first day there i was seated and no one ever came to wait on me after minutes i had to ask for help then no one really gave me a run down of how breakfast works the day i was there i got seated and again it took a long time to get someone to pay attention to me and then it was oh you can go up to the buffet any time you want but i also wanted to order from the menu i also watched the same thing happen to several other families couples that were seated my tip here to the managers train your staff to give a little introductory about how the breakfast setup works that s what they do at every other hotel i ve stayed at in europe that serves breakfast
