this is really not suitable for business trip as the rooms are very loud and i couldn t sleep the whole night the bed was not comfortable even though i had a room on the floor the windows were small that made the room quite depressing to stay in check in took too long the hotel restaurant seems really good but not appropriate for room service unless you are in the mood for or course surprise menu
