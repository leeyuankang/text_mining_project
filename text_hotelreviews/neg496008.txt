the room it was tiny we stayed for three nights and struggled to get much sleep we had a mixture of hot and rainy weather there was no air conditioning so to keep cool it required either using a very loud fan or opening the windows which only opened very slightly and looked onto the wall of a neighbouring building this resulted in external noise not from the bustling city but from the broken gutter outside of the room which was even louder when raining we notified reception who were fully aware of this problem but could do nothing about it the pillows were the sixe of approximately three standard pillows bundled together reception advised that they were the only ones they had so i had to sleep with no pillow the toiletries and bottled water are not refilled daily when housekeeping come although we did receive toiletries refills when we requested them we were on the fifth floor of and there was only one single lift which we had to wait for a lot especially in the mornings when housekeeping were doing the rounds the room key card was very temperamental which meant regular trips up and down to reception waiting for the lift to get it fixed when it didn t work i also think the hotel description was misleading the airport shuttle service was a paid shuttle service which it transpired was only marginally cheaper than a taxi for two rather than and took much longer due to dropping off other passengers also there was no bike rental service as promised this service included giving us a business card for a local bike hire company where we had to pay their standard rates i would not return to this hotel despite the location
