superior room is facing the street which was very noisy at night party people screaming and cars honking the horn all the time couldnt t sleep until about am when things started to cool down and still i had earplugs if they could fix better insulated windows this would probably do the job tip try to get a room not facing the street hotel is very expensive and yet just normal standard on the other hand other hotels seem just as expensive in amsterdam
