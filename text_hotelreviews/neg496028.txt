on arrival the hotel had already taken one nights payment for each of rooms i d booked i assumed this would be taken off the full cost but i was told by a rude and unhelpful receptionist this was not he case so despite having already paid i was expected to still pay the full amount and the would be refunded although she had no idea when and there was no one there who would know days later i am still waiting for this refund an unexpected extra expense on my arrival
