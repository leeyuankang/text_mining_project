the overnight staff one lay wasn t friendly i arrived early around and my room was not ready she said housekeeping gets there at and will start preparing the room i waited till then she tells me they won t get there till and will take some time preparing the room meaning wait another hour and a half for the room mind you i had come from a hour flight she never apologized for the inconvenience or said sorry she had a straight face the whole time more like take it or leave it attitude when i said i will look for another hotel and not going to wait any longer then she decided to offer me a room in the basement i was exhausted so i took it it was noisy close to a storage room i could hear doors banging and people moving the whole time needless to say im not staying there again in all fairness the lady in the night shift was super nice and sweet
