we checked in quite late at night and if i m being honest i was expecting a warmer welcome the staff seemed to be more concerned about payment rather than giving us details about the hotel or location when we got to our room we could hear the extractor fan was still running and as two quite tired people we were hoping to get a decent sleep for a few hours unfortunately the noise continued and it was only after midnight that the noise stopped on my booking i specifically asked for a quiet room and was a bit surprised to have been given this we were on the fifth floor at the back of the hotel with views looking onto inner buildings just before midnight i called reception to enquire if the extractor noise would continue throughout the night and despite trying three times to call nobody answered luckily the noise soon stopped but it still made quite a restless night to begin with which was most unfortunate we had been travelling after a late journey and needed to be up the next morning so having a good sleep was a priority in terms of the room i was a little disappointed at there being an empty mini bar i expected there to be at least a few soft drinks available also i struggled with getting light switches to work properly it was more of a process of elimination to get the main lights switched off and the bedside lights to work i found the bathroom and bath shower especially to be a bit small this didn t bother me much however my boyfriend who is over struggled to shower comfortably finally i think there is a lack of communication from the hotel via booking com i sent over a couple of queries and didn t receive a clear response to any which was a bit of a shame overall i would say the hotel s strengths are the location helpful staff and classic charm the negatives lie with the old style building which i know can t be helped but i was disappointed after requesting a quiet room to end up in a rather noisy
