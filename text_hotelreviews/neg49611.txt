there is a noise coming from the kitchen from am till and you can hear it from the rooms that have their windows inside the property even though they ve put two ranges of double windows you silll hear it tghe hotel was not fully booked so we could get another room with an overview on the street much better however whatever the room you can t open the windows and hence not get any fresh air inside which is a pity
