a pair of my earrings went missing from my room which i had left on the desk the hotel manager would not do anything in terms of helping and didnt speak to the staff properly she promised me a new pair which she then changed her mind about she said different things to me everyday apparently the cleaning lady was new and even though it might have been an accident that she threw them away anything the guest leaves on the table should not be touched there was also no safe in the room the fridge didnt work either and the sink in the bathroom kept getting blocked the floor was dusty as well we pointed this out to the manager but again nothing was being done i paid a lot of money for this hotel and i lost a pair of nice earrings
