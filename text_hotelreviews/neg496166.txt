the only thing we thought was funny my daughter and i laughed was that there was a glass door to the bathroom and also a glass door to the shower so just hope you are close knit family when you stay the walls seemed thin we could hear water in the pipes randomly but we still slept great and didn t really bother us hardly any noise from other guests or voices so maybe just water pipes
