i was utterly disappointed at the lack of staffing i sat for over an hour in the sunny garden terrace and couldn t find a single member of staff at the bar at any stage to buy a drink i was in town on business with periods of time between meetings and i picked this hotel for it s convenient location and nice outdoors area thinking i could relax here in the end i gave up waiting for anyone to materialise and went to my room to order room service thinking this would be quicker the waitress who delivered my food was lovely but my meal came wrong by this time i was so hungry i accepted it the lack of staff happened again the next day
