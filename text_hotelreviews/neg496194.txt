the beds were too small and no extra blankets the towels were very old and well worn but were clean very few electric plugs for charging appliances need more info in room about surrounding area but guess that there is plenty of info in reception breakfast was until wow but we arrived at and food was used up and not replaced so be aware the nicer bread ran out and the eggs too and it would have been good to have been offered low fat fresh milk
