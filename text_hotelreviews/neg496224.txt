there wasn t a lot to dislike but we didn t use the restaurant it didn t look at all inviting and when we did go down to see what was there which we did a couple of times there was never any staff no one to welcome us or to tell us what was available how to order etc so we always ate out but it would have been nice to have had the odd coffee or lunch etc also i felt the price we paid was a little high for the size of room
