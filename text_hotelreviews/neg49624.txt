the front desk staff was not friendly at all booked a double room the room was too small even to fit a double bed the bed was pushed to the wall no lamp table nothing to place your alarm of any kind or socket to charge your mobile basically was pushed to the cold wall and had to jump off the bed from the other side not convenient at all the airconditioning was terrible and noisy when i complained to the frontdesk he basically told me this is a machine and it is like that i had to call house keeping three times to service the room as when i returned to the room mid day it was untouched although the sign was already on the door
