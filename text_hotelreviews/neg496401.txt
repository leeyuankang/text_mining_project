a few odd things like no main light in the room just lamps by the side of the bed no toilet brush only one garbage can in the bathroom none in the room the shower was only either warm or very hot not fun on a hot july day no electric sockets by the bed glass door on the bathroom that doesn t lock so it doesn t feel private
