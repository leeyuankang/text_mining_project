the hotel is a bit outdated the fitness center would need more space and newer machines the staff is nice but not very experienced left the laundry at the reception and they forgot to tell me that there was no laundry that day and they return my clothes at check out the day after i dropped them off dirty a message in the room would have been a nice touch
