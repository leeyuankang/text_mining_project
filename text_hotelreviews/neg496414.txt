first room was designed by a blind man nowhere to move put anything down ridiculous we changed rooms desk was very nice second room better but still weird sink so shallow water splashed everywhere no outlet by bed shower handle came off in my hand etc worst was breakfast coffee from a machine that belongs in an office super slow and tiny quantities a line developed quickly we actually skipped breakfast and went out instead
