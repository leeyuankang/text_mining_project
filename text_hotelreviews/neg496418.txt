awful breakfast even when you come on time not like min before closing food looks like leftovers not a big choice need to put toast through times to have it nicely done good thing it wasn t busy when we stayed swimming pool is like a puddle just over my knees so don t get too excited about good swim in there but good for kids swimming pool area was nice again just cos it was quiet as it s really small parking just like everywhere in barcelona expensive per night and you can take it in and out any time without extra charge which was good other carparks will charge you for hours you re actually parked and tiny if you are renting a car be careful not to damage the car in their carpark back and forth to park and to get out of it thin walls you can hear your neighbors especially their arguments in the middle of the night
