i felt like in a labyrinth having one of the rooms far away from the elevators and having to bend times around the corner to find my way out i was given a storey room for people which felt a bit weird being there completely alone the view outside my window was not only an inner yard it was blank concrete and no view at all but i got the room for a very good rate so i guess this is what you get when you pay an extra good price i am sure they have nicer rooms and for a family of accommodation would have been great despite no view so if i come back with the family i for sure will ask for this explicit type of room
