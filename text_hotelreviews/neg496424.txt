this hotel is situated in an excellent location and the staff are lovely however it is not a star hotel and it is expensive for what it is the facilities are very dated in particular the bed and pillows are extremely uncomfortable the mini bar fridge is very hot does not chill the contents at all and is not properly installed so it comes out of the cupboard when you open the door the air conditioning unit is so noisy that it would be impossible to sleep with it on luckily i had earplugs the wardrobe door was broken the furniture is very dated if you want a basic hotel that is in a good location the acevi is great however don t be fooled it is not a star hotel
