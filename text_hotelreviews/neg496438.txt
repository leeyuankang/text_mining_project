the first room we were given was awful needed doing up and was smelling of smoke but once explained to staff we were moved to a much nicer room the room was a bit too hot and the air on was not going cold and as we we re on the road we couldn t really leave open the window as it was soo noisy maybe the temperature could be looked at it didn t stop us enjoying our stay still had an amazing trip
