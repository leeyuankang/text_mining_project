the pool was closed not something that was clearly stated in our booking we chose this hotel for its spa and welness facilities but without a pool at its additional cost of euros per day it was not worth it the shower head holder was broken but was fixed as soon as we reported it walls are like paper so if you are hoping for a sleep in you won t get it here staff walking the halls sound like they are in your room air conditioning was very loud and uncomfortable we didn t eat in the restaurant menu wasn t to our liking
