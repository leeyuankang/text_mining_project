room layout is peculiar when the shower is used the entire room smells like mold the room needs better ventilation also the decor needs fixing updating the bed slides from the wall while you are on it i informed a desk employee twice that one of the bedside lamps cord was frayed and that the lamp was sparking and asked that it be removed or replaced this was never done more attention to detail would improve service
