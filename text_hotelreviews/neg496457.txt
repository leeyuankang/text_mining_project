i was shocked the last time i was there by the attitude of some of the staff in particular in the bar restaurant extremely rude over a bucket of ice i have stayed so many times there but for the first time i was asked to pay for ice but then that was not the problem but it was for the attitude of the bartender i dont think i will return there
