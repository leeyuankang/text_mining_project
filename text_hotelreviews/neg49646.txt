we were very disappointed by the hotel bar and its staff we returned to the hotel at on saturday evening to have a drink in the hotel bar we were told at this time that it was last orders when booking the hotel we noted that the bar was open until m on their website when we asked reception they told us that the bar was operated separately and sometimes closed early when it was quiet they must have turned people away and refused to serve people a second drink we only got a second one when we complained this was extremely disappointing to us
