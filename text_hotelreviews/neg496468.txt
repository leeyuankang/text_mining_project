no complimentary water provided small bottles of water below are euros each we tried to visit the spa and we didn t have the best experience the card key provided for entry to the spa didn t work so i had to go back and forth to the reception twice in my spa attire no comfortable for a lady when we entered it had been left in a state by what i could only guess was another couple they d left bottles and champagne flutes everywhere and no staff had come to tidy up i presume the refreshments were acquired through the hotel so why not clean up there were no towels in the spa when i asked at reception for towels to be provided i was told i could only have even though i needed one for my hair and body room service on the night we ordered room service i ordered steak topped with fois gras but there was no fois gras on the dish and no discount was offered for a substandard meal our dirty dishes were moved outside our room by the maids the following day but the tray remained for days without anyone collecting it i have photos as evidence there was a sign in the bathroom stating if you need anything like cotton wool or a sewing kit etc then to ask at reception i did this and there was nothing available apart from some tissues this doesn t reflect the standard of a star hotel and i plan to write a letter of complaint this room costed over euros and nights this hotel is not good value for money
