this hotel is functional at best the towels were threadbare they even had holes in they d been cleaned so many times the fridges in the rooms we had connecting rooms both fridges ineffective were effectively heating the contents useless breakfast was pretty basic but ok but a single coffee machine was pretty bad and there was always a queue on the first night i asked for a glass of wine at the bar and was told all the house wine was finished so i d have to buy a bottle at nearly per room night it s expensive for what it is if you are looking for a special experience i wouldn t recommend this hotel
