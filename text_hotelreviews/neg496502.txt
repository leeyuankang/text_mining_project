stayed in the junior suite which was a mistake the dvd only worked in the saloon not in the bedroom and the only thing to relax on in the saloon were small not very comfortable armchairs no sofa on top of that the shower door wouldn t close properly and as we were only staying one night it couldn t get fixed in time the compensation for this was bottles of water from the mini bar in general the room could use a bit of maintenance some lights were broken the bath robes had holes in them etc i m sure the hotel is ok if you just look for a place to sleep rather than actually spend some time at the hotel and if you re in a normal room rather than paying for a suite with money that could give you a much better hotel in barcelona
