there were two complaints from us the first night we arrived late in the evening and asked the staff about a place to dine nearby the guy pointed to the one that they advertise which was far far away from the hotel we walked for mins with a toddler but still weren t even close the that place so we settled for one of the many places along the route the strange thing is that there were other streets with other options he could have pointed us to and save us time and effort the air conditioning did not work properly even if set to max cold it was blowing slightly warm air when we called the reception they changed something but the issue then was that even when set to max heat it was blowing cold air all through our stay we had to call them to times just to get the ac adjusted then why have the dials in the room at all
