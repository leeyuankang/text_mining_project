the beds were extremely uncomfortable we were in room and the beds were some of the worst i ve ever known did not have one night of good sleep because of this there was a constant smell coming from the sink there was wood missing from the floor by the bathroom door the shower leaked into the bathroom floor every time it was used i asked about using the gym one evening as i d seen a poster in the lift saying the spa was free and the guy on reception was really rude and dismissive saying the poster goes on to explain this is only for people booking direct on their own website he didn t even offer use of the gym for a price the cost of water from the minibar was crazy go over the road and buy it
