i was there on business and only upon arriving was i told that there was no business centre on each floor as advertised not impressed they were not willing to let me use their computers and i had to pay out of pocket to get important work done elsewhere additionally we are a non smoking family with two young children who booked the family suite which very nice unfortunately we were told this was a non smoking facility and nowhere on your booking form does it say this is a smoking facility well apparently they do allow smoking on the first floor which passed through the ventilation system and made all four of us quite nauseous and ill interestingly they said it was a ventilation issue but there was no smoke noted whatsoever in the main lobby if i would have known these issues beforehand i would have selected another hotel
