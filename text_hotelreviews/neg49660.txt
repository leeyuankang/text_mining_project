the tv reception was awful and when we complained we were told they are all like that worse was that they made no offering or consideration to appease the problem we stayed nights on full rate and so a little customer service to apologise for the problem and showing some form of refund or compensation would have gone a long way instead we had to have an argument with them at check out for the sake of their lack of customer service on this issue we will boycott this hotel in the future
