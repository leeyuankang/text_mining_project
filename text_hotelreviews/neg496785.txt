everything was going well was really proud of the choice i made and was ready to recommend this hotel and give it a nice review until i got to the reception desk to check out here s what happened when i booked i opted that i payed at the reception desk on arrival it explicitly stated that i am not required to make any payment in advance this option was more expansive than paying in advance immediately after the booking was completed i received notification from my bank that my account was debited with the whole amount that i should have payed on arrival i contacted the property and they said that this is a just a way to guarantee my reservation and that this transaction will not be completed and the money will be released after i made the payment at the reception desk so i got to the hotel and at check in i they required to block another euros from my bank account as deposit instead of blocking another they blocked the whole amount that they ve already blocked when i made the reservation euros that was kind of awkward but i just wanted to enjoy my holiday and did what they required now the real shock was when i wanted to check out they said that i have to pay for my stay i said that i have to transactions pending with them and they can just complete one of them and take the money from there but no they wanted to do another transaction on the account that the two transactions will be released and the money will return to my bank account so in order to pay x amount for my stay they charged times that amount from my bank account the first two transactions were released several days after i left days to be exact so during my holidays i had money blocked on my bank account money i couldn t use
