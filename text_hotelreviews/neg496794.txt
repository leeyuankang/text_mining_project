bed was rather small and way too soft which mad it not comfortable small room is super small sufficient for night stay during summer when you are out all the time anyway but very claustrophobic inside crazy expensive and we had scaffolding outside our window with workers making noise not something we were informed to expect for a night in small room that s rather shocking no breakfast included and very expensive to buy staircase to our room was more like a ladder fine for us although it would be close to impossible if we had any bigger luggage than our small bags can t imagine any older or larger people being able to climb it staff misplaced our luggage and we wasted time waiting for it to be found without much of an apology nor any compensation for stress and inconvenience it s a nice hotel and normal rooms looked lovely but the price is just ridiculous and we hadn t have good experience with staff so definitely won t be coming back
