when we arrived there was scaffolding outside not ideal but not really a problem what was a problem is that we were told to go out floor and when the lift opened i honestly thought we had gone to the basement by mistake work men s shoes all over tins of paint stepping over debris on our way to the room was not ideal maybe if we d had an indicator this would have helped it was pretty shocking
