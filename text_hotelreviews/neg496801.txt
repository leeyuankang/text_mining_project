we visited the hotel as a group to celebrate my husbands birthday when we arrived we were given our room keys and made our way to the basement to where our rooms were as we descended the stairs the smell of paint was very obvious however there were no signs to suggest decorating was taking place to get to our rooms we had to step over paint trays full of paint and to my annoyance when i entered my room i realised i had got paint on my new shoes and all up my trousers the following morning painting commenced outside our bedroom at waking us all up and to gain access back to reception we once again had to complete an obstacle course to exit i took photos and showed them to the management who at the time did not say much when i checked out they had reduced my room rate however not the other two rooms in my party who had encountered the same experience and did not offer to replace my now ruined new shoes or trousers very disappointed for the price we paid
