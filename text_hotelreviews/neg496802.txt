this is the time we have stayed at the vondel and every time we have booked a twin room when we go to check in they never seem to be aware of this and we have to wait whilst they prepare our room our free time in amsterdam is very limited so this is always disappointing on the good side they do provide a complementary drink in the bar whilst we wait and we will definitely be staying at the vondel again
