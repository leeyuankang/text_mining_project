even though i ve asked for room in upper floor we got room that literally located at basement under the ground with scary steps in entry the ceiling is very low and you hear all the movement in the sidewalk that is just outside the window uncomfortable feeling moreover we had a leak in the shower the sealing between the shower and the bathroom wasn t good and all the bathroom were flooded with water after a short shower although the room is renovated the level of the facilities isn t high
