dont be fooled by the pay at the hotel advertising the hotel policy for taking numerous deposits on credit cards is really confusing i payed initial deposits for each room a week before arrival then the same deposits on the first night then paid in full on the last day meaning the hotel held over on our cards combined leaving some of our group short of spending money if we had known we would of stayed elsewhere
