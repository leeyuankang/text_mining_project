steep stairs led up to our room but the staff only thought to offer us help after we had carried our bags up the first flight we knew the room would be small but we were surprised to also find it overfurnished the bathroom was poorly ventilated and the windows could only be opened half way hitting the bed and blocking passage the bed was short and the pillows very long and shapeless the wifi was so slow it was essentially unusable both from our room and even from the lobby during our evening drink in the bar we were accompanied by two mice running around on the floor
