received email asking if i would like to upgrade from a basement room to a suite to which i replied yes and after confusion on arrival when the lady at reception had to check with her manager and show her the email i was told there were no suites and the email was just to confirm if i d like an upgrade if one was available the confusion suggested to me that they made this up there and then to cover for the fact they d messed up this was unfortunate as the basement room was right next to a stair case which was very loud and had windows to street level that were also very loud
