the front desk manager had an attitude and was very rude the room smelled of food and there was no electricity and when we asked for the room to be changed she said no we will send maintenance and was on the phone when i went to speak to her and ignored me other than that incident with her i was happy with the hotel and adrien was helpful and changed our room not even an upgrade or an apology from her
