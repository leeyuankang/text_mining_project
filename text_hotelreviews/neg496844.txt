we were put in a twin room and not a double although they did come and lay one sheet over the beds for us on our first stay we were given bath robes and slippers on our first night however on this occasion we were told there were none available we were told this twice by the same receptionist i thought something was awry i waited until there was a new receptionist and was promptly handed fresh robes and and slippers was there some kind of personal vendetta the receptionists had against us the mind boggles anyway it was an alright stay but the slipper and robe debacle did take up a lot of my time
