the hotel is very noisy so is very hard to sleep at night because you can hear all the voices the steps etc of the other costumers the bed is extra small for two people they say it is a queen bed but was very very small the room was very small as well somehow not expected from a stars hotel double room light was coming in the morning from the window and was impossible to completely cover it with the curtains
