the minibar fridge was not fully working and water pooled inside there were mosquitos in my room which bit me on several nights despite my best efforts to kill them all the previous guest had clearly done the same as their bloody dead squashed bodies were all over the ceiling and walls though this was disgusting and unsightly the maid never cleaned them away i was there for nights on check out the receptionist offered to ignore my minibar bill as compensation i explained that my employer would pay for that so it was of no compensation to me she then said she would get her manager to ring me the following day i m still waiting there were cobwebs in the bathroom above head height which were never cleaned the pillows were huge but provided no comfort or support it all just felt grubby and tired
