the place was extremely over priced for what we received we were put in a room located in the basement of the hotel that smelled like mold sewage the room was extremely small and was covered in mosquitos dead mosquitos on the walls the staff offered to spray the room while we were out but left the dead bugs on the wall it was ridiculous for what we were paying i would never stay at this hotel again i am sure the rooms on the higher floors are better but if you are going to stay here i would recommend calling ahead to makes sure you are not put in the basement
