to begin with i fail to understand how a star hotel could possibly have a basement room the next day when i was moved up and for which i had to pay extra they moved me into a tiny room i couldn t sleep properly for the two nights i was there there was so much sound coming into my room that i could hear the people from upstairs from the next room and even footsteps i woke up times in the middle of the night thinking someone had entered my room because someone else across the hall was entering their room the tv was from i don t know what century with maybe like channels and only two in english one of the staff was a helpful girl apart from her they were all a little stuck up and when i asked to change my room from basement they told me i had booked that room again i can t fathom a star hotel with rooms in basement i m sorry but it was a very bad experience the breakfast was very ordinary the rates are too high for the quality and service being provided no one even bothered helping me with my luggage on my way out worst decision i made during my day trip around europe
