on the first night we wanna take a bath in the jacuzzi when i turned the water on i found there s a lot of black dust in the water and i found out it was from the bathtub looks like it haven t used and cleaned for a while so at last i need to clean the tub myself before using it the second night the hot water pipe in our building was broken so we only took a quick cold shower that night and it s still broken until late evening of the next day during the checking in period pm on saturday there s only one person at the check in counter the couple on the line before me waited for about mins to only get their luggages in the baggage room we waited for about mins only to ask for a taxi to the airport we tried to use uber but it doesn t work somehow anyway the girl at the front desk was very nice and in the good mood all the time and tried to serve everyone at her best i suppose it just a hotel system that s not right how can you arrange only one person at the front desk around the check in time and even on staurday
