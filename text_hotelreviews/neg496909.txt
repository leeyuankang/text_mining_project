the room i booked was but the one i got was not more then or the shower is so low because it s made under a staircase that i couldn t shower standing straight the room wasn t clean under the bed there where dirty tissues and at the desk or next to the bed there is no plug to charge a phone or laptop the room has a connecting door and when the vacuum the room next door at in the morning it wakes you up when i wanted to check out it took minutes before someone extra came the other person was helping an other guest and they didn t even call someone it s a nice hotel but my previous experiences have been way better last time i stayed here
