the hotel decided to block money in our bank account even though we suggested to leave a cash deposit instead further more they blocked more then they proclaimed to block so we had to argue with them until they saw that we were right and changed the amount blocked who heard of such a thing leave my bank account alone and that block wasn t released even after we checked out and got back home only after an angry email to the hotel they apologized and removed the block this hotel doesn t worth the headache it gave me
