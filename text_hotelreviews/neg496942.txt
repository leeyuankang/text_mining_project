on arrival was kept waiting for minutes due to the receptionist kept answering calls the staff should be trained how to prioritise tasks the room itself is very small and it s very difficult to even walk around the bed without knocking into something the decor is rather old and overall i will not call this hotel a boutique hotel as they advertised
