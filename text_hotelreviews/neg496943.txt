breakfast was slightly chaotic with too few staff trying to cope with food and crockery running out and one coffee machine simply isn t enough there was an a la carte breakfast menu but it wasn t clear how to order staff didn t come to offer to take an order and when a poached egg arrive it was cold and hard on another day the pancake wasn t great the bathroom was very elegant but with a very shallow sink it was almost impossible to fill the otherwise excellent large kettle to make tea
