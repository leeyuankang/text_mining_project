took the souterraine room against some of the advises from previous reviewers regretted as the room was really next to the walkway noise wasn t that bad it came mostly from the lift and the staircase that is right next to the room almost everyone who stayed on our level use that staircase the lift would have taken too long imagine the number of footsteps stomping up and down not sure if book months in advance to get a good rate have landed us in less than desirable rooms strong recognizable sticky sweet smell coming into the bathroom from the central ventilation system at first we thought it was from the previous occupant then we realise it s gone by day and it only happens at night every night
