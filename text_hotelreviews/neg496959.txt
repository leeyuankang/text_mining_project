hotel blocked money on my card almost a week ahead and when we arrived they asked for returnable charge in case of taking something from minibar when we were checking out we got back and paid for the room by card few hours later i ve got an email from the hotel that they need other card information because transaction didn t go through of course it didn t go through because they didn t unblock the amount and were trying to charge me again fortunately it all solved out
