we were initially put in the wrong room which was on the bottom floor next to the road i told the night porter who checked us in that it wasn t the room we had booked and that it was really noisy to which he replied it s in the city centre what did you expect he then went on to try to convince me just to take the room he had put us in thankfully it got sorted the next day and the manager moved us to the room that we had paid for although they did initially try to make me pay extra to move rooms
