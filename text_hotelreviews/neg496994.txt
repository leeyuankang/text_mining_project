the location of the hotel has an inconvenience you are expose to the air traffic and it s difficult to not get awakened by the noise of the landings of airplanes our room was just above the restaurant and we could hear every single noise from there even the tinkling of glass my partner and i had a very noisy experience there but it might be different depending on the room you book
