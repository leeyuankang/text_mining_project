when i checked in i was proposed an upgraded room for free that is wider and with a nice view i accepted and thanked but i got a decently spaced room with windows buried by an opposite wall roof no view at all furthermore the furniture was cheap and worn out in the bathroom just very ordinary shower gel shampoo and shower cap were provided the elevator got stuck between floors several times personnel was essential not caring about and loudly speaking definitely a quality level largely below stars
