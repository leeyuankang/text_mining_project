the hotel itself was lovely and in a prime position however we were in room which seems to be directly under the bar upstairs and the noise from people talking and walking on the wooden floor was a complete nightmare ended up only getting about three to four hours sleep per night so would not return purely for this reason as we were woken at every morning by people walking and chairs getting dragged along was not a happy bunny
