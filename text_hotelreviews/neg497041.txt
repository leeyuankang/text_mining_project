my husband and i booked an executive double room for ourselves and double rooms for the children we were disappointed that the double rooms we ordered for the children were in the basement and very noisy in fact both rooms had to be changed after the first night due to silverfish in the rooms and a great deal of noise from restaurant above our executive room was a huge disappointment as we expected a seating area which turned out to be two small chairs in the corner of the room but nothing near what i would class as executive the room was also small with two single mattresses pushed together and single bedding ie single duvets and sheets free wifi was the worst i have ever used and i stay in many hotels thank goodness i wasn t staying on business because the wifi constantly kicked you out this happened to everyone in our party of
