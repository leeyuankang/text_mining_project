breakfast was a highlight on previous visits but not this time the food was fine but while the staff are clearly working hard there is a sense of chaos in the dining room language barriers are evident and guests were struggling to be understood i asked for a soft boiled egg and was taken to the hard boiled cold eggs to be told they were soft i tried twice then gave up a choice of lighter egg dishes for people who prefer light options would have been appreciated i think some support for this staff team is needed they were trying so hard and looked so stressed
