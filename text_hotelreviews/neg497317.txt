i couldn t pay with my maestro card although i had already asked through mail whether it s acceptable or not and certainly got yes from the hotel before coming the man at the reception desk at that moment pretended to try my card on the machine and just got it back to me requiring cash or other cards i have no idea why it was then acceptable on the day of checking out to pay for other service fees at the first day of my stay i was shocked at the taste of cappuccino in the breakfast buffet and then realized its milk had gone bad too bad that i and my mother suffered from stomachache right from that day on plus i booked this hotel mostly because i saw several positive reviews on the breakfast buffet but well then i should say that it was way lower than expected especially as a star hotel i used eurail pass throughout my stay in vienna but unfortunately this hotel is reachable by u bahn kaiserm hlen vic is the name of the closest station which is not covered by the pass in short we need to buy the ticket to take the metro and it costs per person for one way
