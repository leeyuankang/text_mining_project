don t take restaurant advice from staff one of the nearby restaurants they recommended was abysmal the gym does not open till maybe am apparently the gym equipment made a lot of noise which would disturb those sleeping and so i couldn t use it needed to leave early my wife who used the gym said it was very basic and poorly equipped the reason why we stayed here was proximity to the conference centre while that s true next time i ll stay in the city centre and take the train to the conference centre train stops right outside the conference centre
