this hotel deserves stars at its best not worth the over per night very boring and worn out no services just a room and a bed the gym was smaller than my room i saw only staff members non were enthusiastic to serve i have had good experience with the radisson chain before but this one was a total abuse of the brand my first room had such a poor sound insulation i could hear every word whispered next door and also their alarm clock every morning at o clock i chose this hotel for its proximity to vienna international centre but the centre is just outside the u bahn station and its much easier and better to stay in the city and take the train as walking from this hotel takes you minutes anyway will never go back
