the pillows were not very comfortable the fact that room service and food was not available beyond breakfast was very inconvenient as i had to make sure to buy something to take back for dinner also the variety for breakfast could have been more in terms of the typical viennese sweets for example and more homemade cakes some varieties seemed to be packaged and bought from a shop such as the swiss rolls the most important thing was that a friend of mine got a better deal for the same nights from another booking company a total of euros less and when she told me i tried to book the same way and found there were no more vacancies from that site and the hotel could not do anything about it
