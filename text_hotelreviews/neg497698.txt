the interior of the hotel is not worn but old fashioned rather style the restaurant is not very cosy one of the first evenings i forgot my book in the wellness area i went back the following day to the reception and was told that nobody from the housekeeping was there anymore and that i should return the next day i went back to the reception the next day the gentleman checked the computer and told me that nothing has been found i accepted but when i went back to the wellness there was another staff member who i asked about my book he was very kind and went to check after five minutes he was back with the book
