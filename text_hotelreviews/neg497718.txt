remember to specify a double bed i got two singles the breakfast buffet was very expensive so i ordered a small breakfast to my room for about half the price it seems to be a business hotel so probably a lot of people charge it to their business expenses i had difficulty opening the door to my room a maid showed me the trick which was to swipe the card and then turn the handle hard and push hard the card also deactivated the day before i left when i arrive back i m generally tired from walking around vienna and then i don t like having to return to reception
