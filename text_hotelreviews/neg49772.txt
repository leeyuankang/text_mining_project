noisy air condition not stoppable working all night windy and uncomfortable heating by ventilators we got really sick and we were leaving with a cold also the fitness center of the millennium hotel next door which you can use as bailey s guest is tiny the whole lobby in the millennium really stinks infernally of perfume aerosols you can even smell it from the streets so that we could not use the fitness center without getting sick with bronchitis also guests and employees were smoking in front of the hotel so that you had lots of second hand smoke like in whole london unfortunately and parking was very expensive gbp no public parking available nor affordable all in all the bailey s hotel itself would be a great hotel if air condition air and heating could be improved we recommend to implement a new own fitness room in the bailey s
