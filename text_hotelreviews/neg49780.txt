our first room was very small full sized bed shoved up against the wall could only get out on one side not good for two people but fortunately it also had a broken room safe and room phone they were able to fix the room safe after about minutes but the phone was going to require more work and checking the lines at that point i asked if we could switch rooms and we were put into a room that was slightly bigger allowing us each to have room to get in and out of the bed from either side all staff friendly and professional in resolving the issues beware though both my rooms were the same price level but were very different in terms of comfort
