the bailey s lounge was not quite what we were expecting for an executive lounge it was clean and comfortable and there was a nice variety of snacks and drinks available but we had imagined it was more like the kind of executive lounge you might find at a fairmont or intercontinental hotel where it is staffed and you can have evening drinks and canap s but that was not our experience here
