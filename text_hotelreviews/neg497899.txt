the breakfast was really meager very few option s and very little amounts of what was offered the towels where spotless clean but of a really cheap standard no air conditioning and we didn t get a fan until the sixth day of our stay although it was between degrees their was one nice member of staff but most weren t i wouldn t go back there and i certainly wouldn t recommend it my daughter stayed their for a month as she was on an elective and her room was awful she was told for the money she was paying that was the best room she could have she paid more than us and there were two of us it was all about the profit margin not about the customer overall we were all very disappointed
