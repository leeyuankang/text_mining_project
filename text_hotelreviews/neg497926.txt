i booked a suites room and a double room we asked to be connected because we have children of which one disabled of course we did not have rooms connected or the possibility to changing them at the reception they blamed the booking although i asked them in writing because i could not leave children alone i slept with the children in the suite and the husband alone the couch is terrible it s impossible to sleep on it you can not ask for a lot of money on a suite and offer a very incomfortable sleeping couch by far the biggest disappointment was the breakfast which even though it was free was not good for hotel claims and the parking there was no parking for the wheelchair and in the garage the car did not fit because the maximum was m at a hotel with such claims and prices i expect something else
