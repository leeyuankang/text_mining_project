no wardrobe in a suite nowhere to hang clothes at night pillows were so soft as to be useless even six were not enough always having to log into the internet even with a four day stay having to ask for the in room breakfast menu and one morning they forgot to pick it up lack of staff at the reception desk queues of five or even ten minutes the norm the doorstop conveniently placed to ensure excruciating toe stub almost every time we used the hooks that passed for the wardrobe single duvets for a double bed no security at the entrance to the hotel anyone could walk in off the street with or without a reservation even worse the so called executive floor could be accessed by anyone entering the lift our fault for not checking but anyone expecting enticing streets and cafes in the vicinity of this hotel will disappointed the surrounding architecture is mostly concrete blocks almost neo stalinist in design with the building itself fronting busy dual carriageways on two sides and a railway line nearby
