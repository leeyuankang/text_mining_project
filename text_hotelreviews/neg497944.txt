when i arrived at my next destination i realized that some items had been removed from my suitcase while i was away from the hotel dispite the fact that i had the do nodt disturb sign on my door for the dudration of my day stay i thought that perhaps i hadn t packed them however when i arrived home i realized that indeed the items that were brand new still in their packaging went missing unfortunately i have learned that all items need to be locked up whenever i leave the room
