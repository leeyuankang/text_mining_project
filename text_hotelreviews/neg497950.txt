i expected to be able to use the wellness and sport facilities however during to an even they closed it exactly during the whole length of my stay with no notice i saw it suddenly in the elevator written in small and between some other advertisement regarding the event which i was not interested so i really saw the notice by chance i think they should have given some discount as the facilities were not available and people could have then chosen another place to stay
