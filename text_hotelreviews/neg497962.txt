although we had prepaid the full amount to the hotel as soon as we got there we were asked to deposit another eur day for the extras we found this amount to be outrageous considering the cost of the hotel was eur day also even though our bed sheets were changed the staff forgot to change our pillow cases through out our stay furthermore we asked the hotel to bring us double bed coverings but they told us that it was not possible in addition the hotel needs to upgrade it s computers as we had a really hard time getting them to work
