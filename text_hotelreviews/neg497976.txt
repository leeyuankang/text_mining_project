i booked a double room and requested a quiet room but the first room that we were given was a twin room so we asked for a room change and were given a double room however this room was a quite noisy as it was in front of the elevators and also because there was a group of guests nearby who were noisy so we again asked for a room change and finally settled into a quiet double room the staff members were very nice but it d have been better if my requests were actually met from the beginning nonetheless i would highly recommend this hotel
