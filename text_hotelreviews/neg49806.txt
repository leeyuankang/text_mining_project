i booked through booking com and did not realize that breakfast was not included when i read through the small print i upgraded and requested breakfast i got an email asking if i was happy with the extra fee i said yes the message said the hotel would be informed i then rang the hotel to confirm booking and breakfast update i was told the message had been received and everything was confirmed when we went down for breakfast we were told we had not paid for breakfast i then had to have a long chat outside the restaurant with my husband sitting patiently outside this was my treat to my husband for our anniversary and it was very embarrassing to say the least eventually we were allowed to have breakfast but it had spoilt our morning i eventually spoke to reception who told me that yes they had received the information about breakfast and it was in small print not quite sure why that information was not passed to the restaurant considering i rang days before arrival to confirm that everything was okay
