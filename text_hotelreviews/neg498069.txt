we didn t understand the term privileged room we booked more expensive room because of the extra large double bed all the other options looked like there are two or more beds apart from each other in the room not clear on your website so for us as a couple this was the only option the bed was comfortable yes but also split in the middle so it didn t feel like something special we were told by check in that we had a privileged room and that meant wifi for free and free access to the mini bar wifi was super slow and in the mini bar there were waters coca cola and orange juice that was a bit funny i think the bar should have other options and maybe we should be told that we have non alcoholic drinks for free and the rest we pay that would be ok but to put there what was in there and not give another option while calling the room privileged was to laugh about so we called the reception and asked for two beers which we would pay we didn t have to pay but the beer arrived totally warm so we had to wait anyway till the next day so that it would cool in the fridge
