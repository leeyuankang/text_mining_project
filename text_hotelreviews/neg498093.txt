read about restaurant and bar available on site wasn t open at all during our stay read about air conditioning available in the rooms but when we got to our room and called reception about why the aircon wasn t working we were told that it was disconnected as they only make it available during summer months our bedroom was so hot we had to open windows during night which was really noisy from outside as they were working in the courtyard from early hours of the morning
