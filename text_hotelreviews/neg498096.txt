rooms are clean and nice enough location is pretty central very easy to get about using the metro air con tv and wifi did not work in our room on first night was absolutely roasting and we couldnt do some of the work we needed to do for our trip we got moved rooms but air con still did not work overall was not very happy with the whole experience
