issues with the hotel the rooms were too hot especially in the night there were some minor construction noises in the morning as some parts of the hotel were not ready yet e g restaurant parking i guess but we didn t mind because we had to be up relatively early and we didn t eat there vienna has so many options regarding breakfast lunch coffee etc just go out and explore the beautiful city the design of the rooms is very nice the only negative would be the design of the bathtub too tall and you have to be careful issues with the hotel staff minor issues didn t ruin our overall impression of the hotel for example two weeks before arrival i sent to the hotel the details for the invoice it was a business trip and i also gave them the required info upon arrival however when i checked out the receptionist issued an invoice to the wrong address he said he hadn t been informed about my request for a company invoice and i had to request a new one via e mail from the hotel manager because he said he couldn t change it nothing serious but they gave me the impression they are a bit disorganized in my opinion these minor issues could have been avoided if the hotel was opened a little later
