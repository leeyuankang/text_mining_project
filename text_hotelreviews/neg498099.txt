the male staff where just seemed apathetic since im a receptionist too in a star hotel i think that they have to be more helpful i asked him to make for me a dinner reservation and they told me that i can call from their phone on my own also for their info a smile to their guests is not a big deal overall i reccomend this property and maybe i would stay there again
