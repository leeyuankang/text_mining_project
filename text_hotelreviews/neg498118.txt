the staffs were friendly but was not efficient in solving real problems we were in a double room for three nights the bathroom door was broken cannot be closed before we moved in what make it worse there was a mirror on the wall outside the bathroom so you could see everything in the bathroom from the living room if the door cannot be closed we repeatedly reported this problem to the reception people every day but was never solved i understood that it was the holiday time therefore they do not have spare room for us to change though there were people check out everyday and the workers might have shorter working hours however the way they processed our problem is very disappointing we had to explain our issue everyday to different staff every time we come to the reception desk the earlier staff never pass the problem to the later staff none of them followed our issue neither did the same staff ever checked with us about the progress the expression they had when i repeated the problem made me feel that the door should definitely be fixed by itself i am even not sure whether they have sent any one to check on the door as there was no hint of fix again the staffs are friendly but not very efficient
