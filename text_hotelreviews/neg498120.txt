breakfast is a joke poor quality not worth the money you have restaurants near by heating not adjustable was a little chilly still looks like being under construction private parking means you have to park your car at a nearby away ibis hotel if you dare to park in front of or near the hotel you will get a fine or even your car will be towed although there is no sign warning you to purchase any parking ticket can only be bought from westbahnhof away this is a total rip off hotel staff does not warn you about this
