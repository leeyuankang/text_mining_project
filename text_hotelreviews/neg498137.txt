the bathroom is very small and not entirely renovated the wi fi has a very low signal the room has no espresso machine like other star hotel rooms do we had no mini bar in the room we also didn t have slippers in the room and had to ask for them there aren t any parking spaces in the area that you can use as most of them are reserved only for the residents and the disabled we parked on the street and hours later when we returned to the car we had a fine on the windscreen as we didn t know about the restrictions of the parking at first and the receptionist didn t warn us about them he simply said that we could park on the street and pay the public parking fees the room was not soundproof
