the service in the restaurant was very poor which is a shame as the food was very good they made a mistake in our main course by bringing the wrong order when we pointed this out we were dealt with gruffly with no apology when we tried to understand why the mistake was made the waiter could not understand our question so we just stopped it the end the delay caused us to miss the start of our show that we had booked i have no problem with someone making a mistake that happens all the time what we had an issue with was the poor way it was handled it really took the shine off of the night
