it s noticeable that rooms have seen better days we lived in a standard room but have also seen superior room which wasn t much better furniture needs to be renewed it has noticeable scratches bathtub didn t have a drain stopper so we could only use it as a shower we were told of a lower price when we decided to stay for more days during last day checkout we were charged much more and it took around minutes for me to handle this situation but we still were charged more than we were told earlier maybe because of misunderstanding or something
