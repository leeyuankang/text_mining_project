first impressions weren t good we had to struggle up the stairs and open the front doors with all our suitcases no doorman after checking in we then had to go through many fire doors and back down stairs with the same cases the room was musty and warm as if it hadn t been used in a while it was quite noisy from traffic the ac vent was facing a wall so not very effective we booked a luxury double room to get a large bed which was king size width but not king size length my husbands feet still hung over the edge only could fit in the bathroom at any one time the bed was very firm but ok the couch for two of us to sit on was metre wide room service lost our order the breakfast was ample but seemed to be very dated and not very appealing the staff were unable to tell us what the juices were
