some how reminded me of a bunker of sorts and you had better have a lot of nerve if you re going to use the underground parking my travelling companion was not willing to be in the vehicle when it was time to come out she still to this day can t imagine how i managed it without either hitting one of the walls and there was copious evidence of that having happened or pooping my pants so fine cheap parking elsewhere and get there by subway and on foot
