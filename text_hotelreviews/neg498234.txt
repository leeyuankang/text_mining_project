talk about all that glistens reception area been modernised and looks okay but the rest of the place is a disgrace the hallway carpets are filthy the walls marked inside and outside the rooms cheap furnishings and very tacky indeed the garden looks like it has been deserted and is really awful with weeds and old furniture abandoned very disappointing indeed the china in the breakfast room was chipped i have never seen this in a hotel before the little bucket on the table for waste was badly broken with a sharp and dangerous edge the coffee machine was on a couple of bits of wood and the worktop it stood on had lost its edge so looks awful
