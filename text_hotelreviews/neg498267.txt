the worst thing was the bathroom light switch which was outside the bathroom so when one occupant uses the bathroom which is right opposite the bed the other occupant gets disturbed if the bathroom and the bed were not opposite each other it would not be so bad we had an attic room the other rooms might be different it was hard to keep the rooom door open as we entered with all our luggage the carpets especially in the corridors looked dirty the carpets in the entire hotel can do with some cleaning the wifi was not that good
