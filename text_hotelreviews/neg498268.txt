i think that it does not merit star i think it should just be star the bathroom was not lighted well and was dark were the shower was aside from which there is no shower closure so the water tends to splash out we borrowed some coffee mugs we used it and when we arrived that evening the mug and spoon were not washed we washed it ourselves the telephone did not have any instructions on how to use it so calling the reception or room to room or operator was practically not possible i tried dialing and and all the lower bottons to no avail
