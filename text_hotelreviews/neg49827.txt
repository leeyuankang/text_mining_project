unfortunately the very helpful porter was not representative of the rest of the front of house hotel staff we found most of the staff to be from eastern europe and they had little idea of how to provide service with a smile they often had limited english language skills and no idea of pleasant efficient service this was particularly clear in the breakfast room where tables were left messy and dirty long after patrons had finished cutlery and crockery were often not readily available and staff were curt at the front desk you could be lucky and meet someone helpful and pleasant but equally you could meet someone very abrupt and rude the hotel also has a ridiculous policy of charging by the hour for wifi use nobody does that any more
