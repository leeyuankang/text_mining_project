the wifi broke down on our first day of arrival which was extremely inconvenient as we struggled to find a store that sold sim card on a sunday we asked the receptionist and she said it was because the hotel was fully booked it was not an acceptable excuse and we had to use the paper map to plan tomorrow s trip without a way to communicate with our family and friends nevertheless it was already fixed on the next day the bed on the other hand was not the cleanest one i found dusts on my blanket so it was not very confortable for the location although there were quite a number of shops on the street right before you make a turn towards the hotel it was minutes away from the wien westhbf
