a short guide to the facilities avaliable in the hotel a map of local restaurants etc might be useful to visitors although we weren t personally charged for internet service there is normally a per day room charge free in the lobby area and we did overheard several people complaining about it most hotels now include this as standard we didn t have breakfast in the hotel having just tea and a few slices of toast apparently wasn t possible although listed on the sample menu provided in the room service leaflet told in the restaurant by the waiter that we d have to take toast and jam from the buffet and would then be charged as though we d had the full english breakfast possibly a misunderstanding because of a slight language barrier but annoying
