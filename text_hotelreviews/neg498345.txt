we couldn t find the switches for the lamps above the bed so we called the reception and were tersely told to either remove the card and cut off the electricity or to unscrew them ourselves when we complained a maintenance person was sent up and unscrewed the light bulbs it all felt rather unprofessional and in the morning we found the switches which were low down on the wall in an odd spot behind the pillows i guess the hotel also had no idea where their own light switches were also there was no kettle to boil water i was somewhat sick and it would ve been great to have had a way to make tea otherwise the hotel was fine
