our booking had breakfast but in restaurant there is no place to sit and we had to wait when we found the table the waiters just picked the things without realy cleaning also the hotel had dirty walls broken buttons in elevator the room service does not exist at all and they changed only the towels not sheets the room was cold nobody told us that we must opened alone heating but also with heathing we feel cold the girl receptionist all the time staring at computer and we felt like invisible beacuse she never said even hallo when we go inside or left hotel i realy do not recommend this hotel and i wonder for scores in booking
