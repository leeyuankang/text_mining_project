with a bit more attention this hotel has a huge potential a bit more smile and kindness bit more and bigger towels and better quality toiletteries the one the hotel provided smelled like some cheap men s parfume in the bathroom a bit more attention to details and perhaps some small refurbishment would make it so much better i opted for an upgrade to a superior room don t do that unless you smoke the balcony offered for this upgrade is ridiculous i would not even call it a balcony generally i missed those things that makes me feel it was worthwhile to pay extra for going to a hotel compared to renting an apartment
