we slept in a room that had holes in the bed sheets a mark on the sheets and dust everywhere i am sensitive to dust and at night i had trouble breathing the welcome was by a security guard whose first words to us were how would you like to pay at on a sumday evening the towels were frayed and hard we eventually moved to another room staff were very stern and not at all welcoming overall you feel as if you are intruding instead of being welcomed no late check out available for genius guests
