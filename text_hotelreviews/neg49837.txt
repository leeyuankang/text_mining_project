i paid for a luxury family room to include breakfast and wifi the room we were placed in was a recently remodeled meeting room though the room was spacious and clean our view or lack thereof was literally a brick wall ironically to be a prior meeting room the wifi was very slow and most times nonexistent this made conducting business very difficult i politely informed the front desk and was told they would have a technician check reset the router if he did it did nothing to fix the issue
