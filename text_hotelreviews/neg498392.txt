actually the hotel does not have any stars so the information in here is not true the room was not clean mini bar nothing but soft drinks the staff trying to be polite but not very successful the smell is like an old building and the room looks cheap worst thing is that when i chose the hotel i saw good pictures photoshop or something several stars i asked why they say they have stars as they dont and the reception girl tried to explain with some story but could not actually tell the bathroom was not clean positive thing mmmmm may be the parking you have it and its private
