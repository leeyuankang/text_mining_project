we had ants in the room they weren t everywhere initially spotted them in the bathroom and i figured housekeeping would notice but they were still there when we returned to the room no slippers or bath robes in the room even though it s a star hotel only towels per person one for body and another for hair face hands so you have to pick no electric kettle unless charged euros and the one we got smelled like soup probably because someone thought that s how you use an electric kettle i have to drink medicinal tea in the morning and i didn t really feel like paying euros for cups of water biggest inconvenience is that there is no iron in the room you have to get one from downstairs even if it s free it s annoying to have to ask for it every time or spend an hour ironing all your clothes at once i also hit my head pretty hard on the bed frame because it s very low it makes for a nice ambiance with the lights but it s not very practical the minibar was very small even for a minibar with bottles of water the tv had maybe channels in english and italian but by now i m used to this in vienna families traveling with kids might not be so happy though all in all it s good for a short stay and the minuses were not very hard to overlook but things could be better
