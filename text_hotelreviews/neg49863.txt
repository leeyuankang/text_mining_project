the service was terrible felt as if they were looking down on us because we are a young couple maybe they were seeing to other guests older before us and when we first arrived i had to go down to reception times because they kept making mistakes about our room e g we paid for a double room and they put us in a twin then they forgot to change the key card over to the other room etc also was on the room phone for minutes and got transferred to another hotels phone they also wanted to take out of our account when we arrived in case we had any meals or snacks when we were there
