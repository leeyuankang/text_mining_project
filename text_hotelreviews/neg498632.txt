breakfast was pretty poor day after day the exactly identical menu was served for a germanic city there was no bacon and no sausage and no beans grilled tomatoes or potato in any form in the fact the only thing slightly warm was scrambled eggs which came in single portions inside glass tumblers apples were the only fruit i had asked for gluten free meals and got gf bread but no cereals this was quite annoying because gf cereal is not costly a box providing servings costs euros but i had to buy my own from a local supermarket i would not stay for more than a weekend in this hotel as i would be bored to death with the monotonous breakfast we had asked for a double bed but we got two singles pushed together with a gap in between when we complained they said all rooms were kitted like this but instead arranged for a topper sheet which was quite comfortable the taxi fare from the airport was euros which is expensive the metro and train system would have been much cheaper
