this is a small perhaps a boutique hotel so facilities outside of the room were limited eg restaurant wasn t open in tge evening any of the days i was there my biggest complaint was the lack of air conditioning it was summer so this was a problem an upright fan did just enough to enable me to sleep but if it had been any warmer and for a few days the fan would have been useless
