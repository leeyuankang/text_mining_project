we had the classic room so we did not have too much shelf space i did not unpack our suite cases i always pack everything in the packing cubes with the zipper and mesh on the top each cube has specific clothe etc separately for my husband and myself so all in all it s not difficult to manage there is enough space to conveniently place both suite cases on the floor so for us it was not a problem one more thing i want to mention that easy to correct it is hard to understand the shower system there are three knobs but which one responsible for what i was not be able to figure out after days and i consider myself a smart person i just tried that knob and this knob and after several minutes i had a very nice and warm shower bathtub is a little bit high so if you have some sort of disability then it s hard to get in and out you will need some help
