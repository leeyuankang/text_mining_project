one of the reception clerks was downright unpleasant and unhelpful the italian and the chinese gentlemen at the reception on the other hand were nice and polite the breakfast is much worse than is customary in this class of hotel in vienna they are cutting corners eg no decent breakfast cereals only the cheapest and least healthy ones the breakfast is managed by a woman who thinks she looks like sissi it is a pity she swears so loudly and that her manners are so inappropriate i would not return to this hotel
