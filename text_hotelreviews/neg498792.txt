although understandable for the season it was impossible to get requested early check in the room was ready only at and when i complained the receptionist answered that he can find me another hotel which sounded more like a threat rather than help i really did not like his attitude on the day of my arrival although i requested bedding without feather because of allergies my pillows were of course with feather the pillow without feathers i got was extremely hard and uncomfortable but i learned my lesson not to complain
