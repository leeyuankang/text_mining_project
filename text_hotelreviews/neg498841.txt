we had met both very friendly young staff and very rude mature receptionists reception manager the manager insisted to charge us for another room that was canceled month ago and we had shown them the cancellation number prior to checking in whilst he just claimed that we had rebooked it again after our cancellation we had wasted an hour for checking in the next day we both felt that manager purposely turned his back on us we were so tired after long flight and some of the staff attitude really spoiled our mood for holiday
