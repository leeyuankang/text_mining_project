the room was acceptable but tiny and s style but there was a terrible smell in the bathroom i told the staff went out and when coming back they told me someone checked the bathroom it just needed fresh air so he put my trolley into the bathroom door so it will stay open incredible of course the bad smell filled also the room and i had to open the window for some fresh air in a very cold evening but to reach the window was very hard because of furniture and lamps no help from the staff they just agreed to open the heating for half an hour the bad smell was there for the entire night
