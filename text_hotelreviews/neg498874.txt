although the location is excellent however we were located in the room on the first floor on the street side everyday early in the morning we heard the loud and noisy from the truck loading the garbage from in front of the hotel this was really bad situation the room was clean in different standard one day it was nice the other was dirty esp in the toilet the front reception is no so nice the last day he offered my son for transportation to airport but he did not not explain what it would be or the price when i asked him again he said he would tell us in details if we really needed the breakfast was simple and not much variation we were quite disappointed in overall as we used to stay here long time ago
