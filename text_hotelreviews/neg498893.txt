hotel is rather outdated in terms of carpet and furniture access to the room is rather difficult if you like mazes you actually may enjoy the strange access system i asked for a room with a nice view and i got one at floor with view towards other rooms at less than no privacy no heating during the night it is very cold in the room i asked for ironing service offered by the hotel but i could not pay it by card cash only
