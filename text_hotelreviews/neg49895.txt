i would request a room closer in to the reception area as it is quite an expansive place my room must have been a quarter mile from the entrance but it was delightful and quiet but far it is the oldest hotel in london fyi and they are quite proud of it staff was delightful restaurant staff was kind and adorable but a little flaky but lovely
