just about everything was a little off very lumpy uncomfortable bed and lots of other little irritations that added up to a less than good stay particularly as i was there for ten days on business had i not pre paid i probably would have moved not enough hangers and no extra to be had very cheap iron with no steam feature so i couldn t get the wrinkles out of clothes cheap hairdryer that kept overheating after just a minute cleaners forgot to come one day despite my calling on the days they came they often forgot something so i took to leaving them notes not replacing towels or coffee etc room service constantly got the order wrong and food was mediocre the lifts are old and tiny and just one was working the entire ten days i was there there are a lot of rooms so that was inconvenient worst of all was the air con which emitted musty stale air
