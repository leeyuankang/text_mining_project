a lot they sale a basement room without properly informing you on it the title is sous terrain which in dutch means basement go figure that out so we paid a lot for a stay in a room underground would never have choose that room if i would have known it has a small window you can see people feet passing by the breakfast is pretty skimpy when stuff run outs they don t auto fill it you have to ask them to do so and it runs out pretty quickly also stuff comes out slowly when you order it from the kitchen it seems it doesn t keep up with the amount of guests the coffee itself was great and fast the bathroom isn t sound isolated from the room the door itself isn t blocking the entire entrance and it s a bit transparent
