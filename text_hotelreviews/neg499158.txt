our room was left open by cleaners while we were out not happy about that as anyone could have gone in and it left our belongings very vulnerable the reception staff were very apologetic and they did give us x free breakfasts x drinks and some chocolates by way of apology they spoke to the cleaners who had also left dirty towels all over the bathroom floor half drunk drinks not ours on the coffee table and the following day we received a bath towel with huge holes in it we didn t bother reporting the holey towel as we were leaving the next day
