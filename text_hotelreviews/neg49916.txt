avoid this hotel if you want to enjoy london without being scammed and burgled housekeeping is an utter rudeness entering our room without a knock on the door on our first afternoon and cleaning up our room the following day when we have clearly put a do not disturb sign booked online through the hotel s own booking site for our extended stay because we were offered a lowest price or otherwise discount guarantee when we finally found out that booking com price was cheaper they refused to give us their guarantee talked about this issue to the manager in charge but seemed there were near nothing they can do unacceptable for an establishment of this calibre
