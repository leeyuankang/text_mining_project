the downside of the location is that the hotel is situated on a major street with a tram line therefore not so quiet our first room on the groung floor facing the backyard didn t receive the traffic noise but a much worse sound from the garden probably from the building s ventilation there are fancy iluminated bedside light switches which we had to cover with papers when we went to sleep the blinds were not very effective against the morning light
