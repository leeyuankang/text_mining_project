the room was certainly big enough for a sofa which i think would have been a nice addition the main downside for us was that the bathroom was next to the bed area and didn t have a proper door it was like a shower door so didn t close properly or have a lock and didn t allow for any privacy when you needed to use it there wasn t a bath but the shower was large and had a rain shower head which was lovely
