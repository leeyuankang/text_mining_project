our toom was a bit too humid and the windows were sealed we couldn t let some fresh air in it was also a bit chilly unles you turn the ac on but it also turned on automatically during the night so we had to get up and regulate the mode do that the temperature was comfortable the price was a little bit too high but considering the rates in ansterdam we are lucky we ve got a good deal
