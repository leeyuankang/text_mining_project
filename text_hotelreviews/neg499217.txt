this hotel is overpriced for the stars since the breakfast is simply a nightmare the sink in the bathroom was not cleaned well besides was my room on the ground floor very noisy and i could hear charis moving the minibar had two bottles of water and two soda cans also not worth the price and ranking all overall i would expect more from a star hotel and their employees
