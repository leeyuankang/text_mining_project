arrived late and were told no food was available to be precise i m really surprised that nothing was on offer so we had to settle for peanuts in the bar not impressed by the reception staff s attitude and a bit stand offish asked for a late checkout to make things easier as our flight wasn t till and was told that it would cost us euros per hour wow really surprised as we had spent near on euros inc drinks meals and nights stay would have expected better overall a really nice hotel very friendly and helpful bar and breakfast staff and they deserve credit where it s due reception staff did move us to another room at our request due to our room being noisy with traffic at the front rear room not as nice but much quieter
