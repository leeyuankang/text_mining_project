the cleaning could have been better it is pretty dark in the room that is why the housekeeping might not notice some spots half of the towels have unpleasant smell during my first stay i had used vanity kit in my room and the lights would not change for days during the second stay i had torn bed sheets and used pillow case however when the issue is raised to the hotel staff it in most of the cases it is solved the same day there are no shelves in the room had to put underwear and sportswear in the bedside case
