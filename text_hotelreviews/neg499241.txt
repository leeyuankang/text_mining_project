pillows on the bed are too big for sleeping on it s like i was siting up whilst sleeping upon arrival at we couldn t check in to our room until we were very tired and just wanted to sleep but instead we had to walk around town for hours also food menu is not the best could do with more everyday types of food like burgers or pizzas
