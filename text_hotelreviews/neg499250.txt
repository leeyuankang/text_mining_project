don t take the rooms located at the basement with no firm wi fi near to the staff rooms we ordered rom for two business partners asking for seperate beds but got two beds connected that have to be seperate by our selves there is no real door at the toilet so it was not comfortoble to use the toilets when you are two partners the rooms are quite small we rent a car and thought that the parking is free to the hotel guest however it was very expanssive almost eur per day
