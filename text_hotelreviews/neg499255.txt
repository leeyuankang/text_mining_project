i have booked based on the enthusiastic feedback of previous travellers the room was nothing special i have chosen a room with canal view in reality the hotel is located at a corner with a big road and bridge so there is absolutely not the typical canal view atmosphere of other places nearby the furniture in the room are quite normal nothing special if you think this is classified as a boutique hotel it seemed an hotel belonging to an hotel chain in term of location is quite near to the museums are and with minutes walking from the canal area
