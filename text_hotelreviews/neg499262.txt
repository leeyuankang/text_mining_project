the pillows were a bit too big for my liking gave me a neck ache bathroom situation is a little uncomfortable it looks great but the set up doesn t allow for any privacy when using the bathroom it would be better if there was a pane of glass between room and bathroom to afford more privacy i felt so uncomfortable using the toilet had to use communal toilets not very romantic to hear your partner going to the toilet
