i have asked to get late checkout at reservation at checkin the night shift confirmed it won t be a problem but still we should check with the day shift on the last day i did and he told us it s not possible then he did say it s possible for an extra euros this tells me they room was available but despite earlier promises they just wanted more money as i was running the marathon i did need a shower after the race we ended up not paying the extra eur packed in a hurry hope the staff liked the cheese we left in the minibar and had a rather uncomfortable shower in the gym not a pleasant experience won t return here also the room was pretty noisy and the pillow too high but all that would have not been a real issue
