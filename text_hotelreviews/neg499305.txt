we originally got a room in the basement floor which was very depressing and with a window in the level of the sidewalk considering the price we pay this was not acceptable the woman in the reception was understanding and with paying a little extra we got upgraded to a nice room with a view room are slightly on the smaller side and even though the bathroom is large and nice i wish the bathroom door gave more privacy and closed like a normal door
