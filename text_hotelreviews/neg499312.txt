the location is not the best not in the centre and not near shops or coffee shops the rooms are small and the windows can t be open the showers are not well maintained and the price for that return is way to ridiculous will not recommend on that hotel there are others hotel with great location cheaper than that nothing in that hotel is special than others basic basic basic for sure not boutique hotel
