we were initially put in a tiny room right next to the ground floor staff exit all afternoon while we were trying to sleep after our transatlantic flight there were laundry carts banging in and out of the door right outside our room and there were staff standing right outside our windows and then there were roofing repairmen shouting up to their coworkers on the roof after four straight hours of this i complained and they gave me a different room but charged euros extra had to move out of the new room the next night because it was booked already really not a great experience
