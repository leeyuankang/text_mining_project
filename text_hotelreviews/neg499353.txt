really nice hotel but no option to have a smaller breakfast so i had to pay over for a bowl of cereal and a cup of coffee maybe if an alternative choice was offered for a continental breakfast at a cheaper price would be an idea i am staying at the hotel again next week and will not be having breakfast there because of the price
