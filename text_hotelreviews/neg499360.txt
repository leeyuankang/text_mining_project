april our room on the ground floor overlooked a scruffy garden courtyard room was basic to say the least although perfectly clean it was noisy as next to reception and the bar we had arrived after a long haul flight and were shattered we were told by the male receptionist that booking a taxi to the airport for the following morning would cost a pre agreed euros which turned out to be completely untru we were charged euros and the driver was extremely rude saying that it could never cost just euros to the airport
