i booked this hotel based upon the reviews i use booking com because i love the customer based rating system and rarely have a bad experience i booked two rooms over a month in advance initially we were five weeks before the trip we were four so i changed the reservation cancellation without penalty was possible until days before the reservation the price remained the same so upon check in i asked them to please adjust the price as we were only and i made the change weeks ago i was told if i had made the reservation through the hotel he would be able to change it without a problem since it was through booking com it was up to booking com and they would have to telephone them during check out i asked about this she said there were no notes in the system regarding this she claimed they would lose part of the commission if they changed the price she also claimed that her colleague at the next desk had just accidentally deleted a note regarding the commission on our account i telephoned booking com on my telephone and was told the commission isn t considered with a change only a cancellation the booking com representative said the decision was completely up to the hotel and asked to speak to the hotel representative i heard the hotel representative say they booked a triple room they must pay for a triple room the hotel representative told me that booking com didn t send them a notification i made an early check in request through the same booking com system notting hill quickly responded with their check in and check out times and offer to hold our luggage if we had arrived with only and wanted to change it upon arrival i completely understand however i made the change weeks in advance this is rare so i was quite happy usually things happen last minute and you are stuck with the charge this is where i feel notting hill completely failed booking
