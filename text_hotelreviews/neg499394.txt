prior to travelling was taken from my card as a pending transaction then on arriving i had to pay the fee and on top of this another euro s as a deposit all of these requirements were not made aware to me until i arrived therefore i had to spend an extra which i got back in the end before even staying at this hotel it just made it very expensive and ate into spending money this should be made far clearer to guests before they stay
