the bar i understand that it s a boutique but with such a well stocked bar it would be nice if the bartender knew the classic cocktail menu and how to prepare cocktails formally i requested a gin martini and had to guide the bartender through the process which was ok until the next customer requested a white russian and he too had to provide directions and an ingredient list for his cocktail
