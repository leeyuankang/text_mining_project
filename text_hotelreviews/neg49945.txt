service at breakfast was poor and attitude of one person was dreadful however the rest of the staff were excellent and so i am hopeful that it was a one off needs organisation for both waiting staff and food for breakfast we had to wait minutes for eggs having been told one or minutes so the rest of breakfast got cold other than that the food was fine and choice was good
