on our last day we had an early start to the airport and were woken by an extremely loud fire alarm in sheer panic we ran down the stairs from the attic rooms to see what was going on and no one explained what had happened they just shouted go back to room we went back to the room and tried to sleep but the alarm continued to go off so we couldn t get back to sleep and ended up staying awake and went to the airport absolutely shattered
