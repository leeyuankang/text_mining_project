i didn t like that fact that deposit was taken from my bank account on arrival in case of any damage this was not explained properly and the money was not refunded for five days after our stay very few of the lifts were working and the ones that were weren t properly marked leftover room service food had been left on trays outside of the lifts which was a disappointing sight on arrival
