the rooms weren t vacuumed everyday and the maid didn t sweep behind the bathroom door not sure if they try to save electricity with the vacuum but the beds were fixed everyday towels were only replaced if thrown on the floor something we realized a couple of days in but if you called for fresh towels or anything you needed they were quick to come overall a great place to stay we really loved the hotels charm
