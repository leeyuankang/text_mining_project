the breakfast was awful so bad that we left it on the table wasted and went to a local cafe rubbery eggs soggy tastless bacon dry burned hash browns ordered coffee but the cream tasted very odd not pleasant at all and i can t believe we were charged each for such a disappointing meal overall very clean room but there was some kind of sticky residue on the carpet by the bedside table and it stained my fabric bag the bathroom floor was also sticky to walk on it was odd woken by housekeeping early ringing the room bell after a late night would be helpful if they read the door sign we hung to not be disturbed but mistakes happen and did apologise
