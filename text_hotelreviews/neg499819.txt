for the second year running when we had booked a twin room we were given a double room and had to insist on having the twin room we had booked after much hassle and seeing one of the managers coming out of a private room and telling him about our problem he got involved the receptionist wasn t interested she was busy but we were guests staying in the hotel too and she should have finished dealing with us before turning her back on us and helping other people not a pleasant start to our stay they put a put you up bed into a king size bedroom not much room in the bedroom with the extra bed in it as you can imagine it was a bit tight but it wasn t ideal and although the bed was comfortable i didn t sleep very well on it at all the general manager rang us the next morning and apologised to us and offered us free breakfasts and discount off the first night as an apology he had now found us a twin room he was very professional and helpful and if we hadn t had the same problem on the previous stay i would have felt inclined to try the hotel again but the same thing happening on both the occasions we stayed there is too much and i don t think that we will stay there again
