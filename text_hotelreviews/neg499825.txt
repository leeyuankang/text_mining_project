the mattresses were not comfortable at all and have seen their best days combined with a wiggly bedframe we didn t have a good night sleep in my experience box spring beds are more or less the standard in star hotels these days also the continental breakfast section is fairly poor cheap pre baked buns and definitely not worthy of a star rating all in all we were a bit underimpressed by this hotel
