house keeping needs to get their act together i found the hair dryer only min before departure hidden in one of the cupboards the number of cupboards and drawers is a good thing but all tools should be visible also there was no hair shampoo just liquid body soap other hotels of this level also offer toothbrush toothpaste comb etc the tv program could be substantially improved there were just standard channels with very old material i did not find an internal movie program
