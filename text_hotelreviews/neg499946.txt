access to the club lounge was a nice touch but when you advertise hour snacks i would expect to see some snacks in the room apart from pear drops no snacks at all the coffee was good would have been nice to have soft drinks available as well also advertised was drinks canapes in the lounge from when we arrived at there we no canapes were finally replenished at about we had to ask for glasses for the wine and they ran out of beer no one seemed to come and check the stocks
