we came for new year s eve and had booked a double room when we arrived and went to our room it was much smaller then we expected and the room had only been set out for person to stay there i e towel and glass however once we went and complained about this we were then taken to another room which was much bigger however i was told this was the same price no sure how the both rooms could possibly be the same price when the difference in size was massive
