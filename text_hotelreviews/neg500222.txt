nightmare visit the noise of the regular aeroplanes taking off in the morning from about is unbearable i thought the first one was about to crash it was so shockingly loud a dodgy adapter was plugged in when we first arrived and so i blew all the fuses for our room and next door within minutes of arriving so after sitting in the dark for ages we were moved to another room when they decided it couldn t be fixed staff were unprofessional and promised us they would serve us at the bar in minutes after the floor had dried but after mins of us waiting and them socialising loudly they closed up and went home for the night when we told reception about our electricity problem there were chefs drinking cocktails at the desk who couldn t help us
