very very very thin walls i could hear the person next door on the toilet and full conversations a private party so unable to use terrace bar which one of the reasons for choosing this hotels rather than others in the area also went to the bar at to be told it was closed and we d have to wait for night staff not sure why they couldn t cross over so no disruption to guests
