i normally give this hotel an excellent score i have been staying here for ca years each time i visit london however this time was a disaster renovations ongoing while i understand that such things have to happen a star hotel should have warned their guests before arrival into the reception area which was effectively a building site i could deal with that i can understand they cannot close but being given a room in an area where shelves were still being put up noisely with painting going on in the corridors and the last straw being woken at on a weekday morning by painters sanding down the door in the room next to mine opening a floor before the work is completed bad move baileys very unprofessional and little understanding from the staff
