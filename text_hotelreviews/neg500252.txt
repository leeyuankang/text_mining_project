rooms are really small and there is no privacy when going to the bathroom due to lack of proper air flow in the bathroom everything feel wet constantly make sure you leave the sign to clean the room when going out if you want service it seems that if you don t there is no service and with the above issue in the bathroom you most probably will want to have the room cleaned every day the walls are also quite thin so you can hear everything your neighbors are doing or saying breakfast is quite sad for the price requested especially the coffee seems to be drawn directly from the thames river and the air conditioning in that area blows air directly from the north pole i also highly recommend that a notice is given before the windows are cleaned so that the customers will not present themselves au naturel to the window cleaners
