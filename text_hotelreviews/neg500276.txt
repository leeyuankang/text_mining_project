we turned up at very hot and stressed as transport of due to cancelling of tube meant it took hours to get to hotel upon arrival we thought we could book in at which was late anyway compared to most hotels to be told at our rooms were not ready when i asked about this and displayed my frustration was then told we could have both of our rooms not the best start the rooms were very very small we booked a double room at for one night if i had to stay there for more than one night i would feel it would be too small not enough room to swing a cat no air con and it was outside no tv no hairdryer and no wardrobe just hooks on the wall with a hanger from it toilet door swings inside and outside toilet area to ensure space to move but no privacy rooms just far far too small the cost of the breakfast at a head was very disappointing for the offer breakfast hot option which only offered scrabbled egg and beans i do not eat meat was not what i expected missing the hash browns mushroom and tomatoes would i stay there again for value no
