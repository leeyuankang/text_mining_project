everything apart from the free wifi plug sockets were hidden rooms were too small everytime you opened your room door an alarm went off toilets in the bathrooms didn t flush properly there were no obvious handle on the toilet to flush there not having any tvs in the rooms as i prefer to watch tv by myself and not in the guest lounge so i prefer to have personal viewing to myself the bar on the curtain rail was slanted and the wifi connection wasn t all that good so could have been better so will be staying in a different hotel next time i visit london
