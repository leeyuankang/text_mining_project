the room is big as a shoe box there is no room for your bags and the window is drafty so you can feel the cold air coming through while you sleep on our first day the shower gel compartment was empty which i found out after getting wet in the shower the staff was cooperative but told us that we had to wait for minutes because they are busy at the moment after dressing up and going to the reception myself i found the of them talking and nobody else at the reception also for a star hotel i would expect a hair dryer in the room and not having to get one from the front desk one outlet in the toilet was not wired completely so there were wires tucked in a plastic box without a protective cover on it the walls between the rooms are pretty thin so the acoustic insulation is pretty bad you can just hope that your neighbours are not noisy the location is pretty good minutes from the train station but it still takes around minutes to get to the touristy center of london
