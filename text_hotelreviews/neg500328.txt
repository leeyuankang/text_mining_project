the rooms are extremely small and have limited facilities i would mind if it was cheap but it isn t we couldn t move around the room with having to step aside for each other there were only power sockets that i could find not enough if you want to have the lamp on boil a kettle charge both phones the kettle had to be boiled on the floor because the lead was too short to reach the desk the lighting is harsh eg when you want to read in bed and the other person wants to sleep
