being an engineer the noise from the plumbing was not good if someone flushed the toilet in the room above you knew it some acoustic treatment to the svp runs and a bit of insulation and pressure management to the water services would go a long way to cure the noise also the fire alarm had bright leds which flashed every now and again which was a bit annoying being an architect the wayfinding in the hotel looked good but was quite difficult to read especially as the day turned into night as the brushed stainless steel and the low level lighting with reflective grey paint made it hard to read and easy to miss especially as i was new to the building hey my eyes aren t getting any younger the latout of the toilet door and its combine use as a shower screen was novel but was a bit of a fail in my book it also did not offer a feeling of security when you were sitting on the loo all of these points are fairly picky but i m an architectural engineering consultant so
