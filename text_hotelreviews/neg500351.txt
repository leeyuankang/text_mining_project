the window doesn t open which made the room stuffy at night despite ventilation it s not worth paying extra for the river view unless you are on floor our room was on floor facing a walkway the shower toilet doesn t have a key and the door doesn t shut properly the information on the room facilities was scanty we didn t discover the temperature control panel until just before we checked out the choice of tea provided in the room twinings earl grey and green tea was good but the coffee was standard nestl not only is it poor quality but also incongruous with the hotel s ethics
