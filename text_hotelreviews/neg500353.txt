we had terrible service in the restaurant and ended up leaving without any food because the waitress couldn t handle more than table at a time and we didn t even manage to place a drinks order in min the bedrooms are not sound proofed in any way and i was kept awake by the guy in the next room chatting on facetime all night also the bathroom only had a glass swinging door which was highly impractical as the light would shine through into the room waking my husband up finally the tea and coffee facilities were extremely stingy which didn t go down very well after a poor nights sleep thanks to all the noise
