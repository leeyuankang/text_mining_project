the toilet flush pressure is inadequate i was told this is because they pull the water out of the thames and they need a bigger pump to make it better the rooms are a quite small certainly not ideal if you want to spend any length of time there think along the lines of a cruise liner bedroom and you ll get the idea not the hotel s fault but the parking is a rip off beware staying more than hours or they charge you another flat rate the ticket machine is plastered with signs stating they don t accept abuse i d suggest many people have been caught out by this sharp practice and voiced their dissatisfaction to the operator
