to summarize our experience even though the idea and design is cool we didn t really feel welcome the main problem is staff that from the guest perspective reminds of a sect where they act as if they possess some kind of superior knowledge of things examples at breakfast an employee was explaining things in an arrogant way and loud to her new colleague she told her that if the guests are not happy with the breakfast it is their own problem as they the guests are so stupid quote that they in most cases don t even know what continental breakfast is another guest was having an argument with an employee next morning claiming that she is rude and could smile at least once the employee did not agree react in a nice manner and they had a lengthy discussion as far as we understand the concept of the hotel includes hiring long term unemployed however we felt that they literally hire anyone from the street and these specific people have been unemployed by a reason even though we liked a lot about the hotel and some of the staff at some points we had a feeling that anything can happen with you in such a place that it can burn down or sink and this is not really what you expect from a hotel you want to be able to rely on the personnel if the hotel manages changing staff policies and focuses more on democratic and inclusive style rather than pseudo hipster things such as dj in the lobby and design it will be a great place for everyone
