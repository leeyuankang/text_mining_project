took room changes to actually get a room without any major issues the first had aircon heating issues so it wouldn t work this along with no hot water was an instant problem at this time of year the next room we had also had no hot water but we were told it would soon be fixed we went out for the evening and when we got back the lights wouldn t work and still no hot water changed room again and ended up on the other side of the hotel as it would seem there was heating and water issues with the river side we wanted to stay on ended up with two single beds pushed together on the non river side overlooking road works however the staff were pleasant and helped out as best they could every time
