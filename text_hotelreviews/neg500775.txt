the staff at the reception were not very welcoming i had booked two rooms of which the second one was not ready for over an hour and that was quite annoying they seemed inexperienced and were not able to communicate well the hotel was definitely not value for money the breakfast included with the charges had long queues and there was too much waiting before one could eat anything
