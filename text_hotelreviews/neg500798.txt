the reception area is a shambles when you go in there s just people standing about you don t know if they are next or you are next or what which was very overwhelming as you h e just arrived the stay was lovely apart from the aircon didn t really work and the room was very warm plus you couldn t open the windows which was understandable however checking out completely ruined my weekend i was not able to do the express check out as i had paid the deposit in cash so i had to get this back again there was no que and seemed to be very under staffed there was guests trying to check in as well as check out so again people standing everywhere in no kind of order after about minutes some of us guests who were standing about formed a que ourselves however others were then just going up to the guests clearly skipping the que and going before us other people who had been standing there for about minutes when i did eventually get seen to i had to then wait another ten minutes as there was only one person behind the check in desks that either knew how to give the deposit back or was allowed however this person was nowhere to be seen i eventually did get my deposit back however when i expressed that i was annoyed as i had just waited the best part of minutes to check out the two girls behind the desks have me the dirtiest look and just replied with well that can t be helped you can see we are busy what an absolute joke the location of the hotel is great which is why i would consider coming back but will not be anytime in the near future
