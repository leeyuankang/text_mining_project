having stayed at this hotel a few times i felt standards had slipped a little check in took much longer than it should service in the bar was particularly slow although i appreciate this will be dependent on how busy they are little things like no tea bags in the room should have been easily resolved but they sent a handful of peppermint tea rather than breakfast tea which was requested i feel there are a number of hotels in the area that offer as much but at a lower price
