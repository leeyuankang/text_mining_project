we were annoyed in that our booking specified that we were due to arrive at the hotel between and we arrived at and the check in staff informed us that our room wasn t ready unacceptable especially considering we had travelled all the way from south africa furthermore we booked a family suite as our year old daughter was to be staying with us when we arrived in our room i requested that the sofa bed be made up for her while we were out for dinner we returned from dinner at about and this had not been done i had to phone housekeeping at this late hour and insist that someone attend to this urgently
