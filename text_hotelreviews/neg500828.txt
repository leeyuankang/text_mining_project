staff was little bit slow with their service and a lot of small mistakes after one month checking out from the hotel my credit card has still over pounds pre authorization even though i have paid in full when checking out this is because they forgot to cancel it when i was checking out nobody seems to know how to cancel the pre authorization all they can say is that they are sorry not really professional
