the hotel style is very dull and poorly maintained there was a kettle in the room but no complimentary water or coffee tea given for the price you pay for the room staff not professional take very long to process simple check in info hotel is located in a good tourist attraction area but this could have a negative attraction if u have a flight to catch as the traffic could get unbearable and you can miss ur flight is you were not careful with the timing plus the rooms have internal dull and boring windows that not suitable for guests paying a lot of money
