i selected parking and breakfast on booking com on arrival it was valet parking for i waited over an hour for the luggage to be brought to my room despite ringing and asking for it because we were on a tight time schedule i gave up waiting and went to collect it myself from concierge the trolley remained outside our room for days there wasn t any tea or coffee or milk in our room the shower in the pool area had a nasty smell coming up from the drain when used this was the most i had ever spent on night in a hotel as a special surprise for my partners birthday the hotel is lovely and staff helpful and polite so it s a shame these niggles took the shine of our stay
