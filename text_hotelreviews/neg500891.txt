the breakfast was awful and when i advised the staff that it was unsatisfactory as we d paid extra for the complete english breakfast they couldn t have cared less suggesting in fact that since we d booked through booking com that we d opted for the cheap route and therefore couldn t expect much and weren t entitled to anything we were just wondering if there was somewhere else within the property that we could eat they suggested the coffee bar downstairs our dime or starbucks they did say that we could have room service that this was different food but really i ve never enjoyed eating in my bedroom and why would the quality of the food be better for room service than it is for the people who pay extra for breakfast the charge for the full english breakfast is noted to be pounds it was worth pounds it was fine if you wanted cereal and juice but again we paid for the full english breakfast and in that sense it was horrid my sister put her hand through the sheet on the last night of a night stay the towels were old again i think that the quality of the room reflected the fact that we d booked through booking com the waste container in the bathroom was all dinged up and was barely large enough for the bag they had in it what s the point the desk was dusty when we arrived i was able to write in the dust they have a card in your room that they put on your bed each night asking you to consider foregoing cleaning services in return for a small donation to a charity obviously several people before us had opted for this as the room was not clean they do not however offer you the opportunity to have your room cleaned but forego the daily cleaning of your towels replenishment of soaps etc it was either cleaning or no cleaning
