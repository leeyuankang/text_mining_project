asked for a nice view but got the view of the other side of hotel windows couldn t open the windows didn t know there wouldn t be a smoking area on the floor as my friend smokes she was a bit annoyed that she had to keep going to the bottom floor and outside got checked in by a trainee and any questions we asked he couldn t answer properly which was okay as we understand he only started but maybe there should have been someone near
