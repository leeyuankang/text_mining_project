worst hotel ever not worthy for its star price for its level of services and cleanliness after all my friend and i have been through i decide to take a few minutes to share my personal experience with this park plaza westminster bridge london my friends and i got bitten from the night we stayed in seems to be by flea because the bites are always next to each other and couldn t sleep well in the middle of the night the highlight of our stay is that i found a dead bug in our room on our last night i raised it up to the customers service about its room cleanliness and the feedback we got from staff is they need to do the investigation first they sent me the pest control report later the day after we checked out basically saying they couldn t identify any precencse of hugs in our room but the thing is they got our bedding completely changed the night we found the bug and examed our room after we checked out and issued this report which basically trying to say those are not their problems how can we believe that the night when we called the customer service the staff said their manager will speak to us but so far after days no one has called me but just one email with that unconvinced report attached from an customer relations officer from that hotel still they didn t make an explanation about where this bug comes from no solution no whatsoever some other concerning details including careless housekeeping staff didn t clean up the mirror forgot to replace the hand towels left cups unwashed for days even though we put beside the sink the bed sheet also have dirty spots i m not using the luxury hotel standard to measure this hotel but i expected some basic cleanliness which this hotel seems to have a long way to go also the professionalism and attitude in that hotel handling that issue needs better training too i can go on putting more details here but decided save more of my time on this terrible hotel
