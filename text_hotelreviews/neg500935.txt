the view was not desirable as it was a window was closely parallel to a wall even though the room booked was described to have interior view i did not imagine it would be this closed off the description of the room also included soundproofing but i felt this was not so as i heard people coughing in the corridor and people walking by i would advise the hotel to update these descriptions to not lead on their customers
