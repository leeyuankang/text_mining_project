in the morning we made our way to the restaurant for breakfast purposefully waiting until after so that it was less busy upon arriving at the restaurant which was only half full we were directed downstairs to a half empty conference room with tables and chairs dispersed around the room for our breakfast i was intrigued by the large amount of young families and foreign tourists that had been sent downstairs as well as us with no similar groupings in the restaurant upstairs i had noticed that the restaurant was full of many people in suits having breakfast i found this extremely disappointing and this was not the experience that i had hoped for i or anyone else that stays at the park plaza should not expect to be treated any differently because of how we are dressed and i am dismayed to feel that if i had been in my business attire on friday or this following tuesday morning that i would have been seated in the restaurant i chose the park plaza because it is conveniently located extremely close to my work and i have only ever received recommendations from people to stay there however after this experience i will be seeking alternative accommodation for when i need to stay overnight in westminster
