the telephone in the room was not working seemingly because cleaning staff had not reconnected it correctly the wash basin plug was faulty and could not be repaired because relevant staff were not on duty on sunday this defect was obvious and must have been there when the previous occupant of the room was there the plates for hot breakfast were cold because so i was told the heater was not working the person to whom i addressed my concern was unable unwilling to procure a hot plate from another source
