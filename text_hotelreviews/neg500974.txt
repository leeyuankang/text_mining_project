the breakfast was repetitious always the same things we would have liked having a pancake or waffles for a change but we would have had to pay additional all hotels will have been to would not have an extra charge for this after spending days the food had become very blah always the scramble eggs which usually were cool and not tasty sausage and ham were very greasy the pastries were the only good choice
