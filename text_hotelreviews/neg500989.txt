everything to start nobody greets you at the entrance talking about bags me and my wife had to carry our bags to the superior room on the floor because staff could care less the receptionist was so rude i start questioning who maybe someone with no degree and any experience in hiring hired those people i can only guess what decision making process was behind the selection process the barman from third world country was so friendly to me that at some point it felt that i was his little bro as he called me or even better i was the servant not him bathroom in the room was falling apart awful many other negative thing including no waiter in mini bar on the next business day i just wish i had never stayed in that awful hotel it actually more a hostel for wealthy people than a star hotel
