waiting at reception they brought us apple juice which was nice but i have no idea why it took so long to deal with a small number of people why did they decide to steam clean the bar at midnight when there were still many people in there enjoying a drink it was very noisy the bars and restaurants do not use the fabulous view instead you have to pay extra to get that privilege which is very annoying pool looks great but its the whole spa is hardly relaxing when you have kids screaming and jumping in the pool surely kids should be allowed into the pool at set times rather than from to when adults might actually want to enjoy a relaxing time at the spa
