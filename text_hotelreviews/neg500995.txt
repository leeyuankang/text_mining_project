i booked a room that was actually a room for people with disabilities i was not told that when i went to check in the hotel clerk only mentioned that there was no bath tub in the room which i sai d it was fine but to my surprise the room was not what i needed at all i quickly called reception and they told me that they could switch my room to one which had an external view for an extra pounds i told me them that on booking com there were other rooms available for the same price i had paid the receptionist told me that booking com had not updated their system i was not able to take a shower and use the bathroom properly i am extremely disappointed in their lack of professionalism in dealing with this situation i would not recommend this hotel
