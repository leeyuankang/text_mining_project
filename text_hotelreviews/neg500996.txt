we did ask for a happy birthday or something in our room upon arrival for our yr old mother there was nothing we had to go and ask howevery stuart we dealt with was very helpful and sorted things out at breakfast in the restaurant we had out of four mugs with cracks in we have photos to prove this it was too dark in the restaurant and we expected a coffee and teapot for the money when we asked for more hot water it came in a mug not a jug everywhere was too dark not the lighting but the dark doors etc the lightime switches in our room were awful mother is up at and because you did not know which light was to what so she put all the lights on including ours our room was very dusty and not hygienic at all we did report this to loren overall it is a lovely hotel but let down by the cleanliness and finesse especially for the money every year we like to bring mother for her birthday and choose a nice hotel to make it special we chose this one because it looked perfect however we were let down we even paid to upgrade our room with a view what view you were looking at rooftops but if you stood to the right of the window you could just see the london eye it was not worth the money at all we were very disappointed
