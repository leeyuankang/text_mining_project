it wasn t the best value for money in hindsight and i had booked a breakfast room for two on booking com as well as added it to the special requirements to assure this but upon arrival i was told i had only paid for breakfast for the breakfast was only decent definitely not worth the the room temperature control wasn t very good normal was too hot and airconditioning was freezing would ve been better if we could actually open the windows
