i booked this hotel a few months ago as my son was running the london marathon and wanted to book early to avoid disappointment on friday the day before our travel we received an email from yourselves advertising the hotel for less than we paid but unfortunately we were unable to get any reduction on the price paid which is dissapointing i will not be booking any accommodation with yourselves unless last minute bookings
