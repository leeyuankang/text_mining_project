we were not happy with the receptionist when we arrived on the friday morning she did not explain our bill properly and we thought we had paid it on fri to find out on monday we still had some of the bill to pay also we were annoyed when she asked for our passports we came from scotland i do know that most of the staff were not british but i would have hoped she surely knew where scotland was in reference to the united kingdom
