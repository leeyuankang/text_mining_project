i booked a family room and made a mistake by not specifying three people staying in the room later on in the booking so i selected adults as this is the question and didn t select a child as that option was not offered on booking com when we arrived at the hotel early on good friday with our year old we were told that all family rooms has been allocated due to overbooking and seeing as we had not specified three people we could not be offered one due to overbooking this set the tone of our experience
