the hotel needs to be more friendly to families the staff in the spa did not like children at all and were not very polite as a family you could only stay in the pool for minutes and children were not permitted to use the steam bath or the sauna even if they were years old that is not a wellness experience the breakfast was not of a quality for a star hotel bacon was not crispy no fresh fruit or homemade bread you had to pay extra for pancakes waffles and eggs
