the room was dusty in places and the glasses were dirty the shower water went everywhere which was dangerous for me and my partner the view was a disappointment considering the amount of money i paid for the reservation room the reason i booked the hotel was for the view advertised on the website very unsatified with my stay i ve stayed in cardiff park plaza and it was unbelievablely clean and worth the money
