despite asking at time of booking week before upon arrival and when we got to the breakfast area it was very hard to get the gluten free bread that they claimed we should feel welcome to ask for on the menu they claimed it s a room hotel and they can t cater for individuals specific needs but in the same breath claim to offer this as an option they should just be honest up front that half their serving staff can t speak english enough to understand gluten free bread and suggest we bring our own it took to get some which wasn t fresh baked it was clearly just grabbed from a freezer and defrosted plus we were made to feel awkward because we had to ask some many people before we felt confident that our request was being actioned
