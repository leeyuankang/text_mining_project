i didn t like the fact you had to pay upfront just in case you use the mini bar which we didn t and it takes days to refund back into your account this was towards my spending money so was a bit upset that it didn t specify this anywhere on the website or my booking confirmation about any upfront charges also the service was very slow in the ground floor lounge area the waitress came over minutes after us sitting down to be served for our drinks
