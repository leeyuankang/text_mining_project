the only down side was there was a terrible stench of mold mildew whenever the bathroom tap was turned on it was really powerful and we had to brush our teeth in the kitchenette sink my kids and i are all severely allergic and the smell brought on coughing and sneezing it took about half the first night until we realized where the odor was coming from but we figured as long as no one used that tap it would be manageable again the amenities and location made up for that the only other complaint was at about midnight or later a couple next door or two doors down had a frightening screaming shouting fight with a child crying and screaming in the midst of it i called the front desk and the girl spent too much time trying to get me to piece together what was happening i felt she should have sent security immediately lastly i m sure when i booked i mentioned my daughter s very severe egg peanut fish allergy hotel made zero accommodations for her and she couldn t enjoy any meals with us on site and clearly english is a second language for a lot of staff but that s no good to me when i m asking questions about food preparation and safety
