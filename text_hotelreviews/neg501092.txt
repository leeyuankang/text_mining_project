bathroom door handle was broken couldn t shut the door weak shower not acceptable for superior room breakfast was incredibly busy had to wait to be seated cold beans cold mushrooms soggy hash browns couldn t get a proper coffee like a latte or cappuccino instead staff were walking around with jugs of instant coffee that was horrible it shouldn t be unreasonable to expect a good shower and decent cup of coffee in a star hotel in london especially at the price paid for breakfast which can buy you better breakfast and decent drinkable coffee in any cafe in town
