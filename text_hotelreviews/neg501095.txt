staff i was asked if i need help with our luggage because we had suitcases and my parents were struggling moving the big one the guy who came to help us when he saw the suitcases gave me a frustrated look and he was rude when he dropped the suitcases to our room if you don t like that you are doing the wrong job dude anyway i don t want to be picky overall it is an expensive hotel but offering a good value for its money
