i was here years ago and that time i was amazed with service and comfort but in years i can surely say that park plaza westminster obviously degrades and goes down in quality staff is wild incompetent rude especially on front desk e g diana corban is exclusively rude unprofessional person i hardly could squeeze her name and apologies for inappropriate behaviour with customers she said her name only when we called a manager diana corban refused to say her name and she did not have a badge on her suit room service is horrible this time did not clean the room even when we left sign please clean the room reaction on any request is very slow very disappointed with this hotel this time planned to stay here more in next couple of days but cancelled it and changed for another one dont recommend this hotel until its management pays attention to its staff quality
