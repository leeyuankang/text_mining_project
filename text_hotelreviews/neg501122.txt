the staff was very rude and unhelpful the room service food was overpriced we ended up paying for sandwhiches and a drink we had people knocking on our door all night and tugging on the handle to try and get it which was frightening when we told the staff the next morning they said there was nothing they could do wouldnt ever stay here again the location is terrible there are no bars resturants around it
