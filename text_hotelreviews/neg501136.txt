basic breakfast lots of trainee at front staff with often poor command of english politeness and hospitality taps were creaking and noisy which we reported however was dealt with very poorly not the caliber of a star hotel at all front desk service overall was poor with mainly foreign and junior staff with poor hospitality skills will not consider staying again the room was small with basic decor considering the price and star ranking window view is needed otherwise you may feel claustrophobic
