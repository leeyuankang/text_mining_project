normally i am not a person making the same mistake over and over again i stayed in this hotel twice in one year and beleived strongly that i wouldnt face the same kind of problems repeatedly but i did although i have asked months in advance if the room had a view or not since it was my mothers birthday there and my daughters masters ceremony and my mother being used walking sticks room was more important than usual and the photo they showed was just the same as the one in my perivious stay and it had the view but how could i know that double bed and king bed made the view difference and that they wouldnt dare to answer to my request about the room view until i am at the hotel facing the problem they overcharged me there for the view and dared not make any small attempt to celebrate my moms birthday with a smallest gesture how impolite was that i was ashamed to let my mom stay in such a rude hotel our four days there was then a disaster and i would never stay and advice this hotel again i so regret to have cancelled hilton marble arch and decided on this spoiled hotel just due to its location in london besides having no window to let fresh air in didnt make the stay better t smelled moist and mold only liked the kind house keeping lady
