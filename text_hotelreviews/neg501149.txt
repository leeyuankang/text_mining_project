i was a bit disappointed with breakfast both quality and selection i expected better to have a room with view on big ben or london eye was only possible when upgrading read pay extra this was not mentioned when booking i do not expect to have the view but would appreciate having the possibility without an extra charge or be informed upfront that i will not have the nice views if i don t pay more we tried different restaurants nearby and they ranked from poor to bad not hotels fault of course limited time for children in swimming pool
