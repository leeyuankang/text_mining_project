we were checked in by a trainee which is fine however he did not inform of us of some of the basics e g how you dial for reception executive bar information we also had a connecting room which was a disabled room so the shower was slightly awkward due to the room being connected to another guest via a locked door we could hear their child on occasion crying as we were on the inner part of the hotel we had no windows which was a shame due to no natural light coming in we had rang a head in order to confirm our booking and tried to change the room however they wanted an additional per night which was extortionate considering the price we had already paid
