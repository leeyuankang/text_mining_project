by the pictures and the description you would think it s an amazing and clean hotel we got to the hotel and it took a while at check in about an hour then when we got into the room it wasn t the room we actually booked it was much smaller the first think we saw was greasy hand prints on the mirror and cabinets the bed was very untidy and there were make up stains and hair everywhere we complained and they said they would change our room so we were sent back to the same room where we spent hours waiting for the new key cards and porter we got to our new room and it was the room we had already booked in the first place i wanted to complain again as the cleanliness of this room wasn t any better than the other but my partner suggested we just make the most of it as most of our time had been taken away we just went for a walk around town and came back to sleep we woke up and went to the spa which also was a disappointment it looks better in the pictures the cleaning maids kept walking into rooms without even knocking first and would come back every minutes and do the same thing never been so disappointed over went on this hotel ive spent way less for such amazing hotels this one definitely won t be on my bucket list i m not one to complain or send bad reviews but this stay was so disappointing
