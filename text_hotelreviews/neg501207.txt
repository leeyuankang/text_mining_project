my mom and i stayed there for two nights everything was fine until our check out we ordered a meal the night before our check out i made the payment cash because the waiter said nothing about the payment options and signed the receipt i even remember the amount of money i paid when the time has come for check out i told them about the order and payment he did not add the payment to the checkout receipt for that time when we returned home we saw that they took the money from the credit card it was not a lie i don t need to say something that didn t happen it is not a lot of money to care about but it is not the right thing to do it is not a trusting behaviour i want to say that i am very disappointed and will never prefer to stay at this hotel again
