as the usual breakfast room was busy we were asked if we would use the alternative breakfast area which to my horror could only be described as a basement barn ceilings abut ft high the room divided by partitions tables that sat plus the food was stone cold as thd lids remained open so having taken our cold breakfast to our table a mile away we then had to negotiate getting toast thst was in another area of the divided room which lead to ice cold breakfast no teapots tea poured into cups the cereal table was in such disarray and it felt as if was the left overs of the night before the staff in this area appeared not to care it was hard to believe that we were in the same hotel it was expensive and it was so so disappointing
