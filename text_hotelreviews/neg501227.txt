i didn t like when ordering room service i specifically said no mayonnaise in my sandwich which then arrived with maynoasie in i phoned to tell them and they offered to come collect it and change it however at this time it would of taken another half hour so i asked for a refund they come to collect the sandwich and the waiter was very very rude and said it s my fault and they shouldn t be refunding it i even advised him to go listen to the call so i could prove i was not in wrong very poor service and let down the whole stay for me and my partner
