booking com scammed me out of what i thought i had booked the property for and what i was charged upon arrival will never use them again i had also put in for adults and when i got to the hotel they said it was only booked for and charged me more a night for my daughter the customer service person dealing with my issue was not sympathetic and did not offer any consolation like even a free drink as far as the actual hotel the lighting scheme in the room with the buttons took time to learn there was plenty of room for a table and a chair or two to eat at but there was none there there were no drawers to unload our clothes into just a few hangers and a rod the bed was hard as a rock and we asked for an additional down comforter to put under us
