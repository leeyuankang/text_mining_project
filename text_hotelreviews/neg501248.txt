you have to cross the bridge to find a decent restaurant hotel sushi bar was a quite terrible experience due to the expensive price despite the low quality food and hospitality the wifi connection was very bad i could hardly send a message also bad sound proof i could hear every single sound from the corridor so clear that whenever our neighbors doors were knocked i had to check if it was our door
