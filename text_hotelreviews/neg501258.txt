disgusted with the cleanliness i have taken photos after arriving in our room at i noticed there was a sticky stain around the kitchen area with glasses covered in much the windows were so filthy they looked as though they had been cleaned with ketchup once i told the reptionist she sent somebody to clean the room while we waited in the bar to which the glasses where replaced and nothing more once back in the room we decided to just leave it and complain again in the morning so my partner made me a cup of tea while i was getting settled for bed to my disgust the milk was stale and curdled i then decided to all back up to complain my room was still filthy and i can t have a tea so room service brough me a tea up to which i was charged i m disgusted completely and utterly disgusted for a night i would never recommend nor stay again
