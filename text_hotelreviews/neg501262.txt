breakfast was expensive for what it was fruit bowls were no bigger than egg cups at buffet beds were made up but on the last day it looked like the coverlet had just been pulled up and i had to remake it before i could go to sleep but otherwise it is a lovely hotel that i would highly recommend to anyone and would happily stay at again
