we are not very fussy people and loved our stay if i had to pick anything i would say the comfort of the bed was not the best but realise everyone has a preference and we prefer a comfier mattress where as ours was very stiff and didn t sleep very well the first night also as we were visiting without our two small children we were looking forward to a much needed lie in which we don t get often and got woken up both mornings by housekeeping who just came into our room after knocking once which i thought was quite unprofessional as we could have been in any sort of state dress wise in and out of shower etc they were the only two things i can say i wasn t particularly happy about but in the scheme of things can be overlooked
