was a little tired compared to the room we had last time on same floor our plug in the bathroom sink and the lounge tv were broken but fixed whilst we were out on the day also the kitchen sink was badly stained there was a burn mark on the wall over a socket and the chrome effect under the bathroom sink was pealing off the hotel was clearly very busy in fact london was bunged which meant that check in was v slow and the room was not ready until late in the afternoon however the hotel did offer drinks whilst queuing and sent us a text when the room was ready breakfast was heavily over subscribed on our morning we ate in the conference suite in the basement breakfast was cold and we felt like we were on a conveyor belt when ushered to go downstairs again on the morning we asked to wait for a space in the main restaurant which was much better hot and we even ordered pancakes swimming pool was too full we chose the hotel partly for the pool facilities but on the days that we were at the hotel despite trying several times we were unable to use slots were possible to book but only very late after kids were in bed also this room was very hot unlike the other room and the beds uncomfy my dd s bed had springs poking into her all night the hotel did provide very nice feather pillows on request
