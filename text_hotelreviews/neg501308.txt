customer service was quite poor delayed check in as room not ready although i had booked a family suite there was no bed for my son and was expected to share they only had a booking for two adults and not a child until i showed them the booking confimation they did offer us a complementary drink and promised there would be a bed fory son on return back to hotel room at there was no bed and on ringing down was told we had only booked for two adults and wanted me to go back down to reception i explained that i had gone through this at check in and all i wanted was some bedding housekeeping eventually came to sort out it seems that the reception staff did not know what they were doing
