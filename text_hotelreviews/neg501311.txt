to start there was a large queue to check in we had to wait about min before even getting to a desk i noticed this was also the same each day the biggest issue i have is that we reserved a king family room it said it was square but i can assure you it was around only the room layout was terrible as the bed which was only a little larger than a double bed and definitely not a king sized bed was squeezed in a area with very little room on each size in addition there was a hallway with a bathroom in the middle and also small and another small room maybe with a sofa bed the sofa bed was only slightly larger than a single bed and not comfortable for two people i complained and asked for a larger room or a room that could accommodate maybe another bed or room with space for someone to sleep on the floor after discussions over hours they said they were full and had not other options they did finally offer a room with the same layout and only slightly larger maybe meters but it was not ready and they would not let me see it as it was not clean meaning since i was going out for the evening i would have to move the family around as it was essentially the same room we decided not to move they did say i could have two adjoining rooms with no windows but that would cost me pounds more they have no rollaway beds to put in any rooms if you have a family with two children you should get a two bedroom suite or stay elsewhere i did not ask nor they they offer a discount and even the staff members i talked to admitted that it was not a king bed and the room was smaller than stated also the hotel only had the room set up for two people even thought i signed up for i then had to ask them to come and make up the sofa bed and then had to ask for more towels as only towels were in the room
