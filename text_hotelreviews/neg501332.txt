this isn t going to go anywhere and we will not be compensated so i was lothed to say anything guarantee we will get a standard sorry the hotel was great and in a top spot but the beds were the worst we have ever experienced and we travel a lot we all still feel the back pain like steeping on concrete the room wasnt cleaned as you normally expect and were not fussy and overall just felt so un british found it hard to understand some staff overall lovely people just not the british experience we were hoping again we didnt say anything at the hotel as we felt we a couldnt communicate our feelings to staff and b noone will do anthing about it other than appologies my wife was surprised that i didnt thus this again just a nowhere rant at again nice looking hotel an top location just not what we expected and u comfortable nights put a dampner on it kind regards mark metters
