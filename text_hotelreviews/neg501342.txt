we have been to this hotel previously and the staff were amazing but on this occasion the breakfast team leaders management outright ignored us far too busy with their own weekend catch up while waiting right next to them to ask them a question also when asking whether drinks from the bar could be charged to our room the bar tender said we can try i m assuming it s either a yes you have the facility or a no when i asked again as i was unsure what was meant i got the same answer like i might be a bit stupid to be fair all the other staff were super friendly probably just a few letting the side down
