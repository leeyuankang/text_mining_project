overall the stuff is really robotic and not very welcoming billing issues i also had a big issue with the billing i have requested to do the company billing after emails without an answer and visits to the reception with the same question they have finally told me that i can only pay by card that i have phisically on me and the bank transfer will not be accepted at this point bad breakfast i also found the breakfast too be very disappointing for the price when i asked what is included they did announce pancakes and waffles as a part of the menu but once you actually get to the table you discover that those are extra charged which is a complete non sence i have never seen anywhere else you either charge per unit or offer a buffet breakfast not a hybrid option the quality and the variery of the buffet was not that great for the star especially for the vegetatian client leave alone a vegan or gluten free the coffee was too strong and lacking the flavor to sum it up i would not recommend taking the breakfast ordering room service with the porridge or pancakes that are charged extra anyway will be a better option or better more eating somewhere else bathrobe the swimming pool and spa are nice extras included in the price except for one thing i didn t find a bathrobe or slippers in my room upon arrival when i requested it i ve go an ennormous man bathrobe when i then requested a smaller size i ve got a kid s one and only on the attemp they ve got it right
