pillows were so flat it made your head hurt also when we arrived our sink would not drain right so i called to see if another room was available they asked if they could send a technician to my room but who wants to worry about maintenance in your hotel room especially when you re on vacation i respectfully declined and put up with the hassle there was also some technician drilling on the eight floor and this could be heard all the way from the fifth floor still a nice hotel and location just wish they were more accommodating
