for a four star hotel i would have expected it to be a bit cleaner there were stains on the carpet and the curtains in our room the remote was a bit sticky and i don t want to know where the white spots on the backrest of the bed came from also when we booked we expected the spa area to be freely accessible for guests but apparently that s not the case
