the bedroom was so dark all black decor with hardly any lights could not make tea as no light in that area the furniture was black gloss with a black kettle and black tray no biscuits and you had to pay about for bottled water would have expected that for a four star hotel the room was overlooking an internal area but it looked just like a prison did mention lighting to staff at reception on our departure great location shame about the black room
