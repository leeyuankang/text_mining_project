the staff on arrival said i needed to give card details to take money out in case there is any issues with the room i didn t have my credit card on my so i had to use a debit card i thought she said which is fair enough as i did have that spare in my debit card but they actually took which i feel is an absolute rediculous amount to take fair enough it will be going back in but this was never ever stated anywhere in my run up to my stay and i was so shocked to see that amount come out of my account i was not happy about this at all
