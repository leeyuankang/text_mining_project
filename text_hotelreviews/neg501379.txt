no value for money it is expensive but it was my choice but i expected more quality services poor breakfast they have three places for breakfast and only the one has a little more variety also very expensive without any reason staff not polite not very rude they simply did not care i never felt as a customer it was like they did me a favor glass door for the bathroom when we arrive they blocked the whole amount of my stay plus pounds per day as guarantee and so far no problem but when they charged my credit card with the final amount they did not unblock the initial amount affecting the use of my card it was a like a double charge for a week i will never go again it left me a very bad feeling although i adore this city
