the system in the hotel kept crashing down we heard it every day from staff consequently the wifi wasn t working in the rooms we had recurring issues with the card keys to enter the room sauna wasn t working the spa part is very badly maintained and the water in the pool is not warm there are no bathrobes in the room to go to the spa need to be ordered from front desk standard or premium room have view to the inside wall with zero daylight it s an enormous hotel with no personality and rather unfriendly staff on top they do not accept payments with debit cards
