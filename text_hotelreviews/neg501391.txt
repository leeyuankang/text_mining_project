service charge for the drinks in the hotel is a lot and i was appalled to hear from a number of the staff that they don t receive any of this money i asked for the service charge to be removed so that i could give them cash was advised that they couldn t do this this policy gives a very poor impression of the ethos of the hotel and it s owners and will certainly be reflected in the feedback i give to others
