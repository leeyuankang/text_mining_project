all aspects of breakfast were very poor in terms of management location in a conference centre due to overcrowding which was untrue food was dreadful management wandering around too few waiting staff who were under enormous pressure the worst breakfast experience that i have encountered when i articulated my views to the breakfast manager i was met with rudeness need i say more if this is a reflection of management training it leaves a lot to be desired
