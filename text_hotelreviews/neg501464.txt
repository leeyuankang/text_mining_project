staff were so disinterested there was one lovely young chap in concierge but apart from him we found we were barked into a better position in the check in line as we clearly weren t queuing tidily enough it just seems very cold and the staff seem so used to dealing with copious amounts of guests that they can t seem to be bothered even smiling on passing anymore we had a loud knock on the door at on check out day to remind us to check out is this really necessary it s quite un nerving oh and the usual if you try to pay with a debit card they will ask if you have a credit card if i wanted to pay with a credit card that s what i would have presented then tell you because you have paid with debit card you have to pay as you go and cannot charge items to the room which instantly makes you feel like they don t trust you the lifts are a joke and the queues for them seem unrelenting they didn t work the day we left clean comfy bed but the wardrobe doors were covered in finger prints the ledge of the wardrobe was covered in dust and the bedside table also had noticeable dust this was our second stay in london last time we stayed at the apex and our stay was so much more enjoyable there as we felt welcomed and looked after and not an inconvenience
