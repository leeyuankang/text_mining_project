stayed a few days later again for business ate in the room and the food was really not very good at all a very cardboard like pizza breakfast was also pretty tasteless some staff were ok but others were brusque and did not lift the spirit at all this hotel has such a throughput it looks somewhat worn out aircon also fairly noisy both times
