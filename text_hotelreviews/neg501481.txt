breakfast was unfortunately a bit less no bread rolls no croissants no sandwich bread etc all empty had to times after half an hour i asked the responsable and then we were served within minutes there was enough staff to guarantee a complete buffet i know it was very busy with the family holidays but this is no reason to leave the buffet with empty baskets and plates the quality of the bread and croissants was excellent pancakes were with surcharge i think this should be included in the price
