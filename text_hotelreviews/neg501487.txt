one of my group has claustrophobia and avoids lifts we had to explain this to staff before we were shown the staircase which is only for staff the building is a maze and it was difficult to find them as they are not marked one receptionist in the spa insisted we use the lift despite our explanation possibly a language barrier not ours she eventually understood and showed us the stairs there must be plenty of people who have a problem with lifts
