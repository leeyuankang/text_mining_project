shocking and appalling yes i m not being dramatic here check in was given a very cold and impersonal reception ok whatever got the keys to my room went up to my room and walked into a room that someone had already checked into could have gone so very very wrong thankfully there was no one in the room but all of their personal possessions were there walked back to reception very poor response asked for manager she gave me an upgraded room which was actually the same room with a slightly better view of the london eye but the smell in the room was really really bad went down again finally after the attempt we got a decent room but hotel guests beware that there is a clear lack of security in the rooms also the breakfast was good but an absolute gong show every morning you have to line up and it is extremely stressful especially with little ones too many people not enough organization unfortunately don t think we will be staying here again
