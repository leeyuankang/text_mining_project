we reserved this hotel due to it s location and amenities including an indoor pool i was shocked when they limited our use to the indoor pool to a half hour since so many kids were staying at the hotel i paid for this amenity seems like a bait and switch when this amenity is taken away or extremely limited the breakfast buffet was disappointing the only things worth eating was the bacon ham hash browns and the toast the soggy wet eggs baked beans black pudding cereal was disappointing based on my reservation we paid about for a family of four i could have used that money and walked over to starbucks across the street and ate something more satisfying the front desk agent who checked us in was not that friendly
