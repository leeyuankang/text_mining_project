miserable staff at reception and unhelpful on departure as a couple celebrating our anniversary we upgraded our room to one with a view of westminster bridge and big ben but found that whilst it was a great view the bed in the room was an ordinary double strangely in another part of the room wasted on us there was also a sofa bed made up as though for four people in total would have preferred a larger room with one larger bed also we were disturbed by housekeeping times in the morning the first at just after really annoying they were looking to clean the room note checkout was room lighting was very poor and difficult to control from the so called remote harsh floodlights as opposed to calm and relaxing bed side lights for example would not stay here again
