the food quality wasn t what we d expected we had room service meals and although tasty they weren t anything special in fact the curry wasn t even as nice as our local pub the breakfast was very disappointing not only were we down in the depths of the hotel in a conference room the selection wasn t very good powdered scrambled eggs no choice to have different types of eggs tiny sausages tinned or frozen mushrooms frozen mini pain au chocolat no honey the choice and quality is better at a premier inn the automatic minibar is a con it should be clearly marked on the fridge door we ended up taking a beer home with us because we d moved the can to see what was behind if you wanted white wine you d end up paying for the red wine too
