i left my itab in my room i remember exactly we re i left it as we had a debrief before we went to our meeting and i used it then we ordered a pitza and the tray it came on must have been put on the top which is why i didn t realise it was missing until i went to use it on the train on my journey home after speaking to your housekeeping and sercrity none have had anything hand in so what s happened to it i last used it in your hotel and i have witnesses to prove that and do intend to take this matter futher
