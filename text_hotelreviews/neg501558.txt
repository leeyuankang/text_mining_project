the staff member on reception was really unhelpful i had booked rooms under my booking com account but the named person staying in the second room was my step dad this caused confusion when checking in and we were persistently told we had only booked room and to take the issue up with booking com even though we showed her the booking confirmation and that the status was confimed and the room paid for the receptionist didn t want to speak to the representative at booking com and said wouldn t help there was no room unless we booked again under the rate of the room that day now more eventually we persuaded her to speak to booking com and the issue was solved in seconds very unhelpful and caused stress to the start of our weekend having travelled up from devon with family
