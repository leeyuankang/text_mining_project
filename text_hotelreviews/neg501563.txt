would not recommend staying at this hotel i stayed here for nights in a inward facing room which felt as if it was constantly night time and the room also had very poor lighting necklace was also taken from the room to which i complained to the security team and advised after investigating the matter they accept no responsibility escalated this to the hotel manager but still awaiting a response bad communication between staff within the house keeping department as on one of the days i had different cleaners turn up to clean my room although it had already been done room service food also of a poor standard i stay in london on a weekly basis and assure you there are much nicer hotels for a lesser price
