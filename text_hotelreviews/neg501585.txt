we were given a wheelchair accessible room for some reason so no bath room smelt of smoke despite it being a non smoking hotel we were given a room with a view of another building despite it being a sunday and the hotel being empty booked this hotel because breakfast was included but when we arrived we were told this was a mistake and we d have to pay for breakfast if we wanted it
