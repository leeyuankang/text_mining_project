hotel room was disgusting there was pubic hair and toenail clippings all over the floor in the bathroom urine stains underneath the toilet seat dust on all surfaces and a massive build up in all corners of the room it was like it had not been cleaned for months i complained to the reception staff and they rudely just moved me to another room without any sort of apology when i had entered my new room i saw that it was in state as the room before however it was even dirtier i was tried and i couldn t be bothered to wait and complain anymore so i just had to put up with the outcome i went to the local shop and purchased some cleaning products and on my return i started to detail clean the room i had cleaned the main bedroom and was happy with my outcome ii felt clean again it was until i detailed cleaned the bathroom that made me want to be sick with the dirt that i came across i have complained to the hotel group and not happy with my overall compensation they offered me a free nights stay at the same hotel however i would never ever stay in this hotel again i am trying to upload some photo s that i had taken but unable at the moment i will be posting the photos on twitter and i have spoken to citizens advise to get a full refund i would advise booking at a different hotel you would be better off staying at a travel lodge
