although i enjoyed my stay and thought the breakfast was enjoyable i i thought it was completely overpriced especially as its buffet style that would be my only negative about the hotel if i was to stay here again i would have breakfast elsewhere there was no price list next to the breakfast so we didn t know how much it was before we sat down
