to be absolutely blunt two words the staff for the level of hotel it is obvious that they don t invest in good staff or customer focused staff training the staff are all non uk nationals which is a shame for visitors to the heart of london they really do not care if you enjoy your stay i would guess that as most are tourists they bank on never seeing you again so don t care what you think of their level of service the check in out dear is woefully understaffed at all times and it takes minutes for them to deal which each person in front of you and this was at quiet times once checked in don t plan on going to the bar or the restaurant without cash as they refuse to serve you regardless of room grade i have never experienced this anywhere in the world they treat their guests as untrustworthy from the start and they don t won t take contactless payments either it is the most un customer focused hotel i have ever stayed in in london everything is too much trouble regardless of how normal it is elsewhere
