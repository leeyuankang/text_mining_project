the staff on the doors were very friendly and helpful as was the young concierge who got us a taxi when we were going back to the airport they suggest you only ask for clean towels if you absolutely need them this would work if they supplied adequate towel rails to hang up the wet towels after use the lighting was complex and difficult to understand there were no beside lights so that i could read during the night when i couldn t sleep there are only restaurants one french whose food my husband doesn t like and the other japanese and i don t like the only edible food for us was from the room service menu there was no information in the room such as wifi passwords how to work the lighting etc it was all supposed to be accessed through the tv but that was useless there were lots of silly little cards dotted about telling you that this is the telephone etc we had booked in for nights and the although the beds were made after the first night the high gloss table tops were not and they looked extremely grubby we were checked in by a trainee with no obvious supervision because i am disabled i had to fill in what turned out to be a complex document whilst i was doing that she was talking to me she had a very heavy french accent and eventually i had to tell her that i could either listen to her or i could complete the form i couldn t do both thankfully she stopped talking until i was finished however her accent was very difficult to understand
