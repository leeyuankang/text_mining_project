checked in at and my room was given away for a room swap so someone could get a better view after much complaining they finally released the room so i could get hte kids to bed i found staff to be not very helpful the concierge knew nothing i helped the person at the desk when the concierge couldnt even answer a basic question it is so noisy this place is huge and holds tons of events so its constantly crowded and waits to talk to any of the staff every hour of the day
