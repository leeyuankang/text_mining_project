my bedroom had no natural light what so ever it faced on to a curved wall onto which there was some mood lighting this felt claustrophobic in the brochure for the spa there is a book full of information on the spa services but one basic question re opening times of the swimming pool was not addressed i read it from top to bottom but had to ask security services at the door for this information i decided to stay in this hotel for the pool re entrance area the security desk should be positioned where the concierge desk is situated and visa versa it is very offputting to have security as the first point of greeting nothing premium or exclusive in that
