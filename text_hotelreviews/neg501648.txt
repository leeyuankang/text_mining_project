the iron in the room leaked the water out as soon as it was put into the iron and something sticky came off the iron on to my partners top leaving black marks after mentioning it to the manager they arranged another iron for the room and arranged to have the shirt laundered with no cost which was great but then also said the technician found no fault with the iron and the marks were due to the high temperature we had set the iron at which was incorrect it was due to something stuck to the underside of the iron which came off on my partners top as soon as it heated up ive ironed for years now im sure i know which temperature to iron a cotton shirt also they added two extra drinks to our bill after returning the laundered shirt to us the following day just as we were checking out when we had already paid our bill in full first thing that morning they claimed my partner had three drinks in the bar the evening before instead of just one we disagreed with this and they claimed they would check cctv to investigate the situation so we paid for the extra drinks just to put an end to the matter but then they also asked if they could e mail us a receipt for the extra drinks charge instead of giving us a receipt there and then which i still have not received the email two days later and i found this very odd we wouldnt quibble over two drinks if we had actually had them but i feel it was to make up for the laundered shirt and due to this i would stay there again
