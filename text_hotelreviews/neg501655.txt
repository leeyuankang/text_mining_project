hi i have recently come back from one of your hotel at park plaza westminster as a loyal customer i like to mention that i was not happy with a few things which i encounted during my stay firstly i would like to mention that as i arrived to the hotel our luggage was not offered to be taken into my room in camparison on my previous visit the doorman offered to take my luggage to the room secondly as i entered to check in i mentioned clearly to the receptionist that i have booked rooms for myself and my family however as i entered my room i realised they gave us the wrong room which was smaller in camparison to what i ordered another issue which arose was that the lifts were not working and this had not been looked at finally i would like to add that i had to ask times to get a robe and slippers to my room
