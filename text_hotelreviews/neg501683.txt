despite having requested a family room for adults and a year old we had to pay an extra on checking in as we were told we had only booked for one person which was wrong we booked for our family had to ask times for a cot for my daughter which was finally brought to the room after despite being requested initially in booking and on checking in at and the further calls after using the stairs with pram and cases as the lifts became faulty was less than ideal for the location and look of the hotel it was a disappointment very overrated
