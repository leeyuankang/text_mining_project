my only criticism was that housekeeping arrived late in the day to make up my room generally around or i was normally out of the hotel most of the day since my trip was primarily business but i arrived back at the hotel around a time when i really needed access to the room floor it was for me an inconvenient time for housekeeping to make up the room not a major issue and i would strongly recommend the hotel
