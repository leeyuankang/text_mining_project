couple of things that need improvement we can t comment on the first breakfast we paid for because we missed it due to sleeping in but the second one was a big disappointment because the makeshift set up in the conference hall was not up to standard and the coffee was too strong solution given to us was adding water to it we understand this was on a weekend and the hotel was probably fully booked the breakfasts afterwards served in their proper restaurant were all good despite limited choices the staff were by no means rude but they indeed came across as a bit cold our ranking would be higher if the staff were more friendly we noticed that quite a number of their staff members housekeeping maids restaurant servers have difficulty communicating in english
