house keeping staff though very nice and polite will skip things when doing your room cleaning is so so room is dusty with smudgy glass surfaces terrace has lots of spider webs and once we saw a big one that can harm small children if they are bitten last three days they skipped shampoo and soap and tea replinishement once we left to breakfast and kept dont disturbe on as our personal belongings and valuables were not arranged yet we came back to find a house keeping staff inside our room with door closed if you get the to floors and you have a baby trolly yiu cannot use g to l escalators and its annoying that you need to switch elevators from g to l then from l to your floor as elevantors are very busy and the only elevator that goes directly from g to is the one shared with spa at and is very hard to get breakfast is very good but lacks variety and change as we spent days eating the same breakfast every day but it wasnt big deal sofa bed they offer in the living room is not comfy
