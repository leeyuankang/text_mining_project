the spa is full with children they are loud so you can t really relax they have a non children time but just the first and the last hours so you have to be really early bird or the last person in the spa to enjoy the quiet hour the bathroom s light switch decided not to work after few switch whole night the light was on in the bathroom which is very annoying when you just wanna rest not impressed oh and when you book booking com deal price in this hotel they give you a room designed for disabled people which is a bit depressing when you are not disabled this is in the small letter part so far as the receptionist told us not happy i don t think i will go back
