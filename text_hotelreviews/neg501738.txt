many upsetting events that made this hotel stay a nightmare my fiancee and i booked several rooms for us and our family as we were holding our wedding in london i do not recommend you to stay there very unprofessional welcome porter stood there watching us as we exited our taxi with tons of luggage without any offer from help from any of the staff from arrival till we reached the lobby we entered our room to discover it barely had any window this was made more horrendous as we told the lobbyist we were staying at the hotel as we were getting married in london that weekend the person at the lobby didn t even care the only thing we could do is pay an extra per night to get a decent room with decent lighting our room was supposed to be cancellable modifiable up to in advance we had tried to modify our booking a week before arriving as we had to shorten our stay from nights to nights instead of cancelling one night for free as they advertised the online booking wouldn t cancel one night under the excuse that there is no space available which makes no sense since i was just cancelling a night under the booking that i had they made us rebook the entire stay so nights at a much higher price around more expensive multiply that by rooms and the bill goes up significantly the cleaner came in while we were in the room and instead of properly cleaning changing the drinking glasses in the room she just wiped them with a cloth with no washing god knows how many people have had a drink from that glass there was also hair in almost every towel in the bathroom the hotel mistakenly cancelled the room of a family member and we had to waste min for them to find the booking again conclusion do not stay there it s overpriced and the level of service is worthy of a star hotel on top of the rip off with the booking modification
