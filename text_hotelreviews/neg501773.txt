car parking adjacent to the hotel was limited no hot tub in the spa was disappointing the welcome when entering the hotel was not what we would expect with this quality of hotel not greeted at the doors service in the restaurant for our evening meal was not brilliant and the standard of some of the food was disappointing undercooked vegetables and fatty meat mattress was too hard for our liking
