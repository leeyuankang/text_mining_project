the toilets in our room broke wouldn t flush times in days the air conditioning also did not work it was either full on or off in the hottest day in london during this summer meaning that we had to get out of bed every minuts to turn it on or off we reported these things to the front desk the ac was completely ignored and never seen to the wc was fixed each time but broke again within a few hours a broken toilet really does not work when your travel with small children when we checked out we brought up our discontentment with these things we got to see a manager who promised to look into what had happened and get back to us before we were charged for the stay a few days later i received an e mail stating that they had investigated the ac and found nothing wrong with it they also claimed that the toilet breaking down was a very unusual problem and to compensate us they offered us a free upgrade of our room on our next stay i don t think so it is not on me to spend even more money on a hotel that does not deliver basic services to allow them to prove me wrong it was not even a very nice e mail but rather one that implied that our complaints were not valid and i will definitely not stay at park plaza again we also had an absolutely ridiculous exchange with the concierge before arriving asking for assistance on booking a taxi from heathrow to the hotel we started by sending a message though bookings com we then called the hotel the day before our arrival to check on our request were told that they would e mail us a form to fill out to place our order no form arrived we called again and were this time told that we should e mail them so that they cold send us the form we send the e mail including the flight details the next morning after i have already left for the airport i receive an e mail including a form
