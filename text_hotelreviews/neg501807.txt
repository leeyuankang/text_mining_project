i have stayed here many times before however on this occasion we were given an accessible room which was not to the standard i d had previously no front sitting area no microwave and sink area and no bath breakfast was served in the bar where the table only comes up to your shins which made eating rather awkward especially when you re lots to choose from though and very fresh and tasty
