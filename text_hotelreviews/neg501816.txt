we stayed six nights in a junior suite the first room we stayed in the wifi did not work at all in the bedroom and only in areas of the sitting room whenever you wanted to connect you needed to forget the network and reconnect we complained about it from the first evening again on the next day and only after days did they say there was a router issue on our floor rather than fix the issue they moved us to another room the wifi worked great there and the views were still fantastic however there was a marked difference in housekeeping standards the toilet and bathrooms were not restocked each day only limited offerings and any dirty glasses were not collected or washed this second suite also only had one phone not two and no laundry bags or luggage rack at this level of hotel you expect attention to these small details and a consistent experience across all rooms it being a large hotel expect to queue for reception and front office guest support and advice on another note since our last stay at this property two lanes of the westminster bridge have been closed to taxis or cars the traffic getting north of the river is therefore awful and can add another minutes to taxi rides just to cross the river given the season the bridge was also crowded which makes it hard to get to westminster tube station
