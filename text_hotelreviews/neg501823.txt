booked a superior room via booking were provided with a shoebox with no external walls and a very small window that overlooked the lobby hotel eventually found us a replacement room but we were made to pay an extra for the privilege of natural light we were in a hurry to get to the theatre so very reluctantly accepted though the following morning requested a refund which the hotel agreed to the breakfast experience was also not good the website shows photos of a spacious restaurant overlooking westminster bridge unfortunately the reality is that this hotel is so large rooms that the restaurant is unable to cope with demand and therefore the majority of breakfast guests are unceremoniously diverted down to a huge conference area in the basement also with no natural daylight unlikely we ll stay here again
