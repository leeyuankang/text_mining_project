the waiting time for check in was too long each time that i approach the check in desk took me long to get my request solved for the check out there was an extra charge of several items from the mini bar that we did not consumed i explained around to the person in the desk that this was because we requested the room service to remove some items as my daughter has nuts allergy and we did not want to have them in the room as i noticed that the response time was long i said i will come back later to give the desk clerk time to find out about the situation when i come back at midday it was not still cleared and i was told that not all the items were removed etc i had the impression that i was expected to pay for them or to keep waiting to get that cleared at the end i was a bit upset and had to be unkind to get rid of the situation as i only had more hours to enjoy the city before departing and did not want to invest time on the reception desk of the hotel shower of the fitness area were a bit disgusting dirty and the floor of the swimming pool was also dirty i could feel some things in my feet in at least two different spots i tried not to think about that and enjoy but i have been in better swimming pools from stars hotels
