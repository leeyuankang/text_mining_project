the hotel website says it s sound proof although i don t hear traffic noise but there is a door to another room locked though and i can hear the radio music and chatting from the next door this is very disappointing and annoying luckily the people next door were very quiet at night i m not sure i ll use this hotel again in the future if i want somewhere quiet
