i had lunch at joel s brasserie one of the internal restaurants i didn t like it pasta was overcooked the sea bass overcooked too and poorly presented and extremely expensive luckily you have plenty of restaurants nearby the hotel is big and crammed with people you feel more like you are at an airport or train station
