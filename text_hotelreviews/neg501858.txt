staff engagement was very poor you really did feel you were under a compliment by staying in their hotel we didn t meet any member of staff who bothered to smile or make us feel welcome their interactions were all very robotic with no personal touch which was quite disappointing we expected more we also found the room quite basic with very poor views and staining on the carpet
