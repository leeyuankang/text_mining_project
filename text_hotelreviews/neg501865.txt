room booked for people but only set up for people so had to make my own bed service charge for bringing drink to table but was asked to sit down and be served breakfast we were taken to a low table and chairs and was rather abrupt with us when we asked for normal set up i ve stayed at the hotel before and was disappointed at this stay
