the catering staff let the hotel down having arrived later than expected to the hotel we ate in the primo bar and all chose to have a cheeseburger with chips granted it was later on at night that we were eating and we had a limited choice to what to have but we waited an hour for our food when my dad complained about the wait time the woman told us that there was only one chef on and that someone had to go out to get some ingredients when the food arrived the chips tasted exactly like macdonalds fries knowing that someone went out to get ingredients and there is a macdonald round the corner i am convinced they served us their burgers with macdonalds fries
