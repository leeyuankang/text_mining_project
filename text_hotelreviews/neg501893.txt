there were no bath robes no slippers from toiletries only one shower gel and one shampoo there were hairs on bathtub when first time entering toilet interior is done so that you think there are a lot of shelves but there is only one small wardrobe the other shelves are just for decoration rooms are dark when you close the curtains and turn all the lights on the light is not enough the safe was too small even inch ultra thin laptop did not fit inside the staff always made mistakes we paid for the breakfast during check in the next day our names were not in breakfast list and we were not allowed to go to restaurant for breakfast we were forced to go to reception to check by ourselves go back to restaurant to ask them to check from reception finally they found what was the problem and we were allowed to have breakfast lot of inconvenience waste of time for about minutes telephone handset is connected to base with remote control and never worked i had to talk by speaker on the base waiters are untidy always spill coffee or tea on the table should improve the service the service is not as you expect when entering the hotel the hotel is very beautiful from outside but when you live there even one day you ll get disappointed
