when my husband and i checked in the staff give us a room with no windows no telephone signal inside the room very cornered location in floor and just seperated from a big lounge by a sealed glass wall that is all i got after paying per night we came from asia and i believe they will not give any european people that kind of room in that price when i back to reception ask to change another room because i need to use my telephone in the room the staff who with no apology argued with me said that could be the problem with my telecom company until i show her my phone got signal right in the lobby i d rather not saying this but this hotel is totally rubbish
