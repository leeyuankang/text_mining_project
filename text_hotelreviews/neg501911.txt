delay during check in apparently no rooms available they then tried to upgrade us to a studio room along with the price tag or give us the last disabled access room to my suprise behind us at check in was a disabled guest i was firm and said i ll wait for our original booking to be available hour later still no room so i sent my girlfriend to ask another member of staff and suprise suprise the room was immediately available this and the breakfast eggs tasted odd to me this ruined what otherwise was a perfect score
