pool had been booked prior to our stay we were not advised that the pool would not be available the purpose was for my husband children to access the pool whilst i used the spa it was awfully embarrassing for us to be told as we arrived to the spa reception this could have been avoided we of course engaged our children with a different activity to managed their disappointment
