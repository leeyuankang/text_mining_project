when i made the booking i was under the impression it was for a double room however as we checked in i was told that only a twin room was available i asked if this could be changed as i was staying with my husband for our anniversary but i was refused the only option i was given was to pay for an upgrade so i did i asked for the upgrade to be a room with a view of either the big ben or the river but again i was told that would be at a further cost no help or consideration whatsoever after a four hour car journey this was the last thing we needed great start it was then in the morning as the house keeper was making her house keeping rounds she entered our room without permission totally unacceptable again another awful start to the morning seems like the park plaza staff were keeping to the theme lovely hotel and location not sure sure about the staff completely spoiled the start of our celebration
