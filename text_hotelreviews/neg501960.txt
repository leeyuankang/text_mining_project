i booked myself and my son age for two nights in a twin room including b fast via booking com the confirmation only printed one adult so i rung the hotel to inform them and they said that this was typical of booking com not to include the child on the booking as it normally only states adults they would rectify it at check in i got an arrogant male receptionist who insisted that my booking was for one adult and therefore my son would have to pay for b fast i explained i had called the hotel and they said they would rectify this he wanted to know what day and what time and who did i speak to he insisted that children over pay for bfast as per their website i explained i did not book via their website but on booking com which included b fast in the rate to cut a long storey short i reluctantly agreed to pay as it and after a flight and six hours of travel it was not the time or place for an argument it was all very upsetting made more so when my son over hearing the conversation said he would do without bfast a final word from the receptionist was to direct me to guest services shame he did not say this initially instead of having the argument with me when i spoke to guest services i dealt with a person who listened understood how booking com works and removed the bfast cost i feel the hotel needs to train its receptionists to use common sense not to argue with a guest checking in late with a child and not to argue about the particulars of a booking when they are not involved in reservations it was unnecessary and upset my son and initially spoilt the first impressions of this hotel which is otherwise wonderful in every other way and in a perfect location for seeing london
