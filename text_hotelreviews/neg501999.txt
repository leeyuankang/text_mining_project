front desk seemed pompous and rude wifi is terrible kicks you off every minutes or so concierge service are scammers we wanted the big bus tickets for a day pass we were going to get them at the desk because it seemed easier than printing them ourselves and the mobile option wasn t working the price was gbp online when we went to the desk they tried to sell them to us for and then gbp the man didn t seem to know what was going on he was just throwing out numbers and asking another guy who wasn t really paying attention we asked if they charged a fee or surcharge they said no so then i asked why they cost more than the website and they told me i was wrong about the price so i showed them the website and they said they would only sell them for gbp long story short the guy didn t really seem to know what he was doing yet he was confidently supporting a false proclamation i realize this is just a couple gbp s but this sums up my experience at this hotel we re going to charge more because we can and we don t care if it s justified or not do not recommend this hotel save money and stay next to the train line a little further away
