the food choice in joel s was very limited no plain steaks only a tournedos rossini and so we returned to our room had room service but phone calls later the kitchen told us there was only one fillet steak so we had to choose again and we noticed we have had room service charged twice on the bill after paying it on return home i didn t also like the fact i asked if i could take a sparking water to our room at breakfast and was told yes but stopped by another staff member and had it taken from me due to health safety the pillows were very big and you need to have a few flat ones for people with ageing bodies ie neck stiffness i had to sleep without one
