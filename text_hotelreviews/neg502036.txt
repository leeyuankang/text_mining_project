this is a room hotel but the facilities don t support it restaurant pool etc are all on the small end for a hotel much smaller than this wait in a long queu to go to breakfast sent off to ballroom with makeshit setup because restaurant full staff and mgmt can t keep up with their size with high volume of staff a lot walking around aimlessly and not well trained staff members pass you and you still can t get a coffee refill one assumes you have a view of the river and big ben but the majority of the rooms face the other direction to buildings and very dark to get any view it is a very costly upgrade to almost the price of the original room not service oriented felt like i was in a factory advertise for families but assumes children sleep on an uncomfortable pullout may work for a toddler but that is about it would never stay here again
