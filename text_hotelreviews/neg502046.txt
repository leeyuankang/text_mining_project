we really did not appreciate the loud rapping on our hotel room door at a m by the maid followed immediately by her accessing the room using her pass key clearly a woman with only one thing on her mind to clean the room no regard for the time and certainly no regard for the fact that she had not been invited in no regard for the fact that we had paid for the room and it was still ours for at least another couple of hours more we had deliberately stayed in this hotel to enjoy the entertainment female singers who were terrific by the way so this unscheduled rude awakening after a late night really took the shine off our whole stay having been woken up we then felt obliged to set off in search of a sensibly priced breakfast the plaza charges per person for a basic english breakfast outrageous even by london standards for a few eggs and bacon etc what a shocker
