pool staff was far too rude on telling me off about my years old jumping into my hands i don t think he understands that the children are so excited to be there in london and also in the hotel and pool they get excited and it takes a couple of times for them to understand that this is not allowed on the second time he told me off i tried explaining to him that they will stop but i don t particularly want to shout at my children how ever they did stop but never the less he attitude is bad
