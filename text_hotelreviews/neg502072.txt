extremely dark inside room with no window that looked outside so no natural light or fresh air even turning the lights on full didn t make it bright we expected to have a decent view of outside at breakfast but again no window or natural light only scrambled eggs on offer and had to pay if you wanted eggs another way cramped self service area for the price we would have expected much better and will stick to the hilton in future
