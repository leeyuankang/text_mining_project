the room is much smaller than i expected the aisle between the tv and the relaxing bed could not even let the breakfast table pass it was preposterous that for two consecutive mornings the housekeeping lady knocked my door around a m asking if she could come in making up the room what kind of hotel does housekeeping at a m especially when i would stay for more than one night and in the first morning she just came in directly without receiving my response which rudely woke me up and i sat up at once topless although i am male i don t consider it very courteous eventually she folded her eyes with her hands and escaped immediately which was super awkward did i have to hang a do not disturb sign to remind people there might be somebody sleeping in the room at in the morning
