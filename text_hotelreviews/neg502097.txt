we had a dreadful experience in the sushi restaurant were we treated very poorly however we mentioned this to another member of staff who dealt with the matter very efficiently and professionally i didnt like that it was so busy and you had to book into the swimming pool i didnt like that i got stopped when returning to the hotel at midnight on my own by the security guard however many others arriving were not stopped
