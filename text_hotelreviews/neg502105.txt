i was unhappy with the attitude of the waitress when i said that my chicken was pink and i was worried it was unsafe to eat eventually i got another another dish but she tried for a long time to persuade me to eat the first one and sighed when i insisted i was not going to eat pink chicken i was a bit disappointed with the cool temperature of the spa pool and that small children were allowed in the atmosphere was more like a fun leisure centre than a warm relaxing and tranquil spa
