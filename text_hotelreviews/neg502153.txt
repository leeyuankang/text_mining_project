check in staff were less than helpful and seemed overwhelmed by the ratio of waiting customers per staff not only had i paid for a more than adequate room i even requested an upgrade with plenty of notice to then be told at that our room wasn t ready and to come back within two hours despite all the relevant paperwork saying that check in was at we went off and had a coffee and were told we would receive a text notifying us the room was ready an hour passed and becoming increasingly anxious that our afternoon plans were approaching i went back to check in to ask if the room was ready to be told it had been ready for half an hour and i hadn t received a text message telling us so either this time the staff were even more abrupt blunt and shirty and didn t have much time to entertain the fact she couldn t find the paperwork i had already signed over an hour ago overall a shoddy experience and i should never have paid for an upgrade it should have been free
