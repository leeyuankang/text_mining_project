i requested no feather bedding but instead of the room being made up without feather bedding i had to leave the room after check in to have the bed re dressed as it was feather we had a problem with the mini bar when looking for items we wanted we didn t replace the one in front correctly and were charged for it on the express check out bill i phoned to have it removed from the bill and someone had to come to the room to check we weren t lying which they did while i was getting dressed i then went to settle the bill for the items i had used from the mini bar and the item was still on the bill even though someone had been to the room to check it so be careful to replace any items you have moved in the minibar to the place where they were as it works on a pressure sensor and charges you if you don t put it back correctly causing problems when getting dressed and delay at check out
