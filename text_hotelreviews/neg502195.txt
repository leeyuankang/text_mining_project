sadly despite the points mentioned in my likes i won t book to stay in this hotel again please read on the visit was to celebrate a significant birthday the birthday cake and preseco ordered to be in the room on arrival as a birthday surprise where not there very disappointing thirty minutes after a discreet phone call reminder to reception and the surprise was eventually delivered but the moment was lost the birthday cake fiasco was just bad luck i hear you say but the following issues are in a hotel charging premium prices absolutely unacceptable the tumbler glasses in the rooms kitchen where both dirty one having a white powder residue deposited up the inside the cutlery supplied in the kitchen draw was sticky to the touch and had clearly not been washed for sometime one of the cushions on the bed had a large dark stain on it disgusting but the biggest disappointment was breakfast we arrived at the restaurant at but where ushered to the lift by a member of staff who told us to select the basement on arrival we entered a large multipurpose room which had been setup as an overflow dining room the room was soulless and more reminiscent of a school canteen than a hotel dining room we where led to a table next to a large flatscreen tv set up for the benefit of the younger guests the disney film playing was so loud that we had to raise our voices to be heard by the waiter serving the tea and coffee my wife and i wandered over to the buffet table to be greeted by a junior guest playing sand castles with the cereals nuts and dry fruit
