we booked this hotel because of the location and the spa facilities this was a big factor in choosing this hotel when we arrived we were told this was closed and not in use was deeply disappointed as we would have book another hotel slightly cheaper because there was no spa we had no phone call or email to say this was the case and there was no information on their website to say this was closed also out room was really dusty if your going to have so much glass then it really does need to be kept in good condition i would stay again but would not pay that price with no spa in action
