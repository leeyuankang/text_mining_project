the pool and spa were closed the week i stayed which was not indicated when i booked and was a big reason i chose the hotel there was maintenance in some rooms so it was incredibly noisy with banging and sanding floors or something happening all around me the interior rooms are stuffy with bad air flow and the lighting is very dark
