staff overcharged me for clothes cleaning instead of mangers were very unhelpful i kept complaining as nothing was done to compensate me for the inconvenience very rude and patronising especially young white male manager then a tall asian manager was helpful after all the trouble i have stayed there a few times in the past this occasion made me never want to return they had also overcharged a couple that was standing next to me checking out charged them twice for room rate
