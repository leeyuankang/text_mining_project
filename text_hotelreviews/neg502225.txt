we had been given a room we did not like due to a mix up with the booking company when requesting another room the response we received was unsympathetic and unfriendly our request was a simple and straightforward request so i find it difficult to understand why we had received such an unpleasant tone by the staff i strongly suggest your staff working on their customer service skills
