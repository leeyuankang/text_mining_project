service at the sushi restaurant we waited for at least minutes before getting service then one girl came up and asked if we were ready after those min and we said yes and she told us she had to get the other server to take our order we waited more minutes and just left and ate at the bar which was fantastic and affordable for a hotel like this the service should be much better like at the bar our server was amazing
