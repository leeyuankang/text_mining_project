room lighting was very dim but the room itself was quite nice check in and out was very inefficient and took a very long time not the most welcoming staff service at the cocktail lounge was very slow and inattentive our bags were loaded into the wrong hired car to the airport by the concierge valet we found our correct car on our own due to little concern from the valet all that said i will give big kudos to the illy coffee shop inside the hotel great food great service and an amazing view of big ben very cozy spot we ate our breakfast there every morning
