cleanliness was not as good as it could be on entering the room the toilet had not been cleaned thoroughly so not a good first impression good size room studio however very fiddly light switches with too many options made it difficult to use the various lighting options give me a basic on off switch twin beds in the room had a camp bed feel and were not very comfortable with plastic under sheets which didn t make for the best night s sleep overall layout of the hotel is a bit disorganised with reception and check in on the first floor which is ridiculous when you have a lot of luggage and small children overall style over function would not stay here again
