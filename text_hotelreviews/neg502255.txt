the fire evacuation at was not a good experience especially not for our year old who is extremely traumatised as a result we just hope it was real and not merely a fire drill having seen other comments on travel websites relating to fire drills at unreasonable hours the room was also not sufficiently cleaned there were still food from the previous occupants in the fridge and they did not wash the water glass next to my bed when i left it there in the morning
