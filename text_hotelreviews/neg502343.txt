i booked via booking com several monhs in advance to attend an event with the family only to find out several weeks before that due to family circumstances i couldn t make the date i originally booked when i tried to cancel i was told no refund would be possible even though i was giving a months notice but was offered another date which i took up only to find it wouldn t be a free date change just another to pay for two nights eventually got this reduced to just over for a date change which left a bitter taste considering the amount i had already paid i would recommend you check cancelation fees prior to committing to any booking as i will in the future
