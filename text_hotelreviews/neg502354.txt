the majority of the staff we met did not have english as their mother tongue and although we managed without problems it seemed a bit strange to speak better english as a foreigner in a british hotel it seems that all the money has been splashed on a very expensive room interior but then there is no budget for maintenance the curtains were not properly attached to their rails and doors were hanging tilted in their hinges it was also frustrating to come back after a day in the city at and not find our room cleaned yet they were about to start but we were exhausted and wanted to take a shower i expect this to be done at the end of the afternoon and then there is the overall feel of the place they want to create an elitish feel to the whole place which meant that i didn t really feel welcome in my jeans t shirt the beautiful dining room they boast about in the pictures is only for executives or if you pay pounds extra
