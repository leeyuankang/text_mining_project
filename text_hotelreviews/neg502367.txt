i was appalled at how dirty the hotel was our room had plastic on the floor and was dusty the chairs in the bar were tatty and their were crumbs over the floor the toilets were dirty the breakfast was overpriced chaotic and the food was not good it s the perfect location but next year will opt for the premier inn
