the facilities at the hotel was very good but poorly managed the staff were inexperienced and some had poor attitude i asked to promote for higher category room did not pay much but found out the room was smelling like damp it clearly was closed for some time and not been attended to there in room dining service was quick but the food was not so great for the price the shower had no water pressure but was enough and if two people were using the toilet one only gets hot water
