location is perfect rooms in general are great but bathroom for the disabled is terrible for the normal people why it was room with accessible room because booking com did not let me properly know about even microsoft windows asks are you sure you want to delete it the accessible room can not be a default room at booking time it should be specifically requested however both booking com and park plaza westminster bridge hotel think more about profit rather than happy customers as result we were suffering days in the room with defective bathroom speepery flow b c it for the wheelchair not for human feet low sink tub no hooks on the wall alarm ropes everywhere etc was tremendously inconvenient
