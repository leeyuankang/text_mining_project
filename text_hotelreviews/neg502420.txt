the washroom was too dark for make up occasional shortfalls in service examples when i asked room service to send someone in and pick up the heavy meal tray i was asked to put the tray outside the door of my room instead as a result the glass of unfinished fine dropped out of the tray and left a mark on the carpet i had an issue with one item on the bill when i checked out instead of sending someone from concierge up to talk to me the front desk officer asked me to go down one floor to speak with concierge and then go up again to settle the bill when i had pieces of heavy luggages with me not thoughtful at all don t go to the japanese restaurant in the hotel the sashimi wasn t fresh and was overpriced for that quality
