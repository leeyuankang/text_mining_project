breakfast venue was slightly disappointing compared to the rest of the hotel a nicer breakfast venue was available for vip guests there was a discrepancy with our mini bar bill which took a couple of hours to get sorted even though we were waiting to check out the guy at customer services was very helpful but the mini bar team responsible for checking weren t available and didn t appreciate any sense of urgency apologise for any convenience a sensor driven system is great we hadn t drunk anything but my niece had moved a bottle in the fridge but when a discrepancy is raised it would be useful if it could be sorted quickly particularly as we were only on a one night trip to london and so were keen to get out and explore
