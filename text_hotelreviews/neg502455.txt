the check in receptionist was utterly rude when she was arguing that my booking had been cancelled when it had not she refused to accept this and was so derogatory towards me by turning the screen round and tapping it to say it is cancelled i insisted on speaking to the manager who confirmed my booking as per the booking reference and i checked in all ok the receptionist however never apologised once clearly she needs training to do her job and in basic manners avoid oana when you check in or out
