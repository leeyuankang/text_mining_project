spa facilities having spent a lot of money to use the spa facilities they were very poor it s only a small swimming pool yet children kept bombing into the pool and screaming not the relaxing environment we hoped for having spent a lot of money in the spa for a hen do it would have been nice for everyone s treatments to have been the same as they were not yet we were all booked for the same also as a therapist myself a general rule of thumb during massage is to never loose contact and if you do there s a certain way of doing it wasn t just me this happened to and made the treatment not as relaxing
