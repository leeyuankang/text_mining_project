i have been so extremely upset and utterly amazed about how horrible of an experience my partner and i actually had in your hotel i guess i ll begin where the first red flag was as we were checking in a lady came up to another attendant behind your front desk counter and said i just checked out and i need help with something the female attendant said there was nothing she could do to help her since she had already checked out of your facility i should of known then this was not going to be a pleasurable experience then we stepped into your bar area and spent over pounds eating and having a couple drinks we realized at that moment all we had in our wallets were all and needed some change we asked the bartender if he could give us change he said no he couldn t because he couldn t open the till which i understand but seconds later we were still sitting there and someone came up and paid for a drink with cash he opened the register and then closed it again full well knowing we were still sitting there and was hoping for change of some sort we then were of to see a show on the west end we returned at around we were looking for some sort of dessert place or ice cream i went to the desk of the customer relations and a gentleman was very rude to me and said he was not the concierge i had no idea what his title was but instead of guiding me to the concierge he just went on with his discussion with another employee leaving me standing there then we went downstairs and found the concierge counter they also were no help to me not knowing where we could find desserts or ice cream i find that baffling that in london at there s no where to go we walk out of your hotel and now it s after and we find two places not even a block away but because it was now after they were closing and not accepting any new customers
