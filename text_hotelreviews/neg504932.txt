the price inflated to over times the normal rate for the fortnight because it is near the wimbledon tennis event at the deluxe double was disappointing having only the small round window at the front for natural light at over times the price it was outrageously expensive advantage well and truly taken the staff bored uninterested and far too few of them at breakfast on one morning we waited minutes to get our drinks the few staff there were like headless chickens slightly better on the second day as there fewer guests but still very poor some tables were set properly ours wasn t not fun eating cereal with a teaspoon eggs not cooked as i requested when we arrived at our room there was a huge pile of laundry just outside the door not a good look on arrival at check out we weren t even asked how we enjoyed our stay just as well as the bored reception clerk was answering the phone it was a two star experience for star prices
