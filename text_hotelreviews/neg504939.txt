we came down for a drink around pm and there was nobody in the lounge bar area but all the tables still had empty glasses on them service very slow breakfast same issue most of the tables empty but covered with plates etc from previous guests asked for brown bread got white for lunch asked for a nicoise salad and the person behind the bar taking the order had no idea what that was at pm asked for a full afternoon tea to be told there was none left even though it serves this until pm it s a lovely property but the staff and service let it down sadly
