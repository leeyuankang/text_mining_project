the hotel was rather shabby a lot of scuffed scratched walls and paint work floors not cleaned properly no quiet place to sit bar area full of hustle and bustle from staff we had to request a remote for the t v then we had to have someone reconnect the t v and for the rest of our stay you had to move close to the t v to change channels breakfast on the first day not bad on second very poor barely cooked tomato mushroom over cooked with leathery skin order was wrong waiter had to return with missing food still waiting for our toast even though we requested it twice had to ask for plates to be removed not a relaxing experience over priced hotel for what we received the reality did not match our expectations
