the restaurant staff were very courteous and friendly but in my opinion the service was disjointed due to not having one person allocated to look after our table thus resulted in having to remind any passing staff about certain things which took a bit longer to materialise than expected service at breakfast provided a similar experience and toast was completely forgotten until well after the cooked breakfast was finished the complimentary wi fi in the room was so slow that i used mobile data for any internet searches streaming video from bbc news etc was not possible
