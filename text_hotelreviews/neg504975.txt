dining staff seem to be overwhelmed this is the only hotel where i have had to wait for a table at breakfast this is not surprising given how long it took for breakfast to be served the previous evening a few friends joined us for drinks in the orangery and staff seemed uninterested in whether we wanted anything we had all just eaten at the ivy chelsea garden where the service was impeccable and this really show up their service
