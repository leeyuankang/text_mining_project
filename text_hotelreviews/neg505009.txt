such a shame on this visit we were up in the eaves and the lift was broken we had to climb the stairs cross across the landing to the other side of the hotel then up another two flights of stairs and across the landing again very popular normally plenty of parking space but a couple of times we struggled to find a space but it is a working hotel had breakfast in the conservatory girl who served us was very nice but pretty useless as a waitress another couple at a table near were not happy with the time they waited for their breakfast which was strange because it was not that busy we ordered two eggs benedict at a m coffee arrived at table i had to ask the waitress at where was the breakfast she apologised and said it would be one minute we ordered tea and more coffee as ours was cold the breakfast did show up and was excellent but the tea and coffee did not come until we had finished our breakfast which is strange because the bar with the tea and coffee is just across the room i have read lots of reviews about poor service at breakfast time and if cannizaro want to be the best they really have to train their waiting on staff and preparers of beverages and food it was as if they staff were children and had no clue how to organise anything very strange when i booked out i was asked as usual was everything o k i mentioned the lift they had come to fix a problem but did not have part and had to order it and the time taken for the food to arrive apology but not compensation offered i will be writing to them direct it has not put me off this place i love it in our room they have a basket with crisps chocolate biscuits popcorn etc with price list and not cheap the basket was put in the window cill the sun was shining in all day i would not be happy buying any of these products knowing they had been sitting in very hot sun
