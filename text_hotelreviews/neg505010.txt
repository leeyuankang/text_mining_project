this hotel used to be the tops but has gone off a lot since changing hands the service was poor for example the reception desk was not staffed when we wanted to check out and the breakfast service was in the hands of a person who was stressed had no idea how to make the coffee and was very slow the impression is one of very busy juniors with lacklustre middle and senior management the rooms are ok just the d cor is somewhat bizarre and the furniture is on the old side main problem with the rooms is the noise the doors don t close soft so you are woken by late comers and even the wardrobe doors close with a bang no matter how careful you are we have stayed here a lot but this time were very disappointed at over per night we expected much more
