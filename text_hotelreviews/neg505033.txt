payment requested on arrival probably because hotel concerned that they had allocated us a room above a party no mention of party at time of arrival or when booking the noise level was such that the floor of our room was shaking with the music a noise level which meant we couldn t talk to one another without shouting and when the music stopped there was an external door being used below our room which was continuously banging shut until we subsequently noticed on another review site that this was not a new occurrence for this hotel and so we will not be returning and would not recommend it
