the restaurant service is inconsistant very slow and staff don t listen quality and presentation of food changes by the day and breakfast items are just thrown at you e g i ordered cheese without the charcuterie menu said types of cheese i received a plate of sliced cooking cheddar one day i got pieces of toast the next day i got hotel is very expensive for what it offers and does not reflect the hotel du vin branding also if there is a function on it is difficult to get a table in restaurant even if you are resident
