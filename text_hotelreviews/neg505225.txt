there s no elevator or lift in the hotel if you bring big luggage and get the highest floor it will be a big trouble like me since i travelled with my mommy older people fortunately hotel staffs really helpful in bringing our big luggage to hotel room but my mom still complained because she still need to climb up to reach our hotel room
