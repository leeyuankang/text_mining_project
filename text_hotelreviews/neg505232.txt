we had a standard canal view room which was gorgeous and so efficiently laid out we barely spent any time in the room other than to sleep so the rooms smallness didn t hinder us at all but i would not recommend more than people to stay in it there was a strange smell in the room just barely detectable i think it might be the canal though the three flights of stairs were no issue at all for us who are in shape and pack light but might be for others
