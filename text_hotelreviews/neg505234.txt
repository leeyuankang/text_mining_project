no air conditioning in the rooms we had to change the rooms three times there was no air conditioning in the first room we we given on the floor was very tiny and very hot the hostess proposed to have the window located behind our bed open this did not sound like a confortable sleeping arrangement to us so we asked for a cooler room and were given a second chance the room was on ground level big but hotter than the previous one perhaps on our request the host opened the window just a little bit it was impossible to open the window more because of it s position the tram lines are located on the street the room was facing and garbage bins are located under the room not confortable and very noisy all night our booking was for five nights so we requested a better room or our money back the manager offered another room kindly explained that this is the last room change and that the weather is a bit hotter than usual in amsterdam is not hot in anyone s terms the third room had no aircon but a small window that we kept open during the night it was manageable but not confortable after all we came on holidays to amsterdam and we wanted a confortable room what is disappointing is the fact that back in march we enquired if the room that we have booked had an aircon and received an email confirmation on the march from emma k stating yes other issues the hairdrier is attached to the wall in the bathroom and a button has to be pressed on non stop while drying the hair these style of hairdryers belong well back to the past i preffer to sit while drying my hair not to stand in a hot bathroom pressing a button the floor of the shower cabin floor is sleek and slippery no tissue paper ear buds or cotton balls are available in the bathroom in my opinion this cute hotel would be good for younger audiences and perhaps more for guests accustomed to european standards of hotel services
