rooms are beyond small tiny tiny and with a bathroom in it imagine the smallest studio room and it s smaller they have no air conditioning working in this property even though the kit is installed they say it s not operational the rooms heat up and your only option is to open the window which then brings in flies from the canal which suck your blood during the night and you wake up with huge bites the property has no stairs so you have to walk up seriously steep stairs every time trust me this gets tiring even for fit people they have a minibar in the room which they don t tell you is free until you check out staff member tells us this is so you drink in the bar so why have a free minibar the place is just overly cramped tiny rooms stuffy and uncomfortable it is not a star not even close star definitely and at a push a star would never stay here again and we are far from the type who complain
