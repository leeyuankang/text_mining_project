i thought the room at was expensive for what we got the shower was hard pressure the beds were two singles pushed together so you have a lump in the middle the view was absolutely awful and there was rubbish out on the ledge bit i didn t realise but apparently the guy fawkes night where people run through the streets was on sat night making the night time rubbish and i hated the room if it was half decent i wouldn t have minded staying in there staff should warn people of that night and you should make it clear so to sum up hated the room hated the view hated the shower part and hated that i didn t know anything about this firework rampage not very happy at all i wish i had stayed further out to be honest
