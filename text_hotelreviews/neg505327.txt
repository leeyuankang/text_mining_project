we didn t like the look of the hotel from the outside some of the staff were either rude or unhelpful we weren t aware that we had no breakfast in our order through booking com and this was not made clear it made it a very expensive stay the picture we were sent of the room was misleading also and was very much smaller even though it was classed as a king size executive suite
