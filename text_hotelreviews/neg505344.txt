we had some difficulty in getting taxis arranged by the staff but that is not their fault we could not understand this as the cabbies in london are pretty mad about uber so you would think they would be grateful for the call we had one cabbie stop tell us he s the one they called and then tell us he wasn t picking us up no explanation the hotel was also pretty upset about this
