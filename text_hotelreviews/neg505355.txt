this hotel had been one of the worst experiences i ever had they have absolutely no tenant respect and don t know what room privacy is at all they just barge in your room day or night whether you have the do not disturb sign or not it could be a man a women or the cleaning crew that opens the door without ringing the bell the rooms aren t as website shows the bathroom is literally square and you could forget any maneuvering space you can ignore the hotel restaurants or the room service you re better off getting mcdonald s takeaway than eating in here i blame bookings com for their review and images as they were false and misguiding and would never waste my money on this hotel ever again shame on you bookings com and shame on this hotel that doesn t deserve the royal or the hotel in its name
