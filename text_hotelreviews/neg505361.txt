i did not like that the sofa bed was not made up and they did not have linen provided when we discovered that it was not made i was given a lecture about it being on request only why have a sofa bed in the room if you don t expect people to use it the other thing was the stairs i had hurt my back a few days prior i even told the check in person but when she gave us our room number there were several sets of stairs to navigate and no one offered to help with my large bag i would have expected that from a luxury hotel which is a brand they use for themselves
