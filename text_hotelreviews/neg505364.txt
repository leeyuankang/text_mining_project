stay here for business time was not too bad so booked again for ease of location for my business visit giving them a second chance hell never again upon arrival they didn t have my reservation then asked to see my confirmation about times on my phone making me feel i was some guy who just turned up off the street then was told that the credit card machine was not working so took down my card number and was told this would be processed the next day following morning when checking out was told to make payment for the room told the receptionist that i had paid when i checked the day before but she told me no payment was processed so gave her card to make payment later checked my statement to see that i have been charged the first time when i checked in and then charged again checking out went back to hotel and was told by the receptionist that i will just have to wait days for it to be credited back into my account you have been warned double check that you have not been charged twice overall stay was average stayed in better hotels bathroom very horrible cracked tiles loose grout from the floor tiles horrible dirty yellow stained bath tub and shower curtain tv in room was not looked after remote control not working tv stations is a joke horrible building site view from window never be back again
