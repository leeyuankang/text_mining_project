very tired place i mean inside and facilities rooms tired and very small curtains cannot be fully used so if you need curtains closed you will have a big problem stuff is ok but it depends my girlfriend asked for a comb and reply was no in hotel where standard room cost more than gbp this is a joke another thing is that on one side is construction site and if you get this side eg all suites be sure you will wake up on it could be a good place if it s for half price otherwise it must be rebuild from scratch to return breakfast is awful
